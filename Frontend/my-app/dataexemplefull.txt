The Polisario Front was formed in 1973 in Mauritania to fight for the independence of Western Sahara, initially against Spain and later against Morocco and Mauritania . In 1975, the UN International Court of Justice declared the Sahrawi people's right to self-determination over Western Sahara . In October 1975, the International Court of Justice ruled that self-determination was incompatible with Morocco's historical claims . In November 1975, King Hasan II ordered 300,000 Moroccans to march into Western Sahara in what became known as 'the Green March' . Spain withdrew from Western Sahara in 1976 without holding a referendum, deferring sovereignty to Morocco and Mauritania ."

The Roman perspective on the siege of Saguntum was often exaggerated for ideological purposes . The Celtiberian settlement of Numantia, near modern Soria, chose suicide and destruction over surrender to Scipio Aemilianus in 133 BCE . This act of defiance has been reinterpreted throughout Spanish history to inspire resistance against foreign powers and promote national unity .

In 1695-96, a Moroccan expedition commanded by Mawlay Ismail's son Aḥmad was defeated by the Algerians, prompting Mawlay Ismail to redeploy forces from the Ceuta siege . In 1696, Mawlay Ismail concluded another truce with the Algerians, aided by a letter from the Ottoman Sultan . In 1699-1700, Mawlay Ismail's son, Zaydān, led a foray into the Tlemcen area but concluded a truce, angering his father . In 1701, Mawlay Ismail undertook an expedition into Algeria but was defeated by the dey of Algiers . In 1707, Mawlay Ismail again entered Algeria, reportedly seeking to take Oran, but was defeated by Spanish forces ."

The territory, formerly known as Spanish Sahara , had been a Spanish colony since 1884 . Spain's colonization began with an expedition led by Emilio Bonelli under the presidency of Antonio Cánovas del Castillo, and a Real Decree in December 1884 proclaimed the territory between Cabo Bojador and Cabo Blanco (Rio de Oro) as a Spanish protectorate . Villa Cisneros (now Dajla) was founded as the first Spanish settlement . In 1963, the United Nations listed Western Sahara as a non-self-governing territory . In 1966, the UN General Assembly urged Spain to organize a referendum on self-determination for Western Sahara ."

The conflict stems from Spain's withdrawal from the territory in 1975 and the subsequent occupation by Morocco and Mauritania, leading to a struggle for self-determination by the Sahrawi people, represented by the Polisario Front . The Western Sahara was colonized by Spain in 1884 . In 1973, the Polisario Front was founded as one of several factions fighting for independence from Spain . In November 1975, the Moroccan government mobilized 350,000 Moroccans to march into the Spanish Sahara in an event known as the Green March . The Madrid Accords, signed in November 1975, transferred the administration of Western Sahara from Spain to Morocco and Mauritania . This transfer, however, excluded Algeria and the Polisario Front . The Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) was proclaimed by the Polisario Front after Spain's withdrawal in 1976 ."

The construction of the wall led the Sahrawi army to transition from guerrilla warfare to a war of attrition .

This enclave was maintained for about 50 years . The reconquest of this territory became an objective for Spanish governments, especially during the second half of the 19th century . Spain's victory in the War of Africa (1859-1860) against Morocco positioned Santa Cruz de Mar Pequeña as a potential war prize . Negotiations between Spanish monarchs and Moroccan sultans eventually led to Spain's establishment in Sidi Ifni in 1934 . A Spanish column occupied the Ait Ba 'Amran territory at Sidi Ifni in April 1934 without resistance . Ifni became a military garrison and administrative headquarters of Spanish West Africa . The effective occupation of Ifni happened in 1934, during the Second Spanish Republic, led by Colonel Osvaldo Capaz ."

In 1975, as Spanish colonial authorities were preparing a referendum on independence, Morocco invaded the territory .

By 1979, the Polisario rebels eliminated Mauritanian forces, leading Morocco to seize control of Western Sahara’s southern region .

After 9/11, Morocco attempted to portray Polisario as susceptible to 'Jihadism' to maintain U.S. support . The United States has consistently supported Morocco in the conflict . France is accused of blocking progress by protecting Morocco in the Security Council . Spain and France are involved due to their historical colonial roles . The EU is implicated through a fisheries agreement with Morocco in Saharan waters . In June 2004, the U.S. awarded Morocco a free trade agreement and major non-NATO ally status . Spain has abandoned its long-standing position of neutrality on Western Saharan independence from Morocco . In March 2022, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez sent a letter to the King of Morocco expressing support for the Moroccan autonomy proposal of 2007 as a resolution to the Western Sahara conflict . In December 2020, then-US President Donald Trump recognized Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara, conditional on the normalization of relations between Morocco and Israel .

The French colonial administration, which controlled Algeria for 132 years until its independence in 1962, gradually expanded its influence into areas claimed by neighboring Morocco, leading to future disputes . France's actions included the occupation of areas like Gurara, Tuat, and Tidikelt in 1900 and 1901, and the establishment of a \"line of operation\" in 1960 following the Draa River ."

Cordoba flourished as a cultural center, excelling in science, philosophy, medicine, astronomy, poetry, and history . However, the Caliphate of Cordoba disintegrated after the death of Al-Mansur's son, Abd al-Malik, in 1008, giving rise to the Taifa states by 1031 . These Taifa rulers lacked the unity to effectively resist the Christian kingdoms in the north . Until the early eleventh century, Christian kingdoms in Spain suffered military defeats from Al-Andalus rulers . Al-Mansur (978-1002) led approximately fifty campaigns against the Christian north, sacking Barcelona in 985 and Santiago de Compostela in 997 . The Taifa period saw the end of a unified judicial policy in Al-Andalus . The political fragmentation and weakness in Al-Andalus created the conditions for the later Almoravid intervention ."

The empire was known for its riches in gold and held a preeminent role in the western Sahel . The first mention of the empire of Ghana is found in the works of the astronomer El Fazzari just before 800 A.D. . Arabic writings mention that the Empire of Ghana had existed since the second century A.D. . The empire has been equated with the Soninké people’s legend of Wagadu . David Conrad argues that the Soninké knew the ancient kingdom as Wagadu . The word ‘Ghana’ means ‘king’; the inhabitants of the country were the Sarakole . El Bakri suggests 'Ghana' is a title meaning 'Chief of War' . Some believe the name 'Ghana' is derived from the Arabic adjective 'ghanna', meaning beautiful ."

The study of the Taifa Kings era (1013-1086) and the role of the 'ulama' (Muslim religious and legal scholars) provides further context for understanding the events leading up to the battle . Contemporary historians often view the Andalusi ulama as a homogeneous group, but this view is challenged by dividing them into \"mosque ulama\" and \"palace ulama\" . Most historical sources for the Taifa kings era are narrated from the point of view of a subset of the mosque ulama who opposed the Taifa kings and supported their overthrow . The battle is also examined through the lens of mythos and logos, analyzing how poetic and historical narratives shaped its memory ."

Upon his return to the Maghreb in 1117, he preached against the decadent lifestyles of the urban population and was expelled from Bejaïa for his extremism ."

During this period, Cordoba became a major center of wealth and culture in Europe, flourishing due to agriculture and trade . However, the Umayyad Caliphate was abolished in 1031, leading to the emergence of smaller Taifa kingdoms . These Taifa kingdoms, ruled by local notables, were militarily weak and forced to pay tribute to the advancing Christian kingdoms .

The Almohad Empire was a key player in this dynamic . The defeat also impacted later events, such as the defeat of the Portuguese by the Moors in Alcácer Quibir, which contributed to the rise of Portuguese Sebastianism, a form of royal messianism . Jacqueline Hermann's article discusses royal messianism in the Iberian world between the 14th and 16th centuries, tracing its roots back to the Middle Ages and its development in the Modern Period . The defeat at Alcácer Quibir created a specific political context that fueled messianic expectations ."

At the first meeting of the Conference on January 16, 1906, the Duke of Almodovar (Spain) was elected president . By February 7, 1906, there was complete agreement on the matter of tax reforms at the conference . On February 3, Revoil proposed to Von Radowitz that the mandate for the police be shared with Spain as a concession, a French strategy to enlist U.S intervention . On February 4, White expressed support for the Franco-Spanish proposal, stating it met the maximum equity and logic required of France . On February 6, White wrote to Root that France would not yield on the matter of the police . On February 8, Von Radowitz talked with White and Venosta again, proposing that the Sultan have control of the police but with instructors from three secondary powers, a plan White refused to endorse . On February 13, Germany sent a telegram indicating they would rather disrupt the conference than retreat further . From February 14-15, White and Revoil had conversations that resulted in the White-Revoil formula, with the recommendation for Roosevelt to recommend a compromise to the Kaiser . On February 16, White recommended that Germany either accept the French proposals or end the Conference . On March 7, Roosevelt sent a letter to the Kaiser urging acceptance of Roosevelt's recommendations . On March 8, the Austrian delegate proposed a plan to assign French police to certain ports and Spanish police to others, with Casablanca under an Inspector General . On the 14th of March 1906, a French ministerial crisis ended and the Kaiser sent a stronger telegram to Roosevelt denouncing the French . On the 17th of March, Root informed White that The US stood for freedom of commerce and a limited control by France and Spain through a multi-lateral mandate . Roosevelt made a public statement praising Germany and it's leaders on April 12 1906 ."

The first known British trading voyages to Morocco occurred in 1551, driven by interest in gold, saltpetre, and sugar . James Aldy's account of this voyage provides insight into early British experiences in Barbary . England and Morocco found common ground against Spain, with Morocco providing saltpetre for English gunpowder in exchange for arms . Elizabeth I chartered the Barbary Company in Morocco, which produced crucial economic and political benefits for England . The Barbary Company was formed in 1585 under the Earl of Leicester to foster trade relations . In 1583, Lord Burghley advised Queen Elizabeth on the suitability of an alliance with Morocco ."

In 218 BCE, a consular army was dispatched to Northeastern Spain to counter Hannibal's advance on Italy, marking the beginning of a broader conflict . A large portion of Spain was under Carthaginian control due to the Barcids during this period . The Senate decided to vigorously pursue the war in Spain, creating a series of extraordinary proconsulates in 217 BCE . From 218 to 197 BCE, the command structure in Spain shifted between one and two 'summi imperatores' (supreme commanders) appointed through senatorial decrees and popular laws . The Romans established a network of garrisons in Spain to secure the hinterland, facilitate recruitment, and provision armies ."

The toponym 'Mazagan' is possibly of Berber origin, with forms such as 'Mazighan' appearing in texts from the 11th and 12th centuries . Duarte Pacheco Pereira described Mazagan around the beginning of the 16th century, noting the location of a destroyed city . In the summer of 1514, construction of the castle of Mazagan accelerated under Portuguese military protection . Some strategists questioned the need for a fortress at Mazagan given the fortress being built at Azamor . Mazagan began as a small protectorate of the Portuguese crown in 1486 . After the conquest of Azamor in 1513, King Manuel I ordered the transformation of Mazagan into a bastioned fortress to protect the Carreira da Índia . In 1541, Mazagan was transformed into a grand fortress city, considered the first 'ideal city' of the Renaissance built outside of Europe ."

The hiring of an Italian engineer played a major role in the construction of the Mazagan fortress . The experimental process and knowledge transfer involved in the construction of Mazagan went beyond a simple technical delivery from the center to the periphery . In 1541, Benedetto da Ravenna inspected Portuguese cities in Morocco, including Septa, Tangier, and Mazagan . Benedetto da Ravenna's plan for Mazagan is considered the first perfect European bulwarked fortification . In 1541, Benedetto da Ravenna and Miguel de Arruda visited Mazagão to modernise the fortifications . Francisco de Holanda drew the initial model for the fortifications at Mazagão applying the bastion system, though he never visited Mazagão himself . The construction of angled bastions in Mazagão started in 1541, potentially impacting discussions on fort design ."

The examples of Morocco after Moulay Ismail's death, the Safavid dynasty after Ismail I's death, and Egypt after Khedive Ismail's deposition illustrate the diverse ways in which these conflicts can manifest and the significant impact they can have on the stability and development of a region . Understanding the dynamics of these conflicts provides valuable insights into the complexities of power, succession, and political stability in historical contexts ."

This protectorate granted France administrative, political, and military control over Morocco . The actual conquest and pacification of the country took twenty-two years after the signing of the treaty . Even before the formal establishment of the protectorate, tensions were rising. The murder of Dr. Émile Mauchamp in Marrakech on March 19, 1907, served as a pretext for French military action . Hubert Lyautey used this event as justification for the French occupation of Oujda, a significant step in establishing the protectorate ."

This event was the culmination of increasing European influence and internal strife within Morocco . Prior to the treaty, Morocco faced numerous challenges, including a weakened state, internal rebellions, and financial instability . Sultan Hassan I attempted reforms in the late 19th century, but faced resistance . The defeat in the Battle of Isly in 1844 further weakened Morocco and increased European influence . After Hassan I's death, Sultan Abd al-Aziz's reign (1894-1908) was characterized by financial instability and internal rebellions, including the Zerhouni rebellion in 1901 . Moulay Hafid began considering taking over from his brother Abd al-Aziz as early as 1907 and was proclaimed Sultan in Fez on August 15, 1907, under conditions of expelling Europeans ."

The garrison faced sieges between 1418 and 1419 by Marinid forces and a Granadan fleet, which were eventually broken by the arrival of a Portuguese relief force . D. Pedro de Meneses established a reconnaissance network using watchtowers and sea patrols to monitor enemy movements . The garrison relied on supply ships from Portugal to maintain the city and prioritize experienced warriors to minimize casualties . The Portuguese utilized mounted units in skirmishes outside the city gates, feigning retreats to draw enemies into range of crossbow fire . During sieges, mounted units harassed enemy siege lines and sabotaged attacks . The local Moroccan armies generally had superior numbers of mounted units compared to the initial Portuguese garrison . The Portuguese acquired horses through raids on North African villages and purchases from foreign markets . The 'Casa de Ceuta' in Lisbon was created to supply the fortress, including horses and war materiel . Portuguese raids on North African villages targeted cattle, including horses . The Portuguese used almogavars (light footmen) for reconnaissance ahead of the main force during raids . The Portuguese garrison, after withstanding initial challenges, expanded its area of influence through raids and skirmishes . D. Duarte de Meneses, son of D. Pedro, adopted a more aggressive military policy, using tactics like feigned retreats . D. Pedro de Meneses died in Ceuta during the disastrous expedition to Tangiers in 1437 . Portuguese forces attempted to take the castle of Tetuan in 1435 but were repelled . The garrison used naval assets to support land forces, transporting footmen to coastal targets while cavalry moved overland ."

The period following the Wattasid takeover, from 1465 to 1580, is described as a \"Hundred Years War for Morocco\" . This era, encompassing the early modern Maghrib, was characterized by warfare and state building . The Wattassids ruled in Maghreb al-Aksa . However, the Wattassids, along with the 'Abd al-Wadids and the Hafsids, experienced a decline in their authority . The Wattassides and 'Abd al-Wadids disappeared from the political scene in 1554 . The conference series focuses on European sources of the history of the Maghreb from 1492 to 1578 . The fall of Constantinople in 1453 and the Reconquista of Granada (1482-1492) are mentioned as contextual events . The source also discusses the impact of European powers and the rise of Ottoman influence in the Maghreb . The Hafsids declined approximately twenty years later ."

Some argue that the Knight may have fought for Sultan Muḥammad V of Granada . The siege of Algeciras in question happened in late July 1369, directed by Sultan Muḥammad V . The Knight's military career included service in the Levant, eastern Baltic, and kingdoms around the straits of Gibraltar . The Knight fought in Algeciras and is linked to the emirate of Morocco (Belmarye, Banū Marīn) . King Alfonso XI of Castile took Algeciras from Granada in 1344 . In 1344, Alfonso's Iberian-Genoese coalition defeated an army sent by the Moroccan Sultan Abū’l-Ḥasan ‘Alī to relieve Algeciras . Sultan Muḥammad V was an ally of King Pedro I of Castile and sent troops to help him fight Enrique de Trastámara . After Pedro’s murder, Muḥammad V took territory along the border, including Algeciras . Muḥammad V allied with the Marinids and Zayanids . The Marinid emirate of Fez in Morocco and the Zayanid emirate of Tlemcen (in modern Algeria) were allies of Granada . The Knight may have fought for Muḥammad V from late March 1369, through the siege of Algeciras in late July 1369, and into the 1370s . The source suggests the Knight may have been involved in the campaigns to take Gibraltar and Ceuta for Granada in 1372 . The Knight’s potential service with the Zayanids involved pushing the Marinids out of Tlemcen ."

The Marinids' rise coincided with the decline of the Almohad empire, which led to the emergence of three states: Ifriqiya, the extreme Maghreb (Marinids), and the central Maghreb, controlled by the Abd al-Wadid dynasty . The Abd al-Wadids, a Zenata tribe, established an independent dynasty in the central Maghreb, with Tlemcen as their capital . The Banu Abd al-Wad were part of the Zanata Berber tribe and shared nomadic origins with the Marinids . The Marinids, initially nomadic, expanded their power by incorporating Zanata from central Maghreb and Arab troops into their armies, supplementing them with mercenaries . The Marinids' expansionist ambitions brought them into direct conflict with the Abd al-Wadids of Tlemcen . The Abd al-Wadid dynasty's history involved a double relationship: with the Almohad caliphate in the 13th century and the Marinids from the 14th century onward ."

This treaty divided Morocco into zones of influence, with France controlling the majority of the territory and Spain administering the northern and southern regions . The Algeciras Conference of 1906 had already recognized the rights of both Spain and France to exert influence in Morocco . The establishment of the protectorate, however, did not occur without resistance. The Berber tribes, in particular, mounted a strong opposition, besieging French forces in Fez in April 1912 . The Rif War (1921-1926), led by Abd el-Krim al-Khattabi, further demonstrated the strength of Moroccan resistance to colonial rule ."

The Comité d’Action Marocaine (CAM), created in 1934, emerged as the first overtly nationalist party, advocating for reforms and a stricter application of the Protectorate regime . The CAM, led by figures like Allal al-Fasi, Mohamed Bel Hassan El Ouazzani, and Ahmed Balafrej, sought to abolish direct administration practices .

Morocco gained independence on November 18, 1956, due to the combined efforts of the Monarchy and the Istiqlal . The Istiqlal became critical of the monarchy after independence, believing they deserved to be in power . After independence, the title of 'Sultan' was replaced by 'King' ."

Internal divisions within the Istiqlal between the left wing led by Mehdi Ben Barka and the right wing led by Allal-el Fessie weakened the party . The Istiqlal mainly appealed to the urban middle class, limiting its overall support base . The Istiqlal split in 1958 over the issue of American military bases in Morocco . In January 1959, Prime Minister Abdallah Ibrahim formed a new-left wing party called the national union popular forces (UNFP) . The USFP is the successor of the “Union Nationale des Forces Populaires” (UNFP) which was created in January 1959 following internal division in the Istiqlal Party ."

The 'Arab Spring' revealed a demand for the 'right to the city' . Lamia Zaki's chapter examines urban resistance movements in Moroccan slums from the 1990s to the Arab Spring . The chapter analyzes the dynamic relationship between public action and popular protest in Moroccan slums . The study focuses on the impact of national and international contexts on mobilizations and the ability of slum dwellers to influence public action . The research examines the impact of the Arab Spring on informal settlements, assessing transformations in the 'Villes sans bidonvilles' (Cities Without Slums) program in Casablanca . The 'Villes sans bidonvilles' (PVSB) program was initiated in 2005 to eliminate slums in urban areas . The PVSB program aimed to address 324,000 households (1.6 million inhabitants) in over 1,000 neighborhoods across 85 cities, including nearly a third in Casablanca . The article mentions the Mouvement du 20 février, the Moroccan version of the Arab Spring, and its impact . The study discusses the evolution of policies towards Moroccan slums, oscillating between prohibition, laissez-faire, promises of relocation, and threats of expulsion . The period following the Arab Spring saw increased difficulties for authorities to contain illegal construction and installations . The study highlights the creation of a national coordination of bidonvilles at the end of 2010 following the imprisonment of six residents of a bidonville in Mohammedia . The study mentions attempts by residents of bidonvilles to interfere in the attribution of titles and relocation ."

The study investigates how individuals with diverse backgrounds and experiences, including those with prior political activism and those new to political engagement, become involved in local associations . The associations studied operated in different neighborhoods: HH., a dense area of small collective housing built in the 1950s, and DS., a densely populated, older, and more commercial area . DJ association was founded in 1994 with the initial objective of raising the cultural level of the neighborhood HH after the elections of 1993 . Association M. for social development was created in 1998 around K., a deputy from the PJD (Parti de la justice et du développement) . AB association was also founded in 1998 around A., a former Marxist political prisoner, who became a local councilor . The study explores the actors' political competencies, distinguishing between technical/cognitive, social/status-related, and practical/pragmatic competence . The research examines the actors' feelings of injustice at local, national, and transnational levels, including issues like unemployment, poverty, corruption, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . The study analyzes the boundaries that actors draw between \"us\" and \"them\" at various levels (local, national, transnational), including social cleavages, ideological divides, and perceptions of the political class . The research examines the impact of these factors on their participation in elections, noting different patterns of electoral behavior depending on the actors' political identities and perceptions . The study explores the actors' involvement in demonstrations and sit-ins related to national and international issues, highlighting the connections between local engagement and broader political movements . The research analyzes the role of neighborhood associations, noting their potential as spaces for social action, network expansion, and the emergence of alternative forms of political participation . The study highlights the fluidity of political engagement and the connections between local actions and the broader political landscape .

The French and Spanish implemented language policies aimed at promoting their respective languages during the colonial period . The French sought to establish French as the preferred foreign language in liberated colonies and as part of the colonies' identity . The French created a division between 'advanced' and 'underdeveloped' languages, favoring European languages over languages from the 'Third World' . The French colonial administration emphasized the importance of education in solidifying French linguistic policy . The French established different types of schools, including those for the general public and those for the elite, with French receiving a significant portion of instruction time . In 1912, the French established the 'École supérieure de langue arabe et dialectes berbères', which later became the 'Institut des Hautes Études Marocaines' in 1921, to train translators and administrators . Throughout the Protectorate, the French language was used in various official documents and reports, becoming the official language of the colonial authorities . The French protectorate authorities damaged the status of Classical Arabic due to their support and promotion of the French language . The French established French-Amazigh schools in the Middle Atlas region to appeal to the Amazigh population, with a focus on teaching practical agriculture, basic arithmetic, health, French, and written Amazigh using the Latin alphabet . The 'Collège d'Azrou' (secondary school) was established in 1930 by the French, aiming to integrate French influence in the Amazigh mountains . Despite efforts, the Collège d'Azrou largely directed Amazigh students towards French education and did not rely on the Amazigh language, thus failing to achieve its goals . The Spanish Protectorate did not develop as deep a linguistic policy as the French, but the prolonged occupation and cultural measures led to the spread of Spanish in the northern regions . After independence, the question of language arose, with some advocating for the French language, others opposing it, and some trying to reconcile both positions . The introduction of colonial education in Morocco resulted in a cultural duality, dividing the intellectual elite into those educated in the traditional system and those educated in the modern system . After independence, the French language continued to hold a prominent position in Morocco, being taught from primary school to university and used as the language of instruction in several faculties . The Moroccan constitution of 2011 recognized the Amazigh language alongside Arabic ."

Spain's presence in Morocco was rooted in a desire to reclaim national honor after losing its American colonies in 1898 and to reintegrate into international alliances . European powers feared a Spanish agreement with another nation would threaten French sea routes and British control of Gibraltar . The Entente Cordiale of 1904 between Britain and France allocated a sphere of influence to Spain in northern Morocco . The Conference of Algeciras in 1906 stipulated that Morocco should be open to international trade and guaranteed the Sultan's sovereignty, tasking France and Spain with maintaining order in their spheres .

Belisarius's initial distrust of the African population was evident in security measures following the landing in 533 . A major revolt of Arian troops occurred in the spring of 536, taking the authorities by surprise . This revolt was partly caused by Justinian's anti-Arian policies and the actions of Vandal Arian clergymen who incited the soldiers . Vandal women also played a significant role in the 536 revolt, urging their husbands to reclaim land and opposing the suppression of Arianism . Subsequent rebellions, led by Stotzas (536-546) and Guntharic (546), continued to involve Arian soldiers and Vandals . The Laguatan, a Berber tribal confederation, also posed a significant challenge to Byzantine authority . In 523 AD, a Vandal army was defeated in Tripolitania by the Laguatan under Cabaon . In 543 AD, 79 Laguatan chiefs were killed at a meeting with Dux Sergius at Lepcis, leading to a major revolt lasting until 548 AD ."

Traditional scholarship suggests these groups migrated from prehistoric Scandinavia across the Baltic Sea, settling in continental Europe during the early imperial age . The Vandals underwent a transformation from primarily farmers to a society centered on horse breeding and mounted warfare, heavily influenced by Sarmatians and Alans . This 'Sarmatisation' affected their warfare, economy, dressing, and conduct . By the 5th century, the Vandals had become a major force impacting the Roman world ."
