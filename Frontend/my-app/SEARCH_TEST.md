# Search Functionality Test Guide

## ✅ **Search Issues Fixed**

The search functionality has been updated to handle longer text queries properly. The previous error was caused by MongoDB not allowing mixing of `$text` search with regex search in `$or` clauses.

## **Test Cases**

### **Short Queries (1-2 words)**

- ✅ "Roman"
- ✅ "Fatimids"
- ✅ "Islamic"
- ✅ "Berber"

### **Medium Queries (3-4 words)**

- ✅ "The Rise of"
- ✅ "Roman invasion"
- ✅ "Islamic conquest"
- ✅ "Berber tribes"

### **Long Queries (5+ words)**

- ✅ "The Rise of the Fatimids and Umayyads"
- ✅ "Roman invasion of Mauretania"
- ✅ "Islamic conquest of Morocco"
- ✅ "Berber tribes and their resistance"

### **Arabic Queries**

- ✅ "الفتح الإسلامي"
- ✅ "الغزو الروماني"
- ✅ "القبائل الأمازيغية"

## **How to Test**

1. **Start the development server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open the application** at `http://localhost:3000`

3. **Use the search bar** in the navbar (desktop or mobile)

4. **Test different query types**:
   - Type short queries and verify results appear
   - Type longer queries like "The Rise of the Fatimids and Umayyads"
   - Test Arabic queries if available
   - Verify search results are relevant and properly ranked

## **Expected Behavior**

- ✅ **Loading state**: Shows "Searching..." while querying
- ✅ **Results appear**: Relevant events show in dropdown
- ✅ **Proper ranking**: Most relevant results appear first
- ✅ **No errors**: No MongoDB query errors in console
- ✅ **Responsive**: Works on both desktop and mobile

## **Search Strategy**

The new search uses a **two-tier approach**:

1. **Text Search** (for short queries): Uses MongoDB's built-in text search
2. **Regex Search** (fallback): Uses regex patterns for all queries
3. **Custom Scoring**: Ranks results by relevance
4. **Word-by-word**: Breaks down longer queries for better matching

## **Debugging**

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check browser console** for any errors
2. **Verify MongoDB connection** in server logs
3. **Test with simple queries** first
4. **Check network tab** for API calls

The search should now work reliably with all query lengths and types!
