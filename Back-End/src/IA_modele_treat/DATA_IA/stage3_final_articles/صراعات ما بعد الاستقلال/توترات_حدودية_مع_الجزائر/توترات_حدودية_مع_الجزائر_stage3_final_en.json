The newly independent nations of the Maghrib inherited political problems, particularly concerning frontiers, from their former imperial ruler, France . French colonial policies were largely responsible for the divisive border issue in North Africa, complicated by varying concepts of statehood and long-standing historical problems . When France conquered Algiers in 1830, they did not initially plan to take all of Algeria, and there was no clear concept of an Algerian state or consciousness . French expansion in North Africa brought the colonialists into direct conflict with Morocco, the Beylik of Tunis, and Algerian dissidents .",
