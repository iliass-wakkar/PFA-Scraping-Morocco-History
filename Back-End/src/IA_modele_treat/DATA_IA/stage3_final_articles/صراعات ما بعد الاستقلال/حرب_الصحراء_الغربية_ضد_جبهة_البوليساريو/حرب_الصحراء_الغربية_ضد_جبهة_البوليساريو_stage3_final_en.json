          "text": "The Western Sahara War, also known as the Western Sahara conflict, is a protracted struggle for control of the Western Sahara, a territory in Northwest Africa bordering Morocco, Algeria, Mauritania, and the Atlantic Ocean . The conflict's roots lie in the decolonization era, specifically the withdrawal of Spain from the territory in 1975 . Spain began colonizing the Western Sahara in 1884, a process that wasn't fully completed until 1936, after which the territory became known as Spanish Sahara . In 1975, as Spanish colonial authorities were preparing a referendum on independence, Morocco invaded the territory . Spain transferred its colonial authority to Morocco and Mauritania in 1975, a move the UN largely deemed illegitimate .",

By 1979, the Polisario rebels eliminated Mauritanian forces, leading Morocco to seize control of Western Sahara’s southern region . From 1980 to 1987, Morocco built a system of earthen berms, supplemented with landmines, extending 1,690 miles (2,700 kilometers) from southwest to northeast of Western Sahara, as a military strategy . The 'Berm' is manned by 150,000 soldiers and controls 85% of the territory, while the Polisario controls the remaining 15% . The conflict caused the displacement of 100,000 to 150,000 people and resulted in the death of thousands of fighters .",

The UN Security Council issued a resolution calling for negotiations between the parties without preconditions, aiming for a just, lasting, and mutually acceptable political solution that provides for self-determination for the people of Western Sahara .

During the Cold War, Morocco portrayed the conflict as a proxy war between East and West, seeking U.S. support against Polisario . The Reagan administration provided Morocco with arms in the 1980s, helping it regain territory lost in the early years of the war . After 9/11, Morocco attempted to portray Polisario as susceptible to 'Jihadism' to maintain U.S. support . The United States has consistently supported Morocco in the conflict . France is accused of blocking progress by protecting Morocco in the Security Council . Spain and France are involved due to their historical colonial roles . The EU is implicated through a fisheries agreement with Morocco in Saharan waters . In June 2004, the U.S. awarded Morocco a free trade agreement and major non-NATO ally status . Spain has abandoned its long-standing position of neutrality on Western Saharan independence from Morocco . In March 2022, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez sent a letter to the King of Morocco expressing support for the Moroccan autonomy proposal of 2007 as a resolution to the Western Sahara conflict . In December 2020, then-US President Donald Trump recognized Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara, conditional on the normalization of relations between Morocco and Israel . France, the United States, Israel, and Spain are backing Rabat (Morocco) in the Western Sahara dispute . This backing is to the detriment of Algeria, which supports statehood for the Sahrawi people .",

Morocco has exploited Western Saharan phosphates since its forces moved into the territory . In 2002, U.N. legal expert Hans Corel deemed Moroccan efforts to exploit Western Saharan natural resources as illegal . The EU's relationship with Western Sahara, including economic engagement, is ad hoc and influenced by geopolitical and legal factors . The European Commission conducted public consultations in Western Sahara to examine the economic and human rights impacts of proposals .",

Polisario argued that international law requires a vote where independence would be an option and said it was under pressure to return to armed conflict . The Polisario Front proclaimed the end of the ceasefire with Morocco on November 13, 2020, after being in effect since September 6, 1991 . Algeria will continue supporting the Western Saharan independence movement's renewed armed attacks against Rabat’s forces in the Sahara . The conflict's drivers are dynamic, with tensions caused by war contributing to its continuation . The article suggests exploring free association between Western Sahara and Morocco as an alternative to independence or integration . A free association agreement would need to be accepted by the Sahrawis in a referendum .",
