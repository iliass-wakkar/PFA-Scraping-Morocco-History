          "text": "The construction of defensive walls in Western Sahara, also known as the \"Sand Wall\" or \"Berm,\" is a significant event in the ongoing conflict between Morocco and the Polisario Front . The conflict stems from Spain's withdrawal from the territory in 1975 and the subsequent occupation by Morocco and Mauritania, leading to a struggle for self-determination by the Sahrawi people, represented by the Polisario Front . The Western Sahara was colonized by Spain in 1884 . In 1973, the Polisario Front was founded as one of several factions fighting for independence from Spain . In November 1975, the Moroccan government mobilized 350,000 Moroccans to march into the Spanish Sahara in an event known as the Green March . The Madrid Accords, signed in November 1975, transferred the administration of Western Sahara from Spain to Morocco and Mauritania . This transfer, however, excluded Algeria and the Polisario Front . The Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) was proclaimed by the Polisario Front after Spain's withdrawal in 1976 .",

          "text": "Faced with a costly guerrilla war against the Polisario Front, Morocco began constructing a series of defensive walls, or \"berms,\" in August 1980 . Construction was completed in 1987 . The walls were built in six stages . The purpose of these walls was to secure phosphate production, protect the \"useful triangle\" including Al-Ayoun, Smara, and Bou Craa, and seal off the territory from attacks by the Polisario Front . The construction and maintenance of the wall has occupied the bulk of national military effort for the last thirty years . The United States provided intelligence assistance for the building of the defensive wall in the desert . France, the United States, and Saudi Arabia supported the construction of the berm .",

The walls are three to four meters high . The gaps along the wall are covered by high fences, multiple layers of barbed wire, electronic surveillance devices, and approximately seven million land mines . Forts are located every three to five miles along the wall, manned by as many as 100,000 Moroccan soldiers . The walls were defended by approximately 160,000 Moroccan troops . The Moroccan army installed surveillance systems along the wall, including alarm systems and radars . The radar systems used include Rasura and AN/PPS-15, capable of detecting movements within a 60 km radius . The external main line of the walls follows the approximate line of the border with Algeria and Mauritania .",

          "text": "The construction of the defensive walls had a significant impact on the conflict . The walls limited the effectiveness of Polisario raids and allowed the resumption of phosphate production . By building the walls, Morocco was able to consolidate its defenses and react more quickly to Polisario attacks . The walls cut the Western Sahara into two territories: the Moroccan-occupied zone and the POLISARIO-controlled zone . The berm bisects Western Sahara, dividing Sahrawis . The wall separates Saharawis in Moroccan-occupied territory from POLISARIO-liberated areas and refugee camps in Algeria . The construction of the wall led the Sahrawi army to transition from guerrilla warfare to a war of attrition . The wall negatively impacts the social, psychological, political, and economic aspects of Sahrawi life, including family separation, restricted movement, and hindering a referendum of self-determination . The Sahara Occidental has become the zone with the highest density of landmines due to the Moroccan wall's construction . More than 2,500 victims have been registered since 1975 due to the minefields around the Moroccan wall .",

In 1982 the United States and Morocco signed a joint military agreement, U.S. Green Berets were dispatched to the territory to help train and advise Moroccan forces, and the U.S. began providing intelligence assistance for the building of a defensive wall in the desert . U.S. support for Morocco, and the building of the berm in particular, was fundamental to its success in securing and maintaining control over most of the Western Sahara territory . France also supported Morocco, including its involvement in the Green March and the provision of military aid . The construction of the wall lasted for seven years with the aid of France and the United Kingdom . International bodies do not recognize Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara . The UN's MINURSO mission in Western Sahara is the oldest peacekeeping operation in Africa, established in 1991 . The MINURSO mandate has been prevented from expanding to include the monitoring of human rights due to opposition from Spain and France .",
