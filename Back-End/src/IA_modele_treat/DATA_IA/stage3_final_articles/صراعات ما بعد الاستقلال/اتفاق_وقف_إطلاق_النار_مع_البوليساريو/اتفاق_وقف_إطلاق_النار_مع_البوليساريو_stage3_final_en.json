          "text": "The conflict in Western Sahara, a territory on the northwest coast of Africa, has been a major unresolved colonial question . The roots of the conflict lie in the competing claims of Moroccan irredentism and Sahrawi nationalism, stemming from the arbitrary nature of colonial borders . The territory, once known as Spanish Sahara, was colonized by Spain beginning in 1884 . In 1963, the United Nations declared Western Sahara a non-self-governing territory to be decolonized . The Frente Polisario (Popular Front for the Liberation of Saguia el-Hamra and Rio de Oro) was formed on May 10, 1973, to fight for the region's independence, initially against Spanish colonialism .",
