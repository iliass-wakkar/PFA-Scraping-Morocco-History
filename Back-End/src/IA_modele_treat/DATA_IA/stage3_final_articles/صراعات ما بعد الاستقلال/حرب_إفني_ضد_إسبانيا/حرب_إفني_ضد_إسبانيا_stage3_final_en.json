          "text": "The Ifni War, also known as the Forgotten War, took place between 1957 and 1958 in the Spanish territories of Ifni and Sahara in Northwest Africa . Spain's interest in the area dates back to the 15th and 16th centuries with the establishment of Santa Cruz de Mar Pequeña, a Spanish enclave on the African Atlantic coast near the Canary Islands . This enclave was maintained for about 50 years . The reconquest of this territory became an objective for Spanish governments, especially during the second half of the 19th century . Spain's victory in the War of Africa (1859-1860) against Morocco positioned Santa Cruz de Mar Pequeña as a potential war prize . Negotiations between Spanish monarchs and Moroccan sultans eventually led to Spain's establishment in Sidi Ifni in 1934 . A Spanish column occupied the Ait Ba 'Amran territory at Sidi Ifni in April 1934 without resistance . Ifni became a military garrison and administrative headquarters of Spanish West Africa . The effective occupation of Ifni happened in 1934, during the Second Spanish Republic, led by Colonel Osvaldo Capaz .",

          "text": "The Ifni War occurred during the Francoist dictatorship and the decolonization and expansion of Morocco in the mid-20th century . Morocco gained independence in 1956 . The war was Spain's last colonial war in North Africa . The conflict was framed by the Franco regime as an invasion by guerrillas of the 'Army of Liberation' rather than an open war between Morocco and Spain . The Sultan of Morocco, Mohamed V, avoided openly declaring against Spanish interests, placing responsibility on the Armed Bands of Liberation (BAL) . The Armed Bands of Liberation (BAL) were a group that acted as the armed wing of the Istiqlal party . The BAL consisted of individuals who had participated in the independence of Morocco but hadn't integrated into the Royal Armed Forces . The initial BAL mobilization involved attacking the airfield and armory in Sidi Ifni, and other Spanish positions . The attack on Sidi Ifni, the capital of the province, occurred on November 23, 1957 .",

Twelve civilian ships were used to transport troops and supplies from the Iberian Peninsula and Canary Islands . The Spanish Navy deployed a Marine Corps contingent to establish a beachhead at El Aaiún . Naval vessels provided artillery support during joint operations with the Spanish Army and Air Force . The first expeditionary company of the Marine Infantry was formed on January 16, 1958, with 222 men, including a medical lieutenant and health personnel, and deployed to El Aaiún .

Naval hospitals like San Carlos (Cádiz) and the antituberculosis sanatorium in Madrid treated casualties from the conflict . The medical support system consisted of a stepped approach, starting at the front line, continuing at civilian hospitals in Spanish West Africa, evacuating severe cases to the Military Hospital of Las Palmas, and ultimately to mainland Spain if needed . The Sikorsky S-55 H-19 helicopter was used for the first time in combat for medical evacuations during this conflict .",

The Ministry of Information and Tourism enforced censorship based on the 'Serrano Súñer Law' of 1938, dictating press serves the state . The Spanish media emphasized the heroism of Spanish troops and the gradual return to normalcy . Following the Ifni War, there was a tacit agreement among media outlets to bury the dead and their memory .

The Plan Madrid, a result of an emergency meeting of the National Defense Board presided by Franco, marked a change in attitude toward Moroccan bands and a closer relationship with France . Spain had to seek French military cooperation during the conflict . The Ifni-Sahara conflict revealed the conditioned and limited nature of US military assistance to Spain .",
