          "text": "The Sand War (حرب الرمال), a conflict between Algeria and Morocco, took place in September-October 1963 . The war stemmed from a territorial dispute, specifically in the Béchar and Tindouf border regions . Morocco attempted to reclaim the Tindouf and Béchar areas, claiming they were annexed to French Algeria by France decades earlier . The conflict was influenced by ill-defined borders inherited from the colonial period . Regional problems in North Africa originate from boundary formation during the colonial period . The absence of a precise border, the discovery of mineral resources, and Moroccan irredentism fueled by the Greater Morocco ideology contributed to the conflict .",

In the 1890s, France annexed the Touat, Gourara, and Tidikelt, which had been part of the Moroccan Empire for centuries . France integrated Tindouf and Colomb-Bechar into the French departments of Algeria in 1952 . Morocco sought the return of disputed territories after gaining independence in 1956 .",
