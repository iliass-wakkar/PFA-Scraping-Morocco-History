          "text": "The issue of border demarcation has been a recurring source of tension and conflict for Algeria, stemming largely from the artificial borders drawn during the colonial era . The Berlin Conference of 1884-1885 saw European powers carve up Africa, creating territories that reflected European compromises rather than African interests, leading to artificial borders that have caused suffering and conflicts in post-colonial Africa . The French colonial administration, which controlled Algeria for 132 years until its independence in 1962, gradually expanded its influence into areas claimed by neighboring Morocco, leading to future disputes . France's actions included the occupation of areas like Gurara, Tuat, and Tidikelt in 1900 and 1901, and the establishment of a \"line of operation\" in 1960 following the Draa River .",

The French exploited this ambiguity to expand into the Sahara, a move protested by Morocco . This expansion was further complicated by the discovery of mineral resources in the disputed territories, contributing to Algeria's stance on maintaining the inherited colonial borders .",
