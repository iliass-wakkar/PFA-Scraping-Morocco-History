          "text": "The Green March (المسيرة الخضراء إلى الصحراء الغربية) was a pivotal event in the ongoing dispute over Western Sahara, a territory on the Atlantic coast of North Africa bordering Morocco, Mauritania, and Algeria . The territory, formerly known as Spanish Sahara , had been a Spanish colony since 1884 . Spain's colonization began with an expedition led by Emilio Bonelli under the presidency of Antonio Cánovas del Castillo, and a Real Decree in December 1884 proclaimed the territory between Cabo Bojador and Cabo Blanco (Rio de Oro) as a Spanish protectorate . Villa Cisneros (now Dajla) was founded as the first Spanish settlement . In 1963, the United Nations listed Western Sahara as a non-self-governing territory . In 1966, the UN General Assembly urged Spain to organize a referendum on self-determination for Western Sahara .",

Morocco had long opposed the independence of Mauritania, accusing the French in 1960 of attempting to partition Morocco by creating an artificial state called Mauritania . King Hassan II sought to integrate Western Sahara into Morocco, a move that was seen by some as an expansionist policy . The discovery of a phosphate mine at Bu-Craa in 1964 further intensified geopolitical interest in the region, attracting countries like Morocco, Spain, France, and the United States, who competed for control of the world fertilizer market .",
