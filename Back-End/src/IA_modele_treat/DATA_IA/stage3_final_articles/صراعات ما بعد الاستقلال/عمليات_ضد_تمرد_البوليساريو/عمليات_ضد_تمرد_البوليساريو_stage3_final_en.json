          "text": "The conflict in Western Sahara stems from the withdrawal of Spain in 1976 and the subsequent struggle for control of the territory . Spain's abandonment led to a division of the territory between Morocco and Mauritania . This division was opposed by the Polisario Front (Frente Popular de Liberación de Saguía el Hamra y Río de Oro), a Sahrawi liberation movement seeking independence for the region . The Polisario Front, representing the indigenous Sahrawi population, declared the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) in 1976 and initiated a guerilla war against the occupying forces of Morocco and Mauritania . The International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled on October 16, 1975, that the Sahrawi tribes had the right to self-determination, rejecting Moroccan claims .",

General Amed Dlimi reorganized the Moroccan military strategy in 1979, focusing on mobile units and relocating the civilian population .

This wall system included barbed wire, trenches, fortifications, and extensive minefields . The wall aimed to protect approximately 80% of Western Sahara and included over 300 fortified positions . The construction of the wall significantly hampered Polisario's operations, limiting their ability to establish bases and launch attacks . Despite the wall, Polisario launched attacks against Moroccan forces throughout the 1980s .",
