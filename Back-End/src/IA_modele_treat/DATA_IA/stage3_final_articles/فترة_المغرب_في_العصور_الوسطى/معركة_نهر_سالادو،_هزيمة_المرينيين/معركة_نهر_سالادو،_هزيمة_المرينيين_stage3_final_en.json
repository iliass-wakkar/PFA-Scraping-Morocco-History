          "text": "The Battle of Río Salado, fought in 1340, was a significant event in the context of the Reconquista in the Iberian Peninsula . The Marinid dynasty, a Muslim power controlling parts of North Africa and Iberian coastal ports, had become a major adversary of the Christian kingdoms in Iberia, particularly Castile . Alfonso XI of Castile, who reigned from 1312 to 1350, heavily relied on the Castilian navy in his military strategies, especially in the southern Iberian conflicts around the Strait of Gibraltar . Alfonso XI struggled for control of the Strait of Gibraltar, contending with both the Nasrid emirate of Granada and the Marinids . The Castilian navy played a crucial role in protecting shipping and coastal areas, gathering intelligence, supporting land forces, and engaging in direct naval confrontations .",

          "text": "The Marinids themselves originated as nomadic tribes in the Zab region, on the border between present-day Algeria and Tunisia . They were considered second-generation Zenata, following other groups like the Miknâsa and Banû Ifrân . Initially, they served the Zirid and Hammadid dynasties, guarding their borders . However, the Hilalian Arab expansion restricted their nomadic range . They offered limited support to the Almohad regime and later exploited the Almohads' decline after the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212 to expand their influence through pillage . For at least 25 years after their first victory over the Almohads in 1216-1217, the Marinids focused on plunder and tribute collection, lacking a distinct political or religious ideology .",

          "text": "The Battle of Río Salado in 1340 saw Alfonso XI of Castile defeat the Marinids . This victory is presented as a turning point in the Reconquista . A speech attributed to King Afonso IV of Portugal, delivered around 1380, connected the Battle of Salado to earlier battles between Christians and Muslims, framing it as part of an ongoing narrative of Christian victories . This narrative began with the perceived loss of Spain and focused on the reconquest of those lands by Christian ancestors . The *Livro de Linhagens* and the *Crónica de 1344*, written by Pedro Afonso de Barcelos, compiled stories relating to this narrative, and these texts underwent multiple revisions throughout the 14th century . The Reconquista of the Iberian Peninsula became a collective memory that gave meaning to the Battle of Salado .",
