The Portuguese occupation extended for more than two centuries and was marked by important events .

The Portuguese rebuilt the walls of Arcila and fortified them with towers and a watchtower . The Castelo in Tangier had round medieval cubelos at each angle except the south, which had a square keep (torre de menagem) . The square keep resembled the one in Arzila, with three stories, a battlemented platform, and corner bartizans . Around 1514, the platform on the north-east wing of the main corps de logis was likely transformed into a fully roofed top floor . Renaissance chimneys present in the Civitates view were gone by the mid-seventeenth century . A fountain or well was possibly located in the middle of the Castelo yard . A Portuguese hornwork with two half-bastions was erected to reinforce the Castelo novo's east curtain, likely in the 1560s during a modernization phase .",

The defeat of a Portuguese raiding party on January 12 left the town of Tangier virtually undefended . Almeida appealed to Sandwich for assistance after the January 12th Portuguese raiding party defeat . Sandwich sent ashore 80 seamen under Vice Admiral Sir Richard Stayner to secure Tangier . Sir Richard Stayner first occupied York Castle and seized other key installations in Tangier . Tangier was secured by Stayner's actions a fortnight before Lord Peterborough's arrival on January 29 . Stayner left Tangier late in June 1662 and died in Lisbon in early October .",

The free port of Tangier was intended to be an international free-trade environment for all merchants, modeled after Livorno and Genoa . However, Tangier was not successful as a Mediterranean free port . The English occupation of Tangier was marked by mismanagement, domestic political tensions, and Moroccan resistance . The English abandoned and demolished Tangier in February 1684 . Tangier had to resist the Moors in the 17th century while Morocco was vigorous .",
