They were initially nomadic tribes from the Zab region, located on the border between modern Algeria and Tunisia . From the early 13th century onwards, they began to expand their influence in the Maghreb . Their initial expansion was largely driven by plunder, and unlike the Almoravids and Almohads, they lacked a strong unifying religious or political ideology .",

The decline of the Almohad empire, particularly following the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212, and internal conflicts among Almohad claimants facilitated the Marinids' rise to power . Abu Bakr Yahya bin Abdul Haq al-Marini entered Fez in 642 AH/1248 CE, marking the beginning of Marinid rule in that city . The Marinids systematically conquered the Maghreb al-Aksa (modern Morocco) over several decades, capturing important cities such as Fes and Meknes . Prince Yaqoub bin Abdul Haq seized Marrakech, the Almohad capital, in 668 AH/1269 CE, effectively ending the Almohad state in the Maghreb . After the decline of the Almohad Empire, the Marinids emerged as one of three successor dynasties in 1258 .",

Another water clock was constructed on the orders of Sultan Abu Said in 1317 and restored in 1346 . The Marinids also contributed to the architectural heritage of Tlemcen, Algeria, with rich polychromic expressions found in geometric and floral shapes decorating minarets, porches, interior courtyards, and patios of buildings .",
