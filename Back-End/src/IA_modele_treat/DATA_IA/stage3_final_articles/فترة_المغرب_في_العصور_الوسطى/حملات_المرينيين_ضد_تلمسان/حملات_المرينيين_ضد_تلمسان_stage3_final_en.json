          "text": "The Marinid dynasty, originating from the Zab region in Ifriqiya, established themselves in the central Maghrib plains . They were a Berber dynasty who rose to power after attacking an Almohad convoy around 1145 . By 1269, Abu Yusuf invested Marrakech and was proclaimed sultan, marking the beginning of their rule in the Maghrib until 1465 . The Marinids' rise coincided with the decline of the Almohad empire, which led to the emergence of three states: Ifriqiya, the extreme Maghreb (Marinids), and the central Maghreb, controlled by the Abd al-Wadid dynasty . The Abd al-Wadids, a Zenata tribe, established an independent dynasty in the central Maghreb, with Tlemcen as their capital . The Banu Abd al-Wad were part of the Zanata Berber tribe and shared nomadic origins with the Marinids . The Marinids, initially nomadic, expanded their power by incorporating Zanata from central Maghreb and Arab troops into their armies, supplementing them with mercenaries . The Marinids' expansionist ambitions brought them into direct conflict with the Abd al-Wadids of Tlemcen . The Abd al-Wadid dynasty's history involved a double relationship: with the Almohad caliphate in the 13th century and the Marinids from the 14th century onward .",

          "text": "A major conflict between the Marinids of Fez and Tlemcen began around 1295, initiating a period of Marinid aggression . Under Abu Said Othman ben Ya`qub, the Marinids besieged Tlemcen for eight years, from 1299 to 1307 . During this prolonged siege, the Marinid Sultan Abu Yacoub Youcef built the town of Mansourah near Tlemcen as a military camp to replace Tlemcen . The mosque of Mansourah was built around 1303 by Sultan Abu Yacoub . The siege impacted the city and its population, causing hardship . The poet Ibn Khamīs al-Tilimsānī fled Tlemcen in 1305 during the siege . He composed nostalgic poems called Tilimsāniyyāt while in exile . The siege was lifted in 1307 due to the assassination of the Marinid sultan .",
