          "text": "The Portuguese presence in North Africa spanned from 1415 to 1769 . Driven by military ambitions, the protection of trade routes, imperial expansion, and the ideals of the Reconquista and the Crusades, the Portuguese sought to establish a network of military and commercial bases along the Moroccan Atlantic coast . This expansion, beginning with the capture of Ceuta in 1415, extended south and east, relying on advanced navigation skills and the introduction of flanking fire defenses . The Portuguese expansion project dates back to the late 13th century with the Treaty of Soria in 1291 . The victory over the Marinids in the battle of Salado in 1340 gave fresh impetus to the Portuguese expansionist intents . The Portuguese King Afonso IV got the enactment of the Papal Bull Gaudemus et exultamus in May 30th 1341, acknowledging the Portuguese Crown the right to conquer the Kingdom of Fez . The Aviz dynasty resumed the expansionist project, prioritizing the Atlantic strategy over expansion to Granada .",

The Portuguese King Dom Manuel I supported Crusades and aimed to dethrone Muslim power in North Africa . The Portuguese expansion in North Africa involved isolated enclaves along the Strait of Gibraltar and Atlantic coasts .",

Dom Afonso V's forces attacked and penetrated Asilah on August 24, 1471, taking the city by surprise . The conquest of Ceuta in 1415 marked the starting point of the implementation of this strategy and the benefit to the maritime cities involved in maritime trade with northern Europe . Ceuta was considered the key to the Strait, impacting commercial circulation to and from the Mediterranean and the safety of coastal communities . The capture of Asilah caused fear among the residents of Tangier, located 38 kilometers away, who abandoned the city, opening its doors to the Portuguese . By the end of 1471, the Portuguese controlled the main cities on the African shore of the Strait of Gibraltar . The capture of Asilah and Tanger marked the start of Portuguese rule in northern Morocco .",

References to 'old town' versus 'new town' suggest a new town grid scheme was established in Asilah by the Portuguese . The Portuguese urban fabric in Asilah included geometrically rectangular blocks divided by perpendicular and parallel streets to the main square . The Rua Direita, the traditional spine of Portuguese medieval cities, was present in Asilah, corresponding to either Tijara, Sidi Ali Ben Handouch, or Bab R’Mel streets . The Portuguese focused on street pavement and water supply in Asilah, including a public fountain . Structures known as couraças were built in Asilah, Tangier, and Ksar es-Seghir as early as 1502 to provide garrisons with easy access to water .",

The tower of the Portuguese castle in Asilah was in a dilapidated state when architect Viana de Lima began its restoration in 1987 .
