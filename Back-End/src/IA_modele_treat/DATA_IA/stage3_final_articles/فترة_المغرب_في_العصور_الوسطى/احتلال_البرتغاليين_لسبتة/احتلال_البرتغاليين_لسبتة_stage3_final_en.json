          "text": "Ceuta (سبتة), a city located on the North African coast at the Strait of Gibraltar, held significant strategic and commercial importance in the medieval Mediterranean . Its location made it a key point for trade between Morocco and the Iberian Peninsula, serving as Morocco's gateway to the outside world and a major transit point between Europe and Africa . The city was a central hub for Mediterranean trade and a crucial point of contact between Christian and Muslim powers . During the later Muslim period, Ceuta's strategic position and defenses were of great importance . The city enjoyed a period of autonomy, highlighting its significance in the Strait of Gibraltar region, which was contested by Christian (Castile, Aragon, Genoa, Portugal) and Islamic (Moroccan, Nasrid) powers .",

          "text": "By the early 15th century, Portugal, under King John I of the House of Avis, sought to expand its territory and influence . The Portuguese aimed for economical and commercial benefits, Europe’s recognition, and religious Reconquest through their seizures and foundations in Northern Africa . The conquest of Ceuta was seen as a way to demonstrate Portugal's legitimacy as a world power and to secure its position among other Christian monarchs . The notion of reconquest, with Portuguese kings claiming rightful inheritance to North African territories, also played a role . The Portuguese preparations for the attack on Ceuta were shrouded in secrecy, causing concern among other Iberian powers and even within Portugal itself . To maintain secrecy, King Dom Joao devised a pretext for the military preparations by challenging the Duke of Holland, threatening war due to injuries and thefts suffered by Portuguese merchants in Holland . Fernao Fogaca was sent to inform the Duke of Holland about King Dom Joao's plans and the necessity of a pretext to avoid alarming the Moors . The King also assigned preparation and administrative tasks to his sons .",

The fleet, consisting of 242 ships, sailed from Lisbon on June 23, 1415, carrying 50,000 soldiers and seamen . The landing occurred at the Almina beach, exploiting a defensive lapse by the city's defenders . The population of Ceuta resisted the Portuguese invasion but were ultimately overwhelmed . Gomes Eanes de Zurara wrote a chronicle describing the walls and moats crossed during the Portuguese conquest of Ceuta .",

          "text": "The Portuguese garrison, numbering around 3,000 men under D. Pedro de Meneses, faced challenges adapting to a different style of warfare centered on mobility and ambushes, unlike the heavy cavalry tactics they were accustomed to . Horses were essential for the Portuguese garrison in Ceuta for reconnaissance, raiding, and defense against the Marinid forces . The garrison faced sieges between 1418 and 1419 by Marinid forces and a Granadan fleet, which were eventually broken by the arrival of a Portuguese relief force . D. Pedro de Meneses established a reconnaissance network using watchtowers and sea patrols to monitor enemy movements . The garrison relied on supply ships from Portugal to maintain the city and prioritize experienced warriors to minimize casualties . The Portuguese utilized mounted units in skirmishes outside the city gates, feigning retreats to draw enemies into range of crossbow fire . During sieges, mounted units harassed enemy siege lines and sabotaged attacks . The local Moroccan armies generally had superior numbers of mounted units compared to the initial Portuguese garrison . The Portuguese acquired horses through raids on North African villages and purchases from foreign markets . The 'Casa de Ceuta' in Lisbon was created to supply the fortress, including horses and war materiel . Portuguese raids on North African villages targeted cattle, including horses . The Portuguese used almogavars (light footmen) for reconnaissance ahead of the main force during raids . The Portuguese garrison, after withstanding initial challenges, expanded its area of influence through raids and skirmishes . D. Duarte de Meneses, son of D. Pedro, adopted a more aggressive military policy, using tactics like feigned retreats . D. Pedro de Meneses died in Ceuta during the disastrous expedition to Tangiers in 1437 . Portuguese forces attempted to take the castle of Tetuan in 1435 but were repelled . The garrison used naval assets to support land forces, transporting footmen to coastal targets while cavalry moved overland .",

Ceuta's bastion fortifications were built between 1541 and 1549 . In 1541, the plans for the fortress of Ceuta proposed the construction of a wide, deep ditch, also used as a maritime channel, ensuring separation between the town and the mainland . The plans for Ceuta introduced the bastioned model and included an improved system of access from the exterior field and from the sea . Bastions, curtains and repairs on the bastioned land front in Ceuta were carried out by integrating the ancient walls into the new construction . A new system of access from the exterior field was established in Ceuta – a side entry protected against assault from land – leading to a reduction in the defensive perimeter and the demolition of an existing urban area .",
