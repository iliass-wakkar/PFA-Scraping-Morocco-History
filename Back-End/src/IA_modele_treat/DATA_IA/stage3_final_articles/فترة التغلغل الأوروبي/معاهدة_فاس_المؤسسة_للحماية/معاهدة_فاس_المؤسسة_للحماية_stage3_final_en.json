          "text": "The Treaty of Fez (معاهدة فاس), signed on March 30, 1912, between France and Morocco, marked a pivotal moment in Moroccan history, establishing the French Protectorate over the country . This event was the culmination of increasing European influence and internal strife within Morocco . Prior to the treaty, Morocco faced numerous challenges, including a weakened state, internal rebellions, and financial instability . Sultan Hassan I attempted reforms in the late 19th century, but faced resistance . The defeat in the Battle of Isly in 1844 further weakened Morocco and increased European influence . After Hassan I's death, Sultan Abd al-Aziz's reign (1894-1908) was characterized by financial instability and internal rebellions, including the Zerhouni rebellion in 1901 . Moulay Hafid began considering taking over from his brother Abd al-Aziz as early as 1907 and was proclaimed Sultan in Fez on August 15, 1907, under conditions of expelling Europeans .",

France signed various agreements with these powers between 1904 and 1911 to pave the way for its control . The Algeciras Conference in 1906 affirmed the sovereignty of Morocco while opening the door to greater European involvement . The Franco-Spanish Convention of 1904 aimed to balance French and Spanish interests in Morocco . However, the Agadir Crisis in 1911 heightened tensions and accelerated the process leading to the French protectorate . Germany sent a gunboat to Agadir amidst an uprising against Sultan Abdelhafid, prompting France to send troops to Fez . A definite treaty of diplomatic alliance between France and Morocco was concluded in February 1910 .",
