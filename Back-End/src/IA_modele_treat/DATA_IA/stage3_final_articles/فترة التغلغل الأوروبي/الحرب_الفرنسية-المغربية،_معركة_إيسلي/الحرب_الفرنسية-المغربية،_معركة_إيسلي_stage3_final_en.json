In July 1830, a French expeditionary force landed west of Algiers and captured the city, marking the beginning of a long-term occupation of an Arab country by a European power . The conquest was initiated by Charles X to end Muslim privateering and increase his popularity . Following the capture of Algiers, French troops began plundering, arresting, and killing people . Charles X was deposed in July 1830, and Louis-Philippe became the new ruler of France .",
