          "text": "The First Melilla Campaign, also known as the Melilla War or the Gurugú War, took place in 1909 . This conflict was rooted in Spain's long-standing presence in Morocco, dating back to the Middle Ages . By 1911, Spain was the only foreign power with a foothold on Moroccan soil, possessing the cities of Melilla and Ceuta, as well as the island presidios of Penon de Velez de Gomera, the Alhucemas, and the Zaffarines . Melilla, a Spanish territory of 12 km2 located in northeastern Morocco, had been under Spanish sovereignty since 1497 . It initially served as a prison colony for nearly four centuries before its economic and political transformation began in the second half of the 19th century . Melilla was declared a free port in 1863 .",

Mining resources became a priority for Spanish oligarchs, which prompted an economic penetration into a region of Morocco controlled by a series of tribes .",
