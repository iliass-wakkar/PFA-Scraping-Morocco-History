          "text": "The First Barbary War, also known as the Tripolitan War, was a naval conflict fought between the United States and Tripoli (present-day Libya) from 1801 to 1805 . This war marked the first instance of American military power projection across the world . The roots of the conflict lay in the practice of Barbary piracy, where states in North Africa—Morocco, Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli—engaged in attacking merchant vessels in the Mediterranean Sea, seizing their goods, and enslaving their crews . These Barbary pirates, supported by Pashas and Deys, demanded tribute from European and American vessels in exchange for safe passage . European powers, including England and France, often paid annual tribute as a form of 'insurance' .",

The U.S. government, lacking funds to pay tribute or build a navy, initially attempted to negotiate treaties with the Barbary states . In 1786, the U.S. government agreed to pay tribute to the Barbary states to stop attacks on American ships . By 1797, the United States had paid out $1.25 million in tribute . The Naval Act of 1794, passed on March 27, established the first US Navy to combat these attacks and demands for money . The USS Constitution was the first naval vessel to complete construction .",

Jefferson refused the demand, leading the Pasha of Tripoli to declare war against the United States by chopping down the flagstaff in front of the U.S. Consulate in Tripoli on May 10, 1801 .",
