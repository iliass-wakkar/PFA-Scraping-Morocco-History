The crisis was an outgrowth of events extending back to the Congress of Berlin . By the beginning of the 20th century, Morocco was the only independent state in the Maghreb .",

The Madrid Convention of 1880 guaranteed equal economic access to Morocco for all signatory powers . The Entente Cordiale, signed between England and France on April 8, 1904, settled colonial disputes, with France recognizing British occupation of Egypt in exchange for British permission for France to institute reforms in Morocco . Secret articles of the Entente Cordiale contemplated the eventual partitioning of Morocco between France and Spain .",

Henry White was chosen as the principal United States delegate for his diplomatic experience and his sympathy towards the Anglo-French . At the first meeting of the Conference on January 16, 1906, the Duke of Almodovar (Spain) was elected president . By February 7, 1906, there was complete agreement on the matter of tax reforms at the conference . On February 3, Revoil proposed to Von Radowitz that the mandate for the police be shared with Spain as a concession, a French strategy to enlist U.S intervention . On February 4, White expressed support for the Franco-Spanish proposal, stating it met the maximum equity and logic required of France . On February 6, White wrote to Root that France would not yield on the matter of the police . On February 8, Von Radowitz talked with White and Venosta again, proposing that the Sultan have control of the police but with instructors from three secondary powers, a plan White refused to endorse . On February 13, Germany sent a telegram indicating they would rather disrupt the conference than retreat further . From February 14-15, White and Revoil had conversations that resulted in the White-Revoil formula, with the recommendation for Roosevelt to recommend a compromise to the Kaiser . On February 16, White recommended that Germany either accept the French proposals or end the Conference . On March 7, Roosevelt sent a letter to the Kaiser urging acceptance of Roosevelt's recommendations . On March 8, the Austrian delegate proposed a plan to assign French police to certain ports and Spanish police to others, with Casablanca under an Inspector General . On the 14th of March 1906, a French ministerial crisis ended and the Kaiser sent a stronger telegram to Roosevelt denouncing the French . On the 17th of March, Root informed White that The US stood for freedom of commerce and a limited control by France and Spain through a multi-lateral mandate . Roosevelt made a public statement praising Germany and it's leaders on April 12 1906 .",
