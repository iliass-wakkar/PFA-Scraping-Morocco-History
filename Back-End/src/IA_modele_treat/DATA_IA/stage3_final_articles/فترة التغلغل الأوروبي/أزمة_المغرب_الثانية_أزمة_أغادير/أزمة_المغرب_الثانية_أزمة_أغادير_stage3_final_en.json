          "text": "The Agadir Crisis, also known as the Second Moroccan Crisis, occurred in 1911 and exposed the growing tensions between France and Germany, foreshadowing the outbreak of World War I . The crisis stemmed from long-standing imperial rivalries between European powers, particularly France and Germany, over Morocco . Germany's position among the great powers of Europe had endured setbacks since 1890, with Russia becoming an ally of France in 1894 and Great Britain signing an agreement with France in 1904 . In 1907, Russia and Great Britain also came to terms . The Anglo-French Entente of 1904 settled the future of Morocco, with Great Britain agreeing that France might establish a protectorate there . Germany, a signatory of the Madrid Convention of 1880, was not officially notified or consulted about the French protectorate in Morocco . This contributed to Morocco becoming a symbol of Germany's declining prestige .",

German Emperor Wilhelm II visited Tangier on March 31, 1905, asserting support for Moroccan sovereignty and challenging French control . This action stemmed from German concerns about French expansionism and its agreements with Britain and Spain . The crisis escalated as Germany called for an international conference, leading to the Algeciras Conference in 1906, where France's claims were largely upheld, isolating Germany . The Tangier Crisis reinforced the Anglo-French alliance and contributed to the formation of the Triple Entente .",

Vorwärts and L'Humanité published articles and calls related to the Moroccan question during the crisis in 1911 . Jean Jaurès of L'Humanité wrote about the danger and need for sang-froid during the Moroccan crisis in July 1911 .
