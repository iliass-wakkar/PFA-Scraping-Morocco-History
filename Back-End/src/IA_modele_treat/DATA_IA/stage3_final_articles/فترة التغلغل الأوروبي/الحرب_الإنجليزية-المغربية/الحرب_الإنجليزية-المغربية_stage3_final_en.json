          "text": "Anglo-Moroccan relations date back to the 13th century, with an envoy from King John of England seeking military assistance from Sultan Mohamed al-Naṣīr against France . Mercantile and trading opportunities became noticeable around the 16th century . The first known British trading voyages to Morocco occurred in 1551, driven by interest in gold, saltpetre, and sugar . James Aldy's account of this voyage provides insight into early British experiences in Barbary . England and Morocco found common ground against Spain, with Morocco providing saltpetre for English gunpowder in exchange for arms . Elizabeth I chartered the Barbary Company in Morocco, which produced crucial economic and political benefits for England . The Barbary Company was formed in 1585 under the Earl of Leicester to foster trade relations . In 1583, Lord Burghley advised Queen Elizabeth on the suitability of an alliance with Morocco .",

Elizabeth I engaged in diplomatic relations with the Barbary states, particularly Morocco, selling arms and supplies in exchange for sugar . The alliance grew stronger under Aḥmed al-Manṣūr, particularly after the defeat of the Portuguese in 1578 at the Battle of Alcazar . This alliance granted England unprecedented protectionist privileges at sea, while Morocco gained substantial power and diplomatic recognition . England’s victory over the Spanish Armada in 1588 changed al-Mansur’s impression of Elizabeth and prompted him to propose a joint attack against Spain . Drake's expedition against Lisbon in 1589 was planned with the expectation of Moroccan support, which ultimately did not materialize . Moroccan ships possibly aided the English at Cadiz in 1596, according to intelligence from the Fugger merchants . In 1596, Elizabeth’s ships and soldiers, along with ships and supplies from al-Mansur, were victorious in their attack on Cadiz . Morocco provided logistical assistance to the English attack on Cadiz in 1596 .",
