          "text": "The Spanish-Moroccan War, also known as the War of Tetouan (الحرب الإسبانية-المغربية حرب تطوان), erupted in 1859, rooted in a complex history of Spanish-North African relations and Spain's desire to assert its influence in the region . Centuries of Christian-Muslim contact had left a cultural legacy in Spain, but also contributed to perceptions of Spain as backward . Spain's declaration of war in October 1859 was partly motivated by a desire to emulate the influence of France and Great Britain in Africa . Some in Spain saw the war as a new colonial project during a time of imperial collapse, offering a chance to vindicate Spain's perceived derision by north-western European powers and providing a sense of unity during a period of socio-political disunity .",

The Anyera tribe destroyed a boundary stone, leading to Spain's declaration of war on October 22, 1859 . This incident served as a pretext for Spain to pursue its broader colonial ambitions . The Spanish government, led by Leopoldo O'Donnell, sought to use a military victory to strengthen national sentiment and quell internal political instability .",

Morocco struggled to make the indemnity payments, leading to increased taxes, a loan from Great Britain, and eventually Spanish control of customs revenues in several Moroccan cities from 1862 to 1884 .
