          "text": "The phrase \"صراعات سلالية بعد وفاة إسماعيل\" translates to \"Dynastic Conflicts Following the Death of Ismail.\" This article synthesizes information from various sources to explore instances of succession struggles and internal power conflicts that occurred after the death of rulers named Ismail in different historical contexts. These include, but are not limited to, the Alaouite dynasty in Morocco after the death of Moulay Ismail in 1727 , the Safavid dynasty after the death of Shah Ismail I in 1524 , and the rule of Khedive Ismail of Egypt, whose deposition in 1879 led to political instability . The article also examines succession issues in other dynasties, such as the Ptolemaic dynasty in Egypt , the Al Sabah dynasty in Kuwait , and the Nasrid dynasty of Granada , to provide a broader understanding of the dynamics of dynastic conflicts.",

This period, lasting until 1757, was marked by numerous contenders vying for the throne . The possession of dynastic emblems, such as the sultan's parasol, horses, saddles, javelots, and lances, became crucial for establishing royal legitimacy .

These conflicts often arise from uncertainties in succession, power struggles between different branches of the family, and external pressures from other powers . The examples of Morocco after Moulay Ismail's death, the Safavid dynasty after Ismail I's death, and Egypt after Khedive Ismail's deposition illustrate the diverse ways in which these conflicts can manifest and the significant impact they can have on the stability and development of a region .
