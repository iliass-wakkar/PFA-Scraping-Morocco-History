          "text": "Mazagan, now known as El Jadida, was founded by King Emmanuel of Portugal in 1514 . The toponym 'Mazagan' is possibly of Berber origin, with forms such as 'Mazighan' appearing in texts from the 11th and 12th centuries . Duarte Pacheco Pereira described Mazagan around the beginning of the 16th century, noting the location of a destroyed city . In the summer of 1514, construction of the castle of Mazagan accelerated under Portuguese military protection . Some strategists questioned the need for a fortress at Mazagan given the fortress being built at Azamor . Mazagan began as a small protectorate of the Portuguese crown in 1486 . After the conquest of Azamor in 1513, King Manuel I ordered the transformation of Mazagan into a bastioned fortress to protect the Carreira da Índia . In 1541, Mazagan was transformed into a grand fortress city, considered the first 'ideal city' of the Renaissance built outside of Europe .",

          "text": "Around 1540, the building of the bastioned fortress of Mazagan in North Africa marked a turning point in Portuguese fortification . The hiring of an Italian engineer played a major role in the construction of the Mazagan fortress . The experimental process and knowledge transfer involved in the construction of Mazagan went beyond a simple technical delivery from the center to the periphery . In 1541, Benedetto da Ravenna inspected Portuguese cities in Morocco, including Septa, Tangier, and Mazagan . Benedetto da Ravenna's plan for Mazagan is considered the first perfect European bulwarked fortification . In 1541, Benedetto da Ravenna and Miguel de Arruda visited Mazagão to modernise the fortifications . Francisco de Holanda drew the initial model for the fortifications at Mazagão applying the bastion system, though he never visited Mazagão himself . The construction of angled bastions in Mazagão started in 1541, potentially impacting discussions on fort design .",
