          "text": "The French presence in Morocco intensified in the early 20th century, marked by increasing disorder and intervention . The Conference of Algeciras (January 16 to April 7, 1906) strengthened France's economic and military position in Morocco . However, internal unrest persisted, leading to the Treaty of Fez on March 30, 1912, which established the French Protectorate . This protectorate granted France administrative, political, and military control over Morocco . The actual conquest and pacification of the country took twenty-two years after the signing of the treaty . Even before the formal establishment of the protectorate, tensions were rising. The murder of Dr. Émile Mauchamp in Marrakech on March 19, 1907, served as a pretext for French military action . Hubert Lyautey used this event as justification for the French occupation of Oujda, a significant step in establishing the protectorate .",

          "text": "On July 30, 1907, nine Europeans were massacred in Casablanca, precipitating the French decision to occupy the city . This massacre prompted the French government to send the warship 'Galilée' to protect the French consulate and French nationals . On August 5, 1907, the 'Galilée' landed a small troop of 66 men, who faced gunfire at the Porte de la Marine . This landing led to fighting and the subsequent bombardment of Casablanca . The decision to bombard the city was met with criticism from other powers and members of the French parliament . A French expeditionary force was concentrated at Oran and escorted to Casablanca by warships . The expeditionary force, consisting of 2,000 men under General Drude, landed in Casablanca on August 7, 1907, at noon, replacing the marines . The VI/1er RE (Foreign Legion) also landed on August 7 to defend against attacks from the Chaouia tribes . The French bombardment of Casablanca is depicted in the postcard 'La France au Maroc', showing the carnage .",

The French occupation of Morocco, including Casablanca, was interrupted by World War I (1914-1918) but resumed methodically in 1920 . The French faced resistance in various regions, including the Middle Atlas, south of the Grand Atlas, and the region of Taza . Casablanca served as a base to subdue the Chaouia tribes . The French colonial administration introduced modern public health measures and work discipline . Colonial settings, like Morocco, were used to experiment with welfare society norms before they were implemented in France . French urban planning in Morocco during the colonial period involved two approaches: \"techno-cosmopolitanism\" and \"middling modernism\" . \"Techno-cosmopolitanism\" aimed to integrate general planning principles with specific cultural and social contexts, operationalizing history, society, and culture . Modernization under French colonialism involved identifying and operationalizing Moroccan tradition to achieve health, productivity, and efficiency .",

The support of the United States and the United Kingdom for Moroccan independence angered French authorities . In 1945, a famine occurred in Morocco, for which the French did nothing, while the Americans offered food aid . Muhammad V praised the American government in Tangier, ignoring praise to the French government, in the presence of French officials . France exiled Muhammad V in 1952, causing the citizens of Morocco to associate their nationalism with Muhammad V’s exile . France restored Muhammad V to the throne after facing public disapproval and a revolution in Morocco . In 1955, Muhammad V met with the French Foreign Minister in Paris and declared the end of a “minor jihad” to gain independence .",
