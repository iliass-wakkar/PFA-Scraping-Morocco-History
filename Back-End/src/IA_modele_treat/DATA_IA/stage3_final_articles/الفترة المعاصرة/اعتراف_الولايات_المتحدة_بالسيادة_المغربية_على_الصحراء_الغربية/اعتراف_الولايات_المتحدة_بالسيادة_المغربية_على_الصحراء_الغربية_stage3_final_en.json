          "text": "The Western Sahara is a disputed territory with a complex history. Colonized by Spain in the 19th century, both Morocco and Mauritania sought territorial gains in Western Sahara in 1971 . The indigenous Sahrawis, represented by the Polisario Front (PF), resisted these claims . The Polisario Front was formed in 1973 in Mauritania to fight for the independence of Western Sahara, initially against Spain and later against Morocco and Mauritania . In 1975, the UN International Court of Justice declared the Sahrawi people's right to self-determination over Western Sahara . In October 1975, the International Court of Justice ruled that self-determination was incompatible with Morocco's historical claims . In November 1975, King Hasan II ordered 300,000 Moroccans to march into Western Sahara in what became known as 'the Green March' . Spain withdrew from Western Sahara in 1976 without holding a referendum, deferring sovereignty to Morocco and Mauritania .",

Thousands of Sahrawi people fled to the Tindouf area of Algeria in 1976 and have resided in refugee camps there for nearly 40 years . Algeria has financially, militarily, and diplomatically supported the Polisario Front . Mauritania renounced its territorial claims in 1979, ceding territory to Morocco . Morocco built a 2700-kilometer Berm wall, manned by over 100,000 soldiers, on territory it controls . A settlement agreement was signed in 1991, envisaging a referendum on Sahrawi self-determination . The United Nations mission for the referendum on Western Sahara (MINURSO) was created . The referendum, originally envisaged for 1992, has not been instituted due to disagreements over voter eligibility . The UN views Western Sahara as a non-decolonized territory, not granting full sovereignty to Morocco but not explicitly legitimizing the SADR .",

Morocco rejoined the African Union (AU) on January 30, 2017, after leaving in 1984 . Morocco's accession strategy involved numerous visits to francophone allies, economic agreements, and upgrading ties with Nigeria, South Africa, and Kenya . A key component of Morocco's strategy was to no longer make accession contingent on the de-recognition of the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) . Morocco believes the civil war in South Sudan has divided the independence drive among African states . Morocco believes counter-terrorism cooperation will ensure closer ties with the kingdom . Morocco believes low oil prices and leadership transition in Algeria will impair its support for the Polisario Front (PF) . Morocco believes its 2007 autonomy plan will soon be recognized as an optimal solution for the Western Sahara conflict . Morocco launched an autonomy initiative for Western Sahara in 2007 . The Moroccan initiative for Sahara autonomy was presented to the UN Secretary-General on April 11, 2007 . The Moroccan autonomy plan offers Sahrawi populations internal self-determination through free management of political, economic, social, and cultural affairs . The Moroccan plan excludes external self-determination to preserve Morocco's territorial integrity and national sovereignty . Rabat intends to retain exclusive powers in defense and external relations under the autonomy initiative . The autonomy statute is planned to be submitted to a referendum for the concerned populations .",

MINURSO has been trying to persuade Morocco to allow a referendum to be held . MINURSO does not have a mandate to investigate or monitor matters of Human Rights . The Moroccan government has lobbied for the Security Council to keep the MINURSO mandate as it is . The US and France are mentioned as already being in favor of Morocco's 2007 autonomy plan . The US has historically been ambivalent towards the Maghreb, but post-9/11, Morocco's cooperation in the GWOT led to a Free Trade Agreement in 2004 . In April 2007, the US supported Morocco's proposal to give the Western Sahara \"meaningful autonomy\" under Moroccan sovereignty, despite it lacking a referendum, seemingly contradicting the US position on self-determination . The US has communicated to Morocco that the free trade agreement does not include the Western Sahara . In 2006, Gordon Gray, Under-Secretary for the Middle East and Maghreb Affairs, stated the US continues to seek a political solution acceptable to both Moroccans and Sahrawis within the UN framework and has no desire to impose a solution . The US encouraged Morocco to present a plan for autonomy of the Western Sahara .",

Twenty-eight states have formally advocated for the SADR's suspension from the AU . South Africa and Algeria continue to support the PF and SADR . Norway has adopted a strong stance against Morocco, advising its private actors not to get involved in Western Sahara, known as a policy of dissuasion . Only two other countries, the Netherlands and Denmark, in addition to Norway practice this policy of dissuasion . Sweden has taken a more ambiguous position, deciding in 2016 not to recognize the SADR .",

On December 10, 2020, President Trump decided to recognize Morocco’s sovereignty over Western Sahara in exchange for Morocco’s recognition of the State of Israel . The US recognition was in exchange for Morocco re-establishing diplomatic ties with Israel . The Trump administration managed to impose the signing of agreements between several Arab countries and Israel . As a gesture to obtain these agreements, the American administration granted the recognition of Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara . In January 2020, the Israeli government offered to help Morocco obtain American recognition of Moroccan sovereignty over the occupied Western Sahara in exchange for Morocco's formal normalization of relations with Israel and support for Donald Trump's \"deal of the century\" . This arrangement was made public in December .",
