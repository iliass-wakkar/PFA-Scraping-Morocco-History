          "text": "The dispute over Western Sahara dates back to 1975, when Spain relinquished its colonial control over the territory, previously known as Spanish Sahara . Morocco subsequently annexed the region, a move contested by the Polisario Front, which, backed by Algeria, claims the territory and established the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) in 1976 . The Polisario Front seeks self-determination for the Sahrawi people . The conflict is a key aspect of the rivalry between Algeria and Morocco . Algeria supports the Polisario, hoping for a friendly state that provides an Atlantic outlet for exports . Morocco views Western Sahara as a natural and historical extension of its territory, seeking revenue from its phosphate and fish reserves .",

The UN established the MINURSO (United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara) to monitor the ceasefire and organize a referendum . However, the referendum process was plagued by disputes over voter eligibility, with Morocco controlling voter registration and determining which Sahrawis could register . Former U.S. Ambassador Frank Ruddy, who served as Deputy Chairman of MINURSO, criticized the UN's handling of the referendum process, accusing Morocco of controlling the process and preventing a fair vote .",

The plan proposed autonomous rule under Moroccan supervision . Article 6 of Morocco's autonomy plan reserves powers in defense, external relations, and constitutional/religious prerogatives for the King of Morocco .",
