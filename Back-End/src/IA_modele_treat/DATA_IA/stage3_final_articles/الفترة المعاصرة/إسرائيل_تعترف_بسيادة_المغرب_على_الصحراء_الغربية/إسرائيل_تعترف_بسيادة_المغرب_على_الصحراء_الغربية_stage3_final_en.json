          "text": "The recognition by Israel of Moroccan sovereignty over the Western Sahara in July 2023 represents a significant development in the complex geopolitical landscape of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region . This event is deeply intertwined with the Abraham Accords, a series of normalization agreements brokered by the United States in 2020 between Israel and several Arab states, including the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan, and Morocco . The Abraham Accords aimed to foster peace, security, and prosperity in the Middle East . However, they have also been criticized for potentially undermining the Arab Peace Initiative and sidelining the Palestinian issue .",

Despite the absence of official diplomatic relations between 2000 and 2020, unofficial ties persisted, particularly in areas such as tourism and security . Approximately one million Moroccan Jews reside in Israel , and tens of thousands of Israelis visit Morocco annually . Secret relationships between Israel and Morocco existed from the 1950s to the 1970s, focusing on economic aid and Jewish emigration . King Hassan II engaged in discreet meetings with Israeli leaders, aiming to play a mediating role in Arab-Israeli relations . Liaison offices were exchanged in 1994 but closed in 2000 during the Second Intifada .",

The US also pledged to open a consulate in Dakhla, a city in the Western Sahara, to promote economic and business opportunities . The US reaffirmed its support for Morocco's autonomy proposal as the only basis for a just and lasting solution to the Western Sahara dispute .",

The Biden administration has not reversed the Trump administration's recognition , but some US political representatives criticize the decision . The potential for a reversal of US policy remains a possibility . The ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas has also tested the strength of the normalization agreements . The normalization process may slow down or freeze if the war continues and the humanitarian consequences worsen . However, Morocco is unlikely to completely cut ties with Israel due to existing agreements and interests . The future of the Western Sahara dispute and the role of Israel in the region will continue to be shaped by complex and evolving geopolitical dynamics .",
