Baker 3d, embarked on a series of diplomatic initiatives aimed at resolving the long-standing Arab-Israeli conflict . These efforts gained momentum following the Gulf War, with the Bush administration seeking to leverage its influence in the region to foster a lasting peace . Baker's approach involved intense shuttle diplomacy, engaging with leaders from Israel, Palestine, Syria, Egypt, and Jordan . The goal was to initiate direct negotiations between Israel and its Arab neighbors, as well as between Israel and the Palestinians .",

US 'letters of assurance' to Syria referred to the principle of restitution of the Golan and understanding of Arab grievances like the annexation of Jerusalem-East and settlements . US 'letters of assurance' to Lebanon addressed the implementation of Resolution 425 regarding Southern Lebanon .",

On September 12, 1991, George Bush threatened to veto aid to Israel if Congress approved it, citing pressure from a 'powerful lobby' .
