          "text": "The Western Sahara conflict stems from the incomplete decolonization of the former Spanish colony . Spain colonized the territory in 1884, specifically the Rio de Oro peninsula . In 1961, Spain became the administrator under Chapter XI of the UN Charter, recognizing the right to self-determination of the inhabitants through a referendum . However, Morocco and Mauritania contested this position, claiming pre-existing legal links to the territories before Spanish colonization . The International Court of Justice (ICJ) considered the legal status of Western Sahara, specifically whether it was a *terra nullius* at the time of Spanish colonization . The ICJ found legal links of allegiance between the Sultan of Morocco and certain tribes in Western Sahara, but deemed these insufficient to establish territorial sovereignty .",

Spain transferred the administration, but not the sovereignty, of the Sahara to Morocco and Mauritania . The UN acknowledged the Madrid Accords (resolution 345 B of December 10, 1975) but also called for the Sahrawis' right to self-determination (resolution 345 A of the same date) . The Madrid Agreement proposed an exploitation scheme for the phosphate deposits with 65% participation by Morocco and 35% by Spain .",
