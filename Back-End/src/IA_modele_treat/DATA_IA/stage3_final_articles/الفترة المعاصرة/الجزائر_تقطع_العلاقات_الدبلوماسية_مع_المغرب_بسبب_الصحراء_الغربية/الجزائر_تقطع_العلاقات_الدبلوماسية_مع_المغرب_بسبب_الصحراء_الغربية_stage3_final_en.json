A key point of contention is the issue of Western Sahara, with Algeria supporting the POLISARIO Front, which seeks independence for the territory, while Morocco claims sovereignty . This support has been a major source of friction between the two nations . The roots of their rivalry can be traced back to border disputes following Algeria's independence, including the Sands War in October 1963 .",

However, the AMU has been effectively moribund due to the ongoing conflict in Western Sahara and the rivalry between Algeria and Morocco for regional hegemony .",
