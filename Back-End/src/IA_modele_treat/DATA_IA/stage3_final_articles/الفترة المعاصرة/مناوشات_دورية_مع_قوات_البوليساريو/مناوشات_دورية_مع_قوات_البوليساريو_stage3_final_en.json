          "text": "The conflict in the Western Sahara stems from the region's colonial history and competing claims of sovereignty . From 1912 to 1956, Morocco was divided into French and Spanish protectorates, as well as the international zone of Tangiers . All protectorate arrangements were terminated in 1956 . In 1973, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Saguia el-Hamra and Rio de Oro (Polisario Front) was formed, seeking independence for the Spanish Sahara . The development of a phosphate industry in the region laid the basis for a modern nationalist movement, with the Polisario Front pursuing an independent nation-state . The increased awareness among Saharawis about the prospect of an economically viable country due to phosphate resources contributed to mobilizing armed resistance against Moroccan control .",

Qaddafi's support was driven by his sympathy for revolutionary movements and his opposition to monarchical Morocco . He aimed to aid revolutionary groups against established monarchies and anyone who opposed Israel . Qaddafi saw Israel's destruction as a catalyst for Arab and Muslim unity . Libya opened offices in Tripoli for various organizations, including the Polisario .",

          "text": "The Polisario Front engaged in both violent and non-violent resistance against Morocco . Sahrawi youth, frustrated with the Polisario Front's perceived 'do-nothing policy,' increasingly considered armed resistance as a solution to the conflict . Dudouet's theories of armed resistance resonated with these youth . The Polisario threatened to resume hostilities with Morocco if it did not cease building a road connecting Morocco to Senegal through the buffer zone in 2016 . Both Morocco and the Polisario mobilized forces to their sides of the ceasefire line until Morocco withdrew in February 2017 and the Polisario did likewise in April 2017 . Morocco launched an offensive against the Polisario in the Polisario-controlled Western Sahara (SADR) in late August to early September 1991, targeting Tifariti and Bir Lahlou before the ceasefire officially came into effect . In 2020, Morocco launched an operation in the Western Sahara border zone against the Polisario Front .",

MINURSO's long-term aim was to hold a self-determination referendum . However, MINURSO is regarded as a failure by some because it was unable to hold this referendum . The US officially encourages mediation of the Western Sahara conflict but supports Morocco's \"legitimate self-defense requirements\" in the contested area . The US aimed to maintain close relations with Morocco . Tensions between the UN and Morocco were amplified by Morocco’s plan to build a road connecting Morocco to Senegal through the 'buffer zone' established in 1991 to maintain the ceasefire . Morocco demanded the United Nations (UN) to withdraw all its civilian personnel from Western Sahara within 72 hours in March 2016 after UNSG Ban Ki Moon described the situation in Western Sahara as an ‘occupation’ .",

Mauritania earmarked 25 percent of its budget for the military in 1980 and 1981 due to concerns about the war in the Western Sahara . In 1996, Mauritania feared that the region bordering the Western Sahara would become a theater of military confrontations between Morocco and the Polisario Front . There were unconfirmed reports of clashes between Mauritanian troops guarding the border and Sahrawi troops violating it in 1996 . Mauritania desired to maintain neutrality in the conflict between Morocco and Algeria regarding the Western Sahara .",
