The Moroccan Army of Liberation was created to achieve independence and restore Sultan Muhammad bin Yusuf to the throne after his exile . The official establishment of the Moroccan Liberation Army was in Madrid in 1955 . Training bases were located in the northern region, and the army maintained close ties to the Istiqlal Party .",

The Algerian Revolution was triggered by young activists within the التيار الثوري of the الحركة الوطنية الجزائرية after the المنظمة الخاصة (L’os) was dismantled by French police in March 1954 . The decision for armed struggle followed the internal crisis within the الحركة الوطنية (حزب الشعب الجزائري - حركة انتصار الحريات الديمقراطية PPA-MTLD) during its second congress in April 1953 . The Moroccan Liberation Army coordinated with other liberation armies in Algeria and Tunisia .",

Abd al-Krim al-Khattabi, a prominent figure in Moroccan history, urged continued resistance in the Rif region even after the Franco-Moroccan declaration of March 2, 1956, which recognized Morocco's independence . He warned guerrilla fighters not to trust promises and to continue armed struggle as long as any French presence remained in Morocco . This contrasted with Sultan Muhammad V's call for a ceasefire to allow independence negotiations to conclude . This created a conflict in authority within the Moroccan Army of Liberation .",
