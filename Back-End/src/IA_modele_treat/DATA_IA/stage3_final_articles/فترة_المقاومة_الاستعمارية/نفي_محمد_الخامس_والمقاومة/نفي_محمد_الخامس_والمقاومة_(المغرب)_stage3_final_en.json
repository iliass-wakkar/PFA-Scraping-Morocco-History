While the Sultan remained, the French Résident Général acted as the sole intermediary between the monarch and foreign representatives . This system, along with the Spanish Protectorate in the northern Rif region and parts of the south, sparked growing nationalist sentiment among Moroccans . Sidi Mohammed, later known as Mohammed V, became Sultan in 1927 and emerged as a symbol of this nationalist movement .",

The \"Berber Dahir\" of 1930, which aimed to implement customary law in Berber-speaking regions, triggered widespread protests . The nationalist party Istiqlal (Independence) was founded in 1944 and played a central role in the fight for independence . During World War II, Mohammed V sided with the Allies and implicitly supported the Istiqlal party . His speech in Tangier on April 10, 1947, deviated from the approved text, further straining relations with the French . General Alphonse Juin aimed to force the sultan \"to submit or resign\" . Thami El Glaoui, Pacha of Marrakech, was used to oppose Mohammed V .",
