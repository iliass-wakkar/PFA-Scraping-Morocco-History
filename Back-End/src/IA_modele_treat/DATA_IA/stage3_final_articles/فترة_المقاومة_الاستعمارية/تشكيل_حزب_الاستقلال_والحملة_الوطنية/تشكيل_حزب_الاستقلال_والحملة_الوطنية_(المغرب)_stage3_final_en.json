          "text": "In the early 20th century, Morocco was subjected to increasing European influence, culminating in the Treaty of Fez on March 30, 1912, which established a Franco-Spanish protectorate . This treaty divided Morocco into zones of influence, with France controlling the majority of the territory and Spain administering the northern and southern regions . The Algeciras Conference of 1906 had already recognized the rights of both Spain and France to exert influence in Morocco . The establishment of the protectorate, however, did not occur without resistance. The Berber tribes, in particular, mounted a strong opposition, besieging French forces in Fez in April 1912 . The Rif War (1921-1926), led by Abd el-Krim al-Khattabi, further demonstrated the strength of Moroccan resistance to colonial rule .",

          "text": "Despite the imposition of the protectorate, a sense of Moroccan national identity began to coalesce. This was fueled by several factors, including the influence of European ideologies, the growth of an educated elite, and the desire to preserve Moroccan culture and traditions . The Berber Dahir of 1930, which aimed to regulate Berber customary law and remove Berber tribes from Muslim law, sparked widespread protests and is often seen as a key turning point in the development of Moroccan nationalism . The Comité d’Action Marocaine (CAM), created in 1934, emerged as the first overtly nationalist party, advocating for reforms and a stricter application of the Protectorate regime . The CAM, led by figures like Allal al-Fasi, Mohamed Bel Hassan El Ouazzani, and Ahmed Balafrej, sought to abolish direct administration practices . However, the French authorities dissolved the CAM, and internal divisions led to its fragmentation .",

The manifesto, signed by prominent nationalist leaders, demanded full freedom for Morocco under Sultan Muhammad Ben Yussuf (Muhamad V) . The Istiqlal Party aimed to establish a British-style monarchy in Morocco where the sovereign reigns but does not rule .

Initially, the Sultan had signed a dahir forbidding Moroccans from forming unions, viewing them as a threat to the Makhzen's authority . However, after the war, the Sultan began to express support for the nationalist cause . A pivotal moment occurred in April 1947 when Muhammed Ibn Yusuf visited Tanger, demonstrating the unity of Morocco and demanding independence . In his speech of April 9, 1947, in Tanger, the Sultan expressed his regret for the backwardness of the country and encouraged his compatriots to learn modern techniques, expressing confidence in their political awakening and the reclaiming of their rights . The Sultan's Tanger speech in 1947 is considered a milestone, marking his explicit joining of the forces struggling for national development and freedom .",

The Istiqlal opened the Moroccan Informational Bureau in New York at the end of 1947 .
