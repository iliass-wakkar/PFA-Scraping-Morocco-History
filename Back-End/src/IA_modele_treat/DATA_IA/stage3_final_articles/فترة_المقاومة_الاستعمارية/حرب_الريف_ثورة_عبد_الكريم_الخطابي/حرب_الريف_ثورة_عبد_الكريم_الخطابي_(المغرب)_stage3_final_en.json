          "text": "The Rif War (1921-1926), also known as the Revolution of Abd el-Krim al-Khattabi, was a conflict between the Rif people of Morocco and the colonial powers of Spain and France . The Entente Cordiale of 1904 granted France freedom to act in Morocco, with the Rif region reserved for Spain . Morocco's history with Spain included memories of Al-Andalus and Spanish occupation after the Reconquista, with cities like Ceuta and Melilla serving as key locations . The Treaty of Protectorate, signed on March 30, 1912, with Sultan Moulay Hafid, formalized the division of Morocco, granting France the 'Maroc utile' and Spain control over the mountainous Rif region bordering the Mediterranean Sea . The Rif region was targeted for its mineral resources by industrialists in the late 19th century . Spain had maintained a network of informants and agents in northern Morocco since the 17th century .",

Initially, Abdelkrim supported Spanish involvement in the Rif, believing it could lead to economic development and modernization . He even contributed to spreading the Spanish position through chronicles written in Arabic for *El Telegrama del Rif*, a Spanish newspaper founded in Melilla in 1902, aimed at promoting Spanish colonial action and the work of the Spanish military in Morocco . Abdelkrim's family had ties to the 'Partido español' and benefited from privileges as collaborators with the Spanish colonial enterprise . He criticized French colonial policies for exploiting the Moroccan economy . However, after World War I, Abdelkrim began to advocate for Rif independence and aligned with the Central Powers, leading to his arrest by the Spanish for treason .",

In September 1922, the Riff Committee of London sent two documents to the Council of the League of Nations, signed by Abdel Krim as \"president and commander in chief of the Republic of the Rif\" . Abdel Krim claimed his commitment to protect the rights of foreigners and govern in the interest of peace and international commerce . He also denounced the violence perpetrated by the Spanish, including the use of chemical weapons and destruction of sacred Islamic sites . Abdel Krim expressed willingness to negotiate an agreement with Madrid that would preserve the interests of the Spanish Monarchy in Morocco and the right to the existence of the Republic of the Rif .",
