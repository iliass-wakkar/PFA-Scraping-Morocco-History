Spain, seeking to regain international prestige after its defeat in 1898 and the loss of Cuba, the Philippines, and Puerto Rico, aimed to participate in the colonization of Morocco . Spain's foreign policy prioritized the security of its national territory . However, Spain's ambitions were challenged by other European powers, particularly France, which sought to establish a dominant presence in the region . Great Britain also sought to prevent French dominance near the Strait of Gibraltar .",
