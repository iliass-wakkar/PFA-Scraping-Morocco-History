          "text": "In the early 20th century, Morocco was a land of diverse cultures and languages, including Arabic and Berber (also known as Amazigh) . The Alawite dynasty theoretically united the country, but in practice, Morocco consisted of numerous small, independent states . The Sultan's authority was largely confined to cities and major routes, with religious fiefdoms, temporal principalities, and Berber republics also existing . The French Protectorate was established in 1912 through the Treaty of Fez, placing Morocco under French control while ceding a coastal area along the Strait of Gibraltar to Spain . This treaty allowed France to occupy parts of Morocco under the guise of protecting the sovereign . The French Resident-General gained the sole right to represent Morocco in foreign countries .",

The Dahir divided the French Protectorate into zones governed by Sharia law and Berber customary law . It aimed to adapt Berber justice to modern conditions, following the spirit of the Dahir of September 11, 1914, signed by Lyautey . The policy sought to preserve Berber autonomy, especially in legal matters, by keeping them outside Islamic law (Chrâa) and maintaining their customary law (Orf or Izref) . The administration was tasked with defining Berber laws and designating Berber tribes, primarily based on submission to military authorities .",
