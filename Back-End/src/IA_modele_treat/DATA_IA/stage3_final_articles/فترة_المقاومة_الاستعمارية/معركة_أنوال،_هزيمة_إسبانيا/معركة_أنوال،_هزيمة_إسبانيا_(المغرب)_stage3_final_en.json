          "text": "The Battle of Annual, a major military defeat for Spain in Morocco, took place in July 1921 in the Rif region of northern Morocco . This battle was a significant event in the Rif War (1921-1927), a conflict between the Spanish army and the Rif rebels led by Abd el-Krim . Spain's presence in Morocco was rooted in a desire to reclaim national honor after losing its American colonies in 1898 and to reintegrate into international alliances . European powers feared a Spanish agreement with another nation would threaten French sea routes and British control of Gibraltar . The Entente Cordiale of 1904 between Britain and France allocated a sphere of influence to Spain in northern Morocco . The Conference of Algeciras in 1906 stipulated that Morocco should be open to international trade and guaranteed the Sultan's sovereignty, tasking France and Spain with maintaining order in their spheres . The Treaty of Fez in 1912 formally established the Spanish Protectorate in Morocco .",

Approximately 2,500 Spanish soldiers died in four hours during the retreat from Annual, in addition to another 1,500 from other positions . Approximately 492 Spanish soldiers were taken prisoner at Annual . The forces retreating from Annual fell back to Dar Drius and later to Monte Arruit, where they were besieged . General Navarro surrendered Monte Arruit on August 9, 1921, and almost all of the 3,000 soldiers were massacred by Abd el-Krim's forces .

The Spanish army suffered from technical insufficiencies, a diffuse command structure, and a lack of adequate training . The Reglamento Táctico de Infantería de 1914, based on Prussian military thought, was inadequate for irregular warfare against Abd el-Krim's forces . The overextension of General Silvestre's troops and the lack of a suitable military doctrine for counter-insurgency warfare also played a role . The location of the Spanish outposts was based more on political considerations than on military strategy .

The defeat also contributed to a sentiment in Spain that Morocco was a burden . General Juan Picasso was ordered to prepare a report (Expediente Picasso) on the events at Annual, which highlighted multiple military errors and negligence . The Expediente Picasso stated that 13,363 men died (10,973 Spaniards and 2,390 indigenous) compared to 1,000 Riffians . The Picasso investigation revealed corruption and incompetence within the Spanish army .",
