          "text": "The Songhay Empire flourished in West Africa, expanding its territory and trade, developing a strong military and government, and supporting learning and scholarship . It arose from the remains of the Mali Empire under Sonni Ali around 1464 . Gao served as the capital of the Songhay Sultanate . Sonni Ali Ber (1464-1492) and Askia Muhammad (1492-1539) oversaw a period of rapid expansion . Askia Muhammad initiated a golden age of peace and stability . Gao, Timbuktu, and Djenné were important administrative, scholarly, and trade centers . Timbuktu became prominent in the Sudan and known in the Muslim world, producing scholars . The Songhay territory included the Niger bend from Kebbi to Djenné, extending to the Teghâza mines and controlling the gold trade to North Africa . Askia Muhammad I made a pilgrimage to Mecca in 1496-1497 and was declared Caliph of Sudan . He expanded the Songhay Empire to its greatest extent, from Dendi to Sibiridugu and from Teghazza to the border of Yatenga . Askia Dawud (1549-1583) oversaw a period of economic and intellectual flourishing .",

Askia Muhammad renewed ties with the Nile Valley and Hejaz after being invested by the Abbasid caliph in Cairo during his pilgrimage to Mecca . However, internal disarray among Askia Muhammad's descendants weakened the Songhay state in the late 16th century . Internal conflicts and rebellions further weakened the empire . Askia Muḥammad IV Bâno's accession in 1586 led to civil war . Al-Saddīḳ, the balama of Timbuktu, revolted against Askia Muḥammad IV in 1588 but was defeated by Isḥāḳ II . Many Songhay princes allied with the Moroccan invaders in 1591 due to dissatisfaction with Gao .",

          "text": "Religious, political, and economic factors motivated Ahmad al-Mansur's expansion towards the Songhay Empire . The decline of trans-Saharan trade due to the great discoveries and Ottoman expansion in North Africa negatively affected the Moroccan economy . Since the 16th century, the Sharifian dynasty in Morocco attempted to revive the trans-Saharan trade . Sultan Muhammad al-Shaykh al-Mahdî aimed to control the trans-Saharan trade politically and militarily . Control of the salt mines in Taghaza and the gold mines in Ghana was desired to monopolize the trade of salt, gold, and slaves . Seizing the Songhay Empire was considered necessary to dominate the trans-Saharan trade . The Moroccan sultan Mulay Ahmed al-Mansur claimed ownership of the Teghazza salt mines . The salt mines of Teghazza were a source of conflict between the Songhay Empire and the sultans of Morocco . During the reign of Askia Al-Hadj Muḥammad III (1583-1586), a Moroccan expedition occupied the Teghazza mines .",

The Moroccan invasion in 1591 ended the age of the great medieval West African states . The Songhay army in 1591 at the battle of Tondibi numbered approximately 30,000 infantry and 10,000 cavalry . The Moroccan army comprised renegades, Andalusian refugees, and Moroccan soldiers from Dra'a and Fez . The army that conquered the Songhay Sultanate and established a pashalik in Timbuktu in 1591 was largely composed of soldiers from Andalousia and renegades . Andalusian refugees, expelled from Spain between 1492 and 1609, influenced the military power of Morocco through their knowledge of firearms . The expedition of Pasha Djūdar hastened the ruin of trade by ending the largest and most powerful empire in West Sudan by the 16th century .",

The Arma established garrisons between Djenné and Gao and made Tombouctou their capital . The Arma integrated into Songhay society through marriage with the politico-religious elite . The Arma developed a unique political system based on unanimous election and possible revocation of the Pasha, with a rotation of the function between divisions of the army from Marrakech and Fès . In the 1710s, Arma factions introduced multi-story buildings in Timbuktu to better defend against gunfire . After the conquest in 1591, most of the Andalusians and renegades returned to Morocco . Between 1591 and 1618, reinforcements primarily came from Arab-Berber populations in southern Morocco . After 1591, the Songhay ruler and his loyalists fled into the Niger valley . Moroccan authorities tried to prevent refugees from the Songhay empire from receiving assistance . The fall of the Songhay Sultanate in 1591 led to waves of refugees fleeing the Moroccan conquest . The Songhay Empire collapsed due to its internal contradictions following civil war and external pressure from Morocco in 1591 .",
