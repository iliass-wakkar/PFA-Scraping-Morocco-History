          "text": "The Saadian dynasty, claiming descent from the prophet Muhammad, emerged in Morocco in the early 16th century . Unlike previous dynasties such as the Almoravids, Almohads, and Marinids, the Saadians did not rely on *'asabiyya* (esprit de corps) for their rise to power . The Almoravids depended on the Sanhâja confederation, the Almohads on the Masmûda, and the Marinids on the Zanâta confederation . The Saadians originated in the Dra valley, specifically the Zagora region, in the 12th or 13th century . The political and ideological situation in Morocco around 1510 favored their emergence . The Saadians were Arabs, and their rule initiated a political, economic, and intellectual renaissance .",

Sudan sent a tribute of 100,000 pieces of gold and 1,000 slaves to Marrakesh . Sudan also promised an annual *khiraj*/tribute to Morocco . Ahmad al-Mansur was given the epithet *al-Dhahabi* (the golden) due to the large quantities of gold he received .
