          "text": "The history of the Iberian Peninsula is marked by numerous sieges, dating back to ancient times. The sieges of Saguntum (218 BCE) and Numantia (134-133 BCE) stand as legendary national landmarks, representing heroic resistance against invaders . The siege of Saguntum by Hannibal in 219 BC, which escalated into the Second Punic War, and the siege of Numantia by the Roman Empire became symbols of perseverance and heroic defense . The Roman perspective on the siege of Saguntum was often exaggerated for ideological purposes . The Celtiberian settlement of Numantia, near modern Soria, chose suicide and destruction over surrender to Scipio Aemilianus in 133 BCE . This act of defiance has been reinterpreted throughout Spanish history to inspire resistance against foreign powers and promote national unity . Cervantes's play, *La destrucción de la Numancia*, reflects the public's fascination with sieges and stages elements of positional warfare as dramatic tropes .",

The siege of Baza, lasting from mid-June to early December 1489, was one of the most challenging campaigns, employing tactics inspired by Scipio Africanus the Younger's siege of Numantia .",
