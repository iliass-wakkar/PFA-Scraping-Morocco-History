          "text": "The Vandals were an East Germanic people who, along with groups like the Goths, Burgundians, and Rugians, emerged in eastern Germania during the 1st and 2nd centuries AD . Traditional scholarship suggests these groups migrated from prehistoric Scandinavia across the Baltic Sea, settling in continental Europe during the early imperial age . The Vandals underwent a transformation from primarily farmers to a society centered on horse breeding and mounted warfare, heavily influenced by Sarmatians and Alans . This 'Sarmatisation' affected their warfare, economy, dressing, and conduct . By the 5th century, the Vandals had become a major force impacting the Roman world .",

This event is considered a key moment in the decline of the Western Roman Empire . The reasons for this crossing included the westward movement of the Huns, divisions within the Roman Empire, and the desire to escape Hun-generated chaos . The Vandals bypassed Constantine III's armies and crossed the Pyrenees into Spain in 409 AD . By 417, the Visigoths were enlisted to fight against the Vandals and Alans in Spain . In September 409, the Vandals began setting up kingdoms in northern Spain . The Asding and Siling Vandals crossed the frozen Rhine on New Year's Eve 406 .",
