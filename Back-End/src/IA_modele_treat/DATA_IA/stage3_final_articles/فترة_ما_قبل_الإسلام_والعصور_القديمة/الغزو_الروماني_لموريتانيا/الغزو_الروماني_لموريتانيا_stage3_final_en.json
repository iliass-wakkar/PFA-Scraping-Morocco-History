By the mid-2nd century BC, most Mediterranean states were politically tied to Rome, with Mauretania being a notable exception . Initially, Rome's approach to Mauretania mirrored Carthage's, focusing on trade rather than territorial acquisition . The Phoenicians had established trading colonies in North Africa , and Carthage had commercial relations with Numidia and Mauretania . The Mauri lived between the Atlantic coast and the Moulouya River, while the Numidians resided between the Mauri and western Carthaginian territory .",
