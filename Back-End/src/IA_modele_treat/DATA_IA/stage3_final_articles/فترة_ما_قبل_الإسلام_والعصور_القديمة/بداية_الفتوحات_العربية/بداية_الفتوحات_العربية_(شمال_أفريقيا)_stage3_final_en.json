          "text": "The Arab conquests, a significant historical phenomenon, began in the 7th century and led to the formation of a vast empire . This expansion followed the rise of the Prophet Muhammad and the unification of Arabia under Islam . The conquests were not solely religious in nature, although religion played a crucial role . The rise of the Prophet and the existing balance of power between empires influenced the Arab conquests . The traditional date for the death of Prophet Muhammad is 632 CE . Some scholars propose that the conquests began before this date, based on non-Muslim sources .",
