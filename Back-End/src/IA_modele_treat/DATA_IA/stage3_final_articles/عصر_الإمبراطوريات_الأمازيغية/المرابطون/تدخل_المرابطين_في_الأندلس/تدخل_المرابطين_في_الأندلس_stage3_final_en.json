          "text": "Al-Andalus, the area of the Iberian Peninsula under Muslim rule from 711 to 1492, experienced significant political and social changes in the centuries leading up to the Almoravid intervention . The initial Muslim conquest in 711 led to the establishment of Al-Andalus . The Umayyad dynasty ruled Al-Andalus from 756 CE . Cordoba flourished as a cultural center, excelling in science, philosophy, medicine, astronomy, poetry, and history . However, the Caliphate of Cordoba disintegrated after the death of Al-Mansur's son, Abd al-Malik, in 1008, giving rise to the Taifa states by 1031 . These Taifa rulers lacked the unity to effectively resist the Christian kingdoms in the north . Until the early eleventh century, Christian kingdoms in Spain suffered military defeats from Al-Andalus rulers . Al-Mansur (978-1002) led approximately fifty campaigns against the Christian north, sacking Barcelona in 985 and Santiago de Compostela in 997 . The Taifa period saw the end of a unified judicial policy in Al-Andalus . The political fragmentation and weakness in Al-Andalus created the conditions for the later Almoravid intervention .",
