          "text": "The Empire of Ghana, also known as Wagadu, was one of the earliest known political formations in West Africa . Arabic sources began mentioning 'Ghāna,' a ruler and city, in the 9th century due to trans-Saharan trade . The empire was known for its riches in gold and held a preeminent role in the western Sahel . The first mention of the empire of Ghana is found in the works of the astronomer El Fazzari just before 800 A.D. . Arabic writings mention that the Empire of Ghana had existed since the second century A.D. . The empire has been equated with the Soninké people’s legend of Wagadu . David Conrad argues that the Soninké knew the ancient kingdom as Wagadu . The word ‘Ghana’ means ‘king’; the inhabitants of the country were the Sarakole . El Bakri suggests 'Ghana' is a title meaning 'Chief of War' . Some believe the name 'Ghana' is derived from the Arabic adjective 'ghanna', meaning beautiful .",

The inhabitants of these villages were likely Negro and very probably Soninke, with a culture developed largely without external influences . Around 600 B.C., Libyco-Berbers from North Africa arrived in the area . The initial effect of Libyco-Berber contact was the collapse of the existing sociopolitical organization . Subsequent adjustment, along with trans-Saharan trade carried out by North Africans, led to the re-emergence of the pre-existing pattern, resulting in the Ghana Empire . The prehistoric complex suggests a powerful chiefdom with characteristics of subsequent West African states .",
