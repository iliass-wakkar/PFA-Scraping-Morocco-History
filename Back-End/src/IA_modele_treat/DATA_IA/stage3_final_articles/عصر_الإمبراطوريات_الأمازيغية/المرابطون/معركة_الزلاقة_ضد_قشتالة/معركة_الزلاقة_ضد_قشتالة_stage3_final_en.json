          "text": "The Battle of Zallaqa, also known as the Battle of Sagrajas, took place in 1086 in the southwest region of al-Andalus, near the Portuguese border . This battle occurred during a period of significant political upheaval in the Iberian Peninsula, marked by the disintegration of the Umayyad Caliphate into various Taifa kingdoms . The Taifa period, lasting from 1013 to 1069, was characterized by competitive politics among these smaller kingdoms . This fragmentation created a power vacuum that was exploited by the expanding Christian kingdoms to the north, particularly the kingdom of Leon-Castile under Alfonso VI . Alfonso VI's ambition was to unite Iberia under his rule . The capture of Toledo by Alfonso VI in 1085 was a significant event that preceded the Battle of Zallaqa .",

The Almoravids, led by Yusuf ibn Tashufin, responded to the call and crossed the Strait of Gibraltar into al-Andalus .",

El Cid, who had previously served the Muslim king of Zaragoza, ruled Valencia from 1092 to 1099, defending it against the Almoravids . The Almoravids' intervention had a profound impact on religious tolerance and the treatment of minorities in al-Andalus . The years 1086-1094 were a time of political transition in Muslim Spain .",

The study of the Taifa Kings era (1013-1086) and the role of the 'ulama' (Muslim religious and legal scholars) provides further context for understanding the events leading up to the battle . Contemporary historians often view the Andalusi ulama as a homogeneous group, but this view is challenged by dividing them into \"mosque ulama\" and \"palace ulama\" . Most historical sources for the Taifa kings era are narrated from the point of view of a subset of the mosque ulama who opposed the Taifa kings and supported their overthrow . The battle is also examined through the lens of mythos and logos, analyzing how poetic and historical narratives shaped its memory .",
