          "text": "The Almoravids (al-Murabitun), meaning \"monk warriors,\" emerged as a rigorous religious movement among the Sanhaja Berbers in the Sahara . Their origins can be traced to the 11th century, with a focus on legalistic piety and \"holy war\" against perceived moral laxity among Muslims . The Berber groups, Lamtuna, Massufa and Djuddala, converted to Islam superficially and later formed the core of the Almoravid movement . The movement was initiated by Yahyà Ibn Ibrahim in the Sahara desert . Abu Bakr and Yusuf Ibn Tashufin led the Almoravids in military expansion across North Africa . Yusuf Ibn Tasufin organized the Almoravids politically, conquering North Africa from 1055 .",
