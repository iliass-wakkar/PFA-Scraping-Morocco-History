This unification surpassed the earlier efforts of the Almoravids . The movement stemmed from a \"religious reform\" initiated by Ibn Tumart, who became the Mahdi of the Almohads . The Muwahhidun (unitarians) formed the core support base for the Almohad movement . The Almohads' doctrine emphasized *tawhid* (the affirmation of the oneness of God) and rejected anthropomorphism .",
