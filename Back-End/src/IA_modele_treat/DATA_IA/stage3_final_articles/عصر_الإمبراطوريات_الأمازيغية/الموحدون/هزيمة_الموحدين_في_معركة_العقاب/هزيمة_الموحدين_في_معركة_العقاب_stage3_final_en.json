          "text": "The Almohad Caliphate, during its expansion in the western Mediterranean, made critical strategic errors that ultimately contributed to its defeat at the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa (معركة العقاب) . The Almohads expanded eastward, opening a front with Arab tribes in Africa and the Banu Ghaniya in the Balearic Islands . This focus on the eastern front led to a neglect of the northern front in al-Andalus, which proved to be a more significant threat . Azz al-Din Jassus argues that this strategic misdirection was a key factor in the Almohad defeat . The Almohads lacked a balanced geo-political view and failed to recognize the greater danger posed by the Christian kingdoms in the north . Francisco García Fitz's work examines Castilian-Leonese politics in the face of the Almohad empire, highlighting the context leading up to this pivotal battle .",

          "text": "The Almohad defeat at the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa (معركة العقاب) had catastrophic consequences for both al-Andalus and Morocco . The Christian Reconquista capitalized on the Almohad weakness, seizing the Balearic Islands . Furthermore, major cities such as Cordoba, Valencia, Murcia, Jaen, and Seville fell to the Christians during this period . The defeat marked a turning point in the history of al-Andalus, accelerating the decline of Muslim rule in the Iberian Peninsula .",

          "text": "The defeat of the Almohads at Las Navas de Tolosa occurred within a broader context of political and military interactions between the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa . The book \"Relaciones políticas y guerra : la experiencia castellano-leonesa frente al Islam : siglos XI-XIII\" explores these relations from the 11th to the 13th centuries . The Almohad Empire was a key player in this dynamic . The defeat also impacted later events, such as the defeat of the Portuguese by the Moors in Alcácer Quibir, which contributed to the rise of Portuguese Sebastianism, a form of royal messianism . Jacqueline Hermann's article discusses royal messianism in the Iberian world between the 14th and 16th centuries, tracing its roots back to the Middle Ages and its development in the Modern Period . The defeat at Alcácer Quibir created a specific political context that fueled messianic expectations .",
