          "text": "Al-Andalus, the term used by Muslims to refer to the Iberian Peninsula, was established following the Muslim conquest in 711 AD . This conquest, led by Arab and Berber troops, brought an end to Visigothic rule in Hispania . The Muslim forces, under the leadership of figures like Tariq ibn Ziyad, gained control over most of the peninsula, with the exception of the mountainous regions in the north and northwest where Christian kingdoms emerged . By the 11th century, the majority of the population in Al-Andalus were Arabic-speaking Muslims . The Christian population diminished through emigration, deportation, and conversion, while Jewish communities generally flourished, although periods of forced conversion did occur .",

          "text": "The Umayyad dynasty, after being overthrown in the Levant, established an independent emirate in Al-Andalus in 756 CE . Cordoba became the capital, first of the Umayyad emirate (756–929) and then of the Umayyad caliphate (929–1031) . During this period, Cordoba became a major center of wealth and culture in Europe, flourishing due to agriculture and trade . However, the Umayyad Caliphate was abolished in 1031, leading to the emergence of smaller Taifa kingdoms . These Taifa kingdoms, ruled by local notables, were militarily weak and forced to pay tribute to the advancing Christian kingdoms . The fall of Toledo to the Christians in 1085 prompted the Taifa kings to seek aid from the Almoravids .",

In the last two decades, the Spanish press's portrayal of the Muslim world shifted from unsympathetic to enthusiastic . This change is partly due to immigration trends, control over oil resources, and relativism in Western discourses towards the Third World . In Spain, a significant internal element is the mass-media's reinvention of a mythical al-Andalus as a tolerant and pluralistic society . This idealized interpretation of seven centuries of Muslim presence in the Iberian Peninsula is based on ignorance and distorts the historical record . The manipulation of the myth of al-Andalus, regardless of intent, has ideological and political implications .",
