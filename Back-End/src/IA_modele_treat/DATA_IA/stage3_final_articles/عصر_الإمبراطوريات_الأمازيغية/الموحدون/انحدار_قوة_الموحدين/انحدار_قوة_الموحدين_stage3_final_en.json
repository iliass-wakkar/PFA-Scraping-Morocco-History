          "text": "The Almohad Empire, or al-Muwahhidūn, was founded in the mid-12th century . The movement originated among the Maṣmūda tribes of the High Atlas Mountains in Morocco . Ibn Tūmart, a Maṣmūda Berber tribesman, was considered the mahdī by the Almohads . He preached the Almohad doctrine from 1117 until his death in 1130 . Ibn Tūmart was born around 1081 in Igli, a village in the Hargha tribe . He traveled to Cordoba in 1106 to study Zahirite doctrine and subsequently to the Mashreq, including Baghdad, where he studied Ash'arite theology under the influence of al-Ghazali . Upon his return to the Maghreb in 1117, he preached against the decadent lifestyles of the urban population and was expelled from Bejaïa for his extremism .",
