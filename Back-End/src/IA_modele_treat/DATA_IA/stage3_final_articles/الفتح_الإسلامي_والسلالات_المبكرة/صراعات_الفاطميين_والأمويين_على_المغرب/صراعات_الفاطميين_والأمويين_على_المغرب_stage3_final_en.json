The Fatimids, a Shia Muslim dynasty, claimed descent from the Prophet Muhammad's daughter Fatima and sought to establish their rule in North Africa . They aimed to extend their control throughout the region and even into Egypt, challenging the Abbasid caliphate . The Umayyads, based in al-Andalus, also sought to exert their influence in North Africa . Previous analyses often prioritized the geopolitical rivalry between the Umayyads and Fatimids as the primary driver of conflict .",

The Zirids were a Berber dynasty who initially served as Fatimid vassals . However, the Zirids eventually broke away from Fatimid rule in 1048 . In response, the Fatimids sent the Banu Hilal and Banu Sulaym Arab tribes to Ifriqiya in 1051-1052 . These tribes, estimated at 50,000 warriors and 200,000 Bedouins, were given land grants (iqtâ') by the Fatimid caliph . The arrival of the Hilalian tribes is often characterized as an invasion, with devastating consequences for the region . Ibn Khaldun described the Hilal tribes as destructive nomads, contrasting their lifestyle with settled urban populations .",

          "text": "The Hilalians' advance led to a devastating conflict with the Zirides, culminating in the fall of Kairouan after a five-year siege (1051-1056) . The Zirid dynasty fled to Mahdiya . The Hilalian tribes expanded throughout the eastern Maghreb, taking control of the plains and coastal areas, while the Berbers retreated to the mountainous regions . The fragmentation of Ifriqiya resulted in local authorities paying tribute to Hilalian chiefs . The Hilalians' impact on the region was seen as both negative (political fragmentation, economic disruption) and positive (cultural exchange, demographic shift) . Some historians argued that the Hilalian migrations were a consequence of the weakness of the urban centers in North Africa . The Hilalian tribes' arrival marked a turning point in the history of the Maghreb, introducing new dialects and impacting the cultural landscape of the region . The Hilalian tribes were eventually integrated into the Berber population, leading to a significant cultural and ethnic exchange . The arrival of the Hilalians marked a notable shift from classic Arabic to regional, vernacular dialects infused with Berber influences . Despite initial conflicts, some later Berbers and the Hilal tribes formed alliances and/or sought partnerships to maintain their respective power .",

          "text": "The circulation of Sudanese gold in the 4th/10th century played a significant role in the political landscape of the Maghreb . The gold was extracted and refined in the Niger Bend, transported across the Sahara to the Maghreb, and then potentially to al-Andalus, the Latin West, or the Middle East . While the territorial disputes between the Umayyads and Fatimids are important, the gold trade from the Sudan to al-Andalus deserves more study . Examining the gold trade offers a new perspective on the 4th/10th century Maghreb before the rise of Berber dynasties . The author argues for a more comprehensive understanding that incorporates the gold trade's role .",
