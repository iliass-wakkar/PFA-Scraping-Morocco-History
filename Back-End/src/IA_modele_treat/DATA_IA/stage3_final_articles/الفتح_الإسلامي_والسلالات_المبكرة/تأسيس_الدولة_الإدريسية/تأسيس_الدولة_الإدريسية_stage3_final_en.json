The Jewish tribes took on a political role in the subjugation of Morocco to Idriss I . After conquering Tangier and Volubilis, Idriss I sought to persuade the Jewish tribes to join his army . Idriss I attacked and plundered some Jewish cities like Temesna, Chellah, and Magada, prompting Jews of Tadla, Fazaz, and Shawiya to join his army under \"general\" Benjamin-monta Joshaphat-monto Abiezer . After some successes, the Jewish contingent withdrew from Idriss I's army due to their aversion to bloodshed amongst their 'brothers' . Idriss I retaliated against the Jewish community after their withdrawal . The Jewish communities ultimately made peace with Idriss I, agreeing to pay a yearly capitation tax .",

          "text": "While Idrīs I and Idrīs II are generally considered the founders of Muslim Morocco, Rāšid's role has been historically marginalized . Rāšid succeeded Idrīs I and ruled for approximately twelve years . Rāšid minted coins in his name in Volubilis and Tāhirt, the Rustamid capital . The oldest anonymous coins found in Fès were minted during Rāšid's reign, suggesting he may have founded the city . Some historians initially identified Rāšid b. Qādim as an Abbasid governor, but Moroccan archaeologists later suggested he was a local prince . It is now argued that Rāšid b. Qādim was the regent for Idrīs II during his minority . Fulūs of Rāšid b. Qādim found in Volubilis and Tahert are similar to those of Idrīs II (175/791-213/828) struck in Volubilis . The fulūs of Rāšid b. Qādim are also analogous to those of the Rustumid ʿAbd al-Wahhāb b. Rustum (r. 167/784-199/824) struck at Tahert and Tlemcen . The type of fulūs minted by the Idrisids and Rustumids is distinct from other coinage in the Maghreb at the time .",

The historical city of Fez was considered the capital of the Idrisid state from the middle of the third century AH / ninth century AD . Favorable geographical and strategic factors allowed the Idrisid rulers to govern effectively from Fes . Fes became a hub for scholars, traders, and a successful industrial zone under Idrisid rule .

Kenza, wife of Idris I, was a key figure who provided advice to rulers and held a prominent position among the Berbers . Kenza was instrumental in maintaining the Zaydi ideology after the death of Idris I . Kenza influenced Idris I's decisions and played a role in dividing the Idrisid territories among his sons and grandsons . Fatima al-Fihri (Umm al-Banin) founded the al-Qarawiyyin mosque in Fez in 245 AH, which became a major center of learning . The construction of al-Qarawiyyin was financed by Fatima al-Fihri and involved using materials from the land she purchased, reflecting her religious commitment . Al-Qarawiyyin is considered the oldest university in the world still in operation . Maryam al-Fihri, Fatima's sister, founded the al-Andalusiyyin mosque in Fez . Atika bint Ali ibn Omar al-Idrisi played a key role in her father assuming power during a period of unrest .",
