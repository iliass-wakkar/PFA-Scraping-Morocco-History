          "text": "The history of Morocco is marked by numerous Berber revolts, stemming from resistance to various forms of external rule and cultural assimilation. The Arab conquest of North Africa in the 7th and 8th centuries brought Islam to the region, but also sparked resistance from the Berber populations . The Arab expansion westward along the southern Mediterranean shore, beginning twenty years after the Hijra, posed a threat to Europe and involved interactions and conflicts with the Berber populations . The Berbers resisted the Arab conquest, which also brought different branches of Islam, including Shī‘ite and Khārijite influences .",

Tariq ibn Ziyad, a Berber, led troops in 710 consisting of seventeen thousand Arabs and twelve thousand Berber horse . However, Umayyad policies, including heavy taxation, resource exploitation, and social discrimination, fueled resentment among the Berbers .",

Berbers accepted Ṣufrism and Ibāḍism due to their emphasis on equality among Muslims regardless of ethnic origin, and to maintain political autonomy and strengthen Berber cultural identity . The Khārijite revolt in North Africa serves as a reference point for analyzing Arabic texts about the Berbers from different traditions . The role of the Berbers is a variable in these texts, sometimes converging with the stigma of the Khārijites in the Sunni world .",

The revolt led by Mûnise was triggered by harsh Umayyad policies towards the Maghrib Berbers . The Mûnise revolt resulted in the weakening of Muslim rule in northern Andalusia, allowing Christians to begin the Reconquista . The Great Berber Revolt caused throne fights, civil wars, famine, land losses, and cessation of military activities in Andalusia, radically shaking Muslim domination .",

The Moroccan state has gone to considerable lengths in legitimizing Amazigh identity, culminating in the adoption in July 2011 of a new constitution which explicitly recognizes the Amazigh language as an official state language .",

Amazigh militants played a role in the Arab Spring demonstrations and supported popular contestation movements . Amazigh activists used distinctive flags and banners during the Arab Spring uprisings, seeking to assert separate identity and challenge the narrative of a uniform Arab Spring . Beyond socioeconomic difficulties, protests in several countries revealed 'cultural claims' from populations refusing assimilation to Arab culture . The Amazigh cultural movement became increasingly influential and organized in the decade leading up to the Arab Spring . The development of the internet helped the Amazigh movement become transnational, incorporating Amazigh minorities and the diaspora . The Amazigh movement includes cultural and political associations with different goals, such as promoting Amazigh languages/traditions and advocating for constitutional rights .",
