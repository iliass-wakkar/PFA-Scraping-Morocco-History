This expansion was not a random event but based on a well-structured military plan initiated by the Caliphs and governors . The conquest began with initial reconnaissance campaigns . Egypt served as a base to oversee the conquest of the Maghreb . In 22 AH/643 AD, Amr ibn al-Aas seized Cyrenaica with little resistance from the Luwata and Hawwara Berbers . He also captured Tripoli after a rapid siege . In 27 AH/647 AD, Abd Allah ibn Sa'd launched an attack against Byzacena and defeated the exarch Gregorius near Suffetula (Sbeitla) .",
