  "article_text_raw": "# The Battle of Annual: A Spanish Defeat in Morocco\n\n## Background and Context\n\nThe Battle of Annual, a major military defeat for Spain in Morocco, took place in July 1921 in the Rif region of northern Morocco [20, 29]. This battle was a significant event in the Rif War (1921-1927), a conflict between the Spanish army and the Rif rebels led by Abd el-Krim [8, 14, 29]. Spain's presence in Morocco was rooted in a desire to reclaim national honor after losing its American colonies in 1898 and to reintegrate into international alliances [25, 46]. European powers feared a Spanish agreement with another nation would threaten French sea routes and British control of Gibraltar [46]. The Entente Cordiale of 1904 between Britain and France allocated a sphere of influence to Spain in northern Morocco [46]. The Conference of Algeciras in 1906 stipulated that Morocco should be open to international trade and guaranteed the Sultan's sovereignty, tasking France and Spain with maintaining order in their spheres [46]. The Treaty of Fez in 1912 formally established the Spanish Protectorate in Morocco [23, 46].\n\nHowever, Spain's control was challenged by the Rif tribes, who sought independence [3]. The Spanish zone encompassed approximately 22,000 square kilometers, including the Rif mountains, presenting significant geographical and climatic challenges for military operations [46]. Armed resistance to Spanish penetration began in the late 19th century, including the Guerra de Margallo (1893-1894) [25]. By 1919, the Spanish army in Morocco was suffering from technical insufficiencies and a diffuse command structure [29].\n\n## The Disaster at Annual\n\nIn 1920, General Fernández Silvestre became Commander General of Melilla, aiming to reach the Bay of Alhucemas, the center of Rif operations [29]. By May 1921, the Spanish penetration had reached 130 kilometers to Buy Meyan and Annual [29]. Silvestre's forces were spread across 140 isolated positions, making them vulnerable to attack [29]. The location of the Spanish outposts was based more on political considerations than on military strategy [29]. The Spanish troops were largely untrained conscripts, poorly equipped, and with low morale [29].\n\nOn July 22, 1921, approximately 5,000 Spanish soldiers in Annual were attacked by 18,000 Rif rebels [29]. General Silvestre decided to evacuate Annual due to lack of water and the arrival of three columns of Rif rebels [29]. The retreat from Annual turned into a disorganized rout, with many soldiers and officers abandoning their posts [29]. Approximately 2,500 Spanish soldiers died in four hours during the retreat from Annual, in addition to another 1,500 from other positions [29]. Approximately 492 Spanish soldiers were taken prisoner at Annual [29]. The forces retreating from Annual fell back to Dar Drius and later to Monte Arruit, where they were besieged [29]. General Navarro surrendered Monte Arruit on August 9, 1921, and almost all of the 3,000 soldiers were massacred by Abd el-Krim's forces [29]. In total, approximately 10,000 Spanish soldiers died in the Disaster of Annual [20, 21, 25, 26, 29, 36, 42, 59, 62, 70, 73, 78, 83, 85, 95, 100, 104].\n\n## Causes and Contributing Factors\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the Spanish defeat at Annual. The Spanish army suffered from technical insufficiencies, a diffuse command structure, and a lack of adequate training [29]. The Reglamento Táctico de Infantería de 1914, based on Prussian military thought, was inadequate for irregular warfare against Abd el-Krim's forces [78]. The overextension of General Silvestre's troops and the lack of a suitable military doctrine for counter-insurgency warfare also played a role [78]. The location of the Spanish outposts was based more on political considerations than on military strategy [29]. The Spanish troops were largely untrained conscripts, poorly equipped, and with low morale [29]. The Spanish army also suffered from corruption and incompetence [20, 25].\n\n## Aftermath and Consequences\n\nThe disaster at Annual triggered a political crisis in Spain, leading to protests and the resignation of the government [29, 62]. The defeat led to 'humiliation du corps militaire' and 'frustration coloniale,' fueling a loss of confidence in parliamentary institutions [6]. The defeat also contributed to a sentiment in Spain that Morocco was a burden [3]. General Juan Picasso was ordered to prepare a report (Expediente Picasso) on the events at Annual, which highlighted multiple military errors and negligence [29, 48, 49, 61, 65, 73, 85, 95]. The Expediente Picasso stated that 13,363 men died (10,973 Spaniards and 2,390 indigenous) compared to 1,000 Riffians [29]. The Picasso investigation revealed corruption and incompetence within the Spanish army [20].\n\nThe Disaster of Annual led to Abdelkrim solidifying his position as leader of the Riffian resistance [20]. After the Spanish defeat at Anoual in 1921, the Rifains captured considerable weaponry, allowing Abdelkrim to form a formidable army and triggering the proclamation of the Rif Republic [2]. The Republic of the Rif was a direct consequence of the Spanish disaster, providing an opportunity for independence from European and Moroccan control [20].\n\nThe political instability caused by the Disaster of Annual contributed to the *pronunciamiento* of September 1923 and the subsequent dictatorship of General Primo de Rivera [6, 20, 21, 25, 27, 31, 33, 47, 48, 49, 53, 59, 61, 65, 68, 73, 77, 83, 85, 89, 95, 109, 115]. Primo de Rivera justified his coup by citing the need for a 'chirurgien de fer', to address the problems exacerbated by the loss at Anoual [6]. The dictatorship of Primo de Rivera, starting in 1923, saw a rise in Hispano-Americanism used as a political tool for nationalization and cultural diplomacy [6].\n\n## Spanish Response and the End of the Rif War\n\nFollowing the Disaster of Annual, Spain launched a forceful counterattack known as the 'campaña del desquite' that involved increased troop deployments, war materials, and medical supplies [20]. The Spanish reoccupation of Monte Arruit on October 24th revealed the massacre of over 2,000 Spanish soldiers after their surrender [20]. The Alhucemas landing in 1925, a joint Spanish-French military operation, marked a turning point, leading to the defeat of Abd el-Krim and the Rif rebellion [4, 25, 77, 89]. Abd el-Krim surrendered to French forces in May 1926 [2, 16, 25]. The Rif War officially ended in 1927 [23].\n\n## The Use of Chemical Weapons\n\nFollowing the defeat at Annual, the Spanish authorities decided to employ chemical weapons to end the Rifian insurrection [14]. Général Dámaso Berenguer, the Spanish High Commissioner in Tetouan, expressed his intention to use asphyxiating gas with \"true delight\" [14]. Spain produced and used chemical weapons (phosgene, chloropicrine, and yperite) against the Rif rebels between 1921 and 1927 [14]. King Alphonse XIII of Spain stated in 1925 that \"with the help of the most harmful gas\" they would save many Spanish and French lives and that the Beni Ourriaguel and tribes closer to Abdelkrim should be exterminated like bad animals [14].\n\n## The Battle of Annual in Literature and Memory\n\nThe Disaster of Annual had a profound impact on Spanish society and was reflected in Spanish literature and art [42]. Ramón J. Sender's novel 'Iman' (1930) reconstructs the Disaster of Annual through the eyes of Viance, a common soldier, critiquing the colonial policies of the Spanish state [26]. The novel was written to counter the 'official discourse' that hid the suffering of ordinary soldiers [26]. The Poem of Dhar Oubarran, a 1921 Rif poetic epic, critiques the behaviors and actions of Spain during the Battle of Annual from the local Rif perspective [19].\n\nThe Moroccan regime in Rabat is uncomfortable with Riffian nationalism and does not valorize the Republic of the Rif [20]. Celebrations in commemoration of the battle of Annual in the Rif were prohibited during 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 [67].",
