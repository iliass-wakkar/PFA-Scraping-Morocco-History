  "article_text_raw": "# The Berber Dahir and the Rise of Moroccan Nationalism\n\n## Background and Context\n\nIn the early 20th century, Morocco was a land of diverse cultures and languages, including Arabic and Berber (also known as Amazigh) [55]. The Alawite dynasty theoretically united the country, but in practice, Morocco consisted of numerous small, independent states [91]. The Sultan's authority was largely confined to cities and major routes, with religious fiefdoms, temporal principalities, and Berber republics also existing [91]. The French Protectorate was established in 1912 through the Treaty of Fez, placing Morocco under French control while ceding a coastal area along the Strait of Gibraltar to Spain [2, 22]. This treaty allowed France to occupy parts of Morocco under the guise of protecting the sovereign [22]. The French Resident-General gained the sole right to represent Morocco in foreign countries [22].\n\nPrior to the French Protectorate, Spain and France had been vying for influence in Morocco [86]. The Act of Algeciras in 1906 granted France partial control of customs and the National Bank of Morocco [142]. The French colonial administration, under Marshal Lyautey, aimed to modernize the country while preserving its traditions [29, 61]. However, this approach was not always consistent, and tensions arose between the French administration and Moroccan society [103].\n\n## The Berber Dahir of 1930\n\nOn May 16, 1930, the French Protectorate authorities promulgated the Berber Dahir (also referred to as the Berber Decree), a decree that formalized the tribal law system (droit coutumier) in Berber-dominant rural areas of Morocco [2, 12, 10]. The Dahir divided the French Protectorate into zones governed by Sharia law and Berber customary law [10, 10, 29]. It aimed to adapt Berber justice to modern conditions, following the spirit of the Dahir of September 11, 1914, signed by Lyautey [79]. The policy sought to preserve Berber autonomy, especially in legal matters, by keeping them outside Islamic law (Chrâa) and maintaining their customary law (Orf or Izref) [79, 80]. The administration was tasked with defining Berber laws and designating Berber tribes, primarily based on submission to military authorities [79].\n\nThe Dahir also imposed the supremacy of French law in Berber regions [10]. Article 6 of the Dahir Berbère stated that French courts were competent to repress crimes committed in Berber regions regardless of the status of the perpetrator [79].\n\n## Moroccan Reactions and Resistance\n\nThe Berber Dahir was met with widespread opposition from Moroccan nationalists, who viewed it as an attempt to divide the country and Christianize the Berbers [4, 10, 18, 21, 33, 40, 55, 79, 80]. Nationalists framed the Dahir as an attempt to abolish Islamic law [13]. The decree was seen as an assault on Muslim identity [33]. The protests against the Berber Dahir began in Salé a few weeks after its promulgation, centered around the recitation of the latif, a collective prayer invoking God in situations of disaster [10]. The protests spread from Salé to other cities like Rabat, Fez, and Casablanca [10].\n\nThe protests helped to unify an emerging Moroccan nationalist movement [10]. The national movement was founded on the sentiment of belonging to the Islamic community and the Arab nation [4]. The feeling of belonging to the Muslim community (al-ummat al-islamîya) was a dominant factor in this nationalism [4]. The protests took place during a period of economic uncertainty, including the global crisis of 1929 and local issues like droughts and locust plagues [10].\n\nThe protests in Salé were initiated by a group of young men, aged 17-25, who were active in cultural institutions with proto-nationalist leanings [10]. Abdelatif Subihi, an employee of the colonial administration and graduate of the School of Oriental Languages in Paris, played a key role in initiating the protests in Salé [10]. The anniversary of the Berber Dahir on May 16th was commemorated annually with gatherings in mosques to recite the latif [10].\n\n## International Reactions\n\nThe Berber Dahir also drew international attention and condemnation [4]. Chakib Arsalan, a prominent Druze Syrian and advocate of pan-Arabism, visited Morocco in 1930 and promoted the Moroccan struggle in his newspaper La Nation Arabe [10]. In January 1931, 12 Islamic associations in Java created a Muslim Committee for the defense of the Berbers [10]. The Islamic Congress of Jerusalem in December 1931 approved a declaration calling on France to withdraw the Dahir [10]. Letters of protest were sent from the Pan-Islamic Congress and the Associations of Young Muslims from other regions of the Arab world [4].\n\n## French Responses and the Dahir's Legacy\n\nThe French authorities responded to the protests with repression, arresting and exiling nationalist leaders [79]. However, they also attempted to address some of the concerns raised by the protests [79]. In 1934, Article 6 of the Berber Dahir was repealed, uniformizing penal jurisdictions [79].\n\nDespite this abrogation, the French Berber policy continued [79]. The Berber Dahir remained in effect until 1956 [10]. The Sultán criticized the manipulation of the Latif by young nationalists in August 11 [10]. On August 27, 1930 a delegation of nationalists visited the Sultan in Fez to deliver a memorandum [10]. The Berber Dahir contributed to giving the Moroccan national movement unity and coherence [4]. The monolingual identity of Morocco was decided in the 1930s after the Berber Dahir [18].\n\n## The Berber Dahir as a Foundational Myth\n\nThe protests against the Berber Dahir have been framed as a foundational myth of Moroccan nationalism [10]. The Dahir was framed by nationalists as an attempt to divide the country and Christianize the Berbers [10]. The young men came up with a powerful counter narrative about Moroccan culture and identity, stressing the unity of the nation founded on Islam and Arabism [29]. The Berber Dahir unified salafi and nationalist sentiments and was viewed as an assault on Muslim identity [33].\n\n## The Aftermath and the Amazigh Movement\n\nAfter independence in 1956, the three legal zones, French, Spanish and International, were brought under one common legal regime [29]. Allal al-Fasi strived to create a new legislation based on Islamic law, understood according to the reformist ideals of the neo-salafiyya movement [29]. The Moroccan State's ambiguous politics of Arabisation in the aftermath of independence in 1956 [13].\n\nThe marginalization of Berber language and culture continued in the post-colonial era, leading to the rise of the Amazigh movement [8, 24]. The Amazigh movement aims to recognize the impact of Amazigh culture on Moroccan history and the importance of the Tamazight language [8]. The Amazigh movement has achieved successes, including the creation of the IRCAM (a government institution dedicated to Amazigh culture) and the recognition of Tamazight as an official language [8].\n\nIn 1994, King Hassan II of Morocco publicly addressed the 'Berber question' and advocated for teaching Berber dialects in schools [24]. The Royal Institute of Amazigh Culture (IRCAM) was established in Morocco in 2001 to promote Berber culture and language [24]. The Moroccan constitution of 2011 recognized Tamazight as an official language [6, 24]. The 2011 constitution states that Morocco's national identity is based on the convergence of Arab-Islamic, Amazigh, and Saharan components, along with African, Andalusian, Hebrew, and Mediterranean influences [6].\n\nDespite these advancements, challenges remain [24, 25, 46]. Attempts to form a Berber political party in Morocco in 2015 were blocked by the government [24]. Institutionalized discrimination against Amazigh ethnicities and their languages in Morocco persists [46].",
