  "article_text_raw": "# Early Resistance Campaigns in Morocco\n\n## Pre-Roman Resistance\n\nThe history of Morocco, or ancient Mauretania, is marked by early resistance campaigns against foreign powers. The kingdom of Mauretania remained neutral during the conflict between Rome and Carthage [1]. The war led by Jugurtha was a turning point in the region's history [1].\n\n## Roman Occupation and the Aedemon Revolt\n\nIn the 1st century AD, Mauretania was occupied by Rome following the death of King Ptolemy and the subsequent revolt led by Aedemon [1]. Despite the suppression of the Aedemon revolt, Roman campaigns and treaties failed to completely quell ongoing resistance [1]. The revolt of the Mauri against Ascalis occurred towards the end of Bocchus' reign [1]. Between 81 and 80 BC, Pompeius led a campaign that resulted in the destruction of cities like Zili, Sidi Abdel Salam del Behar, Thamusida, and Lixus [1]. After Bocchus' death, Octavius intervened directly in Mauretania due to a succession crisis between 33 and 25 BC [1].\n\nThe Roman resistance led to the establishment of settlements like Zili, Banasa, and Baba as footholds for control [1]. The revolt of Aedemon occurred after the assassination of King Ptolemy and lasted for two years [1]. Volubilis played a significant role in supporting the Romans during the period after 40 AD [1]. Volubilis entered into an alliance with Rome, helping the Roman army in exchange for protection [1]. This alliance occurred during the interregnum from 33 to 25 BC [1]. The inhabitants of Volubilis sided with the Romans during the Aedemon war [1]. The war of Aedemon began during the reign of Caligula and continued during the reign of Claudius, ending with a Roman victory in 42 AD [1]. Some scholars believe the municipality of Volubilis was created during the Aedemon revolt [1]. After the Aedemon revolt, Sextius Caecilianus was appointed to an administrative role in 75 AD [1]. Suetonius Paulinus led the pursuit of the Mauri to the foothills of the Atlas Mountains [1]. Hosidius Geta confronted the resistance of Salabus, which ended in a truce [1]. In 42 AD, Emperor Claudius divided Mauretania into Mauretania Caesariensis and Mauretania Tingitana [1]. The appointment of M. Fadius Celer Maximus as governor (Prolegatus) indicates that unrest continued in Mauretania Tingitana [1].\n\n## Linguistic and Cultural Resistance\n\nMorocco's geographic location has resulted in a diverse culture influenced by various civilizations, including Amazigh [2]. Linguistic and cultural diversity has been a fundamental characteristic and asset of Morocco throughout its history [2]. The Amazigh language is considered the oldest language in Morocco and held a significant role in the past, including during the Almohad dynasty [2].\n\n## Colonial Resistance (Later Periods)\n\nThe French protectorate (1912-1956) brought about significant socio-cultural and linguistic changes in Morocco [2]. The French and Spanish implemented language policies aimed at promoting their respective languages during the colonial period [2]. The French sought to establish French as the preferred foreign language in liberated colonies and as part of the colonies' identity [2]. The French created a division between 'advanced' and 'underdeveloped' languages, favoring European languages over languages from the 'Third World' [2]. The French colonial administration emphasized the importance of education in solidifying French linguistic policy [2]. The French established different types of schools, including those for the general public and those for the elite, with French receiving a significant portion of instruction time [2]. In 1912, the French established the 'École supérieure de langue arabe et dialectes berbères', which later became the 'Institut des Hautes Études Marocaines' in 1921, to train translators and administrators [2]. Throughout the Protectorate, the French language was used in various official documents and reports, becoming the official language of the colonial authorities [2]. The French protectorate authorities damaged the status of Classical Arabic due to their support and promotion of the French language [2]. The French established French-Amazigh schools in the Middle Atlas region to appeal to the Amazigh population, with a focus on teaching practical agriculture, basic arithmetic, health, French, and written Amazigh using the Latin alphabet [2]. The 'Collège d'Azrou' (secondary school) was established in 1930 by the French, aiming to integrate French influence in the Amazigh mountains [2]. Despite efforts, the Collège d'Azrou largely directed Amazigh students towards French education and did not rely on the Amazigh language, thus failing to achieve its goals [2]. The Spanish Protectorate did not develop as deep a linguistic policy as the French, but the prolonged occupation and cultural measures led to the spread of Spanish in the northern regions [2]. After independence, the question of language arose, with some advocating for the French language, others opposing it, and some trying to reconcile both positions [2]. The introduction of colonial education in Morocco resulted in a cultural duality, dividing the intellectual elite into those educated in the traditional system and those educated in the modern system [2]. After independence, the French language continued to hold a prominent position in Morocco, being taught from primary school to university and used as the language of instruction in several faculties [2]. The Moroccan constitution of 2011 recognized the Amazigh language alongside Arabic [2].",
