  "article_text_raw": "# Urban Resistance Movements in Morocco\n\n## Historical Context and Pre-Colonial Resistance\n\nMorocco's history is marked by a struggle for territorial control and development, a theme that has shaped its policies for over a century [31]. Even in the pre-colonial era, the Makhzen, or central government, faced challenges in exerting direct control over its territory, often relying on intermediaries such as tribal leaders and religious brotherhoods [31]. Traditional organizations played a role in local development and land management [12]. Robert Montagne described the tribe's political structure as progressing from a republican system to autocratic rule, followed by the intervention of the Makhzen and, ultimately, the dominance of 'Siba' (dissidence) [12].\n\n## Colonial Era Resistance\n\nEuropean powers undermined Moroccan independence through debt and trade in the late 19th century [31]. The French Protectorate, established in 1912 and lasting until 1956, significantly impacted Moroccan political and social structures [11, 12]. The colonial administration divided Morocco into a \"useful Morocco\" (plains and coastal regions) and a \"Berber Morocco\" (mountainous and Saharan regions) based on ethnicity and economic potential [31]. The Berber Dahir of May 16, 1930, served as a catalyst for the Moroccan nationalist movement and the formation of political parties by threatening Islamic Law [11, 12]. This decree was a key element in the colonial policy of separating Berber populations from Arab populations and subjecting them to customary law [31]. The Berber Dahir triggered a wave of opposition and contributed to the emergence of the Moroccan Nationalist Movement [11].\n\nUrban resistance to the colonial occupation was quickly suppressed, highlighting the cities' structural weaknesses inherited from the pre-colonial period [31]. The الكتلة الوطنية (National Action Bloc) was formed in 1934 as one of the first Moroccan political parties [11, 12]. In 1937, French authorities arrested علال الفاسي, عمر عبد الجليل, and أحمد مكوار in October 25, 1937, and الوزاني five days later, suppressing the initial party formation [11, 12]. The الأحزاب الوطنية (Nationalist Parties) advocated for reforms, especially in political and economic sectors, during the initial phase of the Protectorate [11]. Following the 1942 Anfa Conference, the حزب الاستقلال (Independence Party) was formed, and بلحسن الوزاني established the حزب الشورى والاستقلال (Consultation and Independence Party) [11, 12]. In July 1943, the Moroccan Communist Party was المغربة (Moroccanized) under the leadership of علي يعتة (Ali Yata) [11, 12]. The الأحزاب الوطنية (Nationalist Parties) advocated for independence and support for Sultan Mohammed V [11]. The colonial policy led to the marginalization of the \"Berber Morocco\" and its isolation from the modernization process in the plains [31]. France and Spain allied to crush the uprising of Mohamed ben Abdelkrim al-Khattabi in 1925 [31].\n\n## Post-Independence Challenges and Urban Development\n\nAfter independence in 1956, the Moroccan state faced the challenge of integrating a territory marked by regional disparities and power struggles [31]. The army of liberation which contributed to the independence was repressed in 1958 which resulted in a fragile newly independent state [31]. The state saw the countryside as places of weakness whereas urban areas were previously decisive for independence [31]. The colonial legacy included a million hectares of land in the best regions of the country, along with modern farms and a diversified industry [31]. The المخطط الخماسي (Five-Year Plan) of 1959-1960 was established by the الحركة الوطنية (National Movement) government led by عبد الله إبراهيم (Abdallah Ibrahim) [11, 12]. The government of Abdullah Ibrahim, during its time, forced the Palace to share power with the parties of the national movement [12]. The برنامج الانعاش الوطني (National Recovery Program) was launched to combat unemployment under the supervision of the وزارة الداخلية (Ministry of Interior) [11]. The المخطط الثلاثي (Three-Year Plan) between 1965 and 1968 focused on agriculture and tourism, aiming to reduce state intervention [11]. During the 1960's until the late 1970's, Morocco entered a state of exception and political activism was banned [12]. There were revolts in the High Atlas and Rif regions in 1958 as a result of the fragile state and the repression [31].\n\n## Economic Policies and Social Unrest\n\nThe صندوق النقد الدولي (International Monetary Fund) began direct intervention in the Moroccan economy in July 1980, concurrent with Ronald Reagan's presidency [11, 12]. The أحداث الدار البيضاء 1981 (Casablanca events of 1981) were a direct consequence of the التقويم الهيكلي (Structural Adjustment) policy [11, 12]. Morocco became unable to import goods in 1983 despite receiving aid from Gulf states [11, 12]. Tax reforms were initiated in 1986, including corporate tax in 1987 and general income tax in 1989 [11].\n\n## Contemporary Urban Movements and Challenges\n\nThe حكومة التناوب (Alternation Government) emerged in a global political climate dominated by American-led liberalism [11]. The المؤتمر السابع لحزب العدالة والتنمية (Justice and Development Party's Seventh Congress) in 2012 emphasized the importance of local development [11]. From the 2011-2016 to 2016-2021, the Justice and Development Party (PJD) was in power [12]. The الزحف الإسمنتي (concrete sprawl) and the emergence of new cities around major urban centers placed demographic and real estate pressure on the Moroccan state [11]. The المجلس الاقتصادي والاجتماعي (Economic and Social Council) issued a report in 2017 highlighting infrastructure weaknesses and limited access to basic services in rural areas [11, 12]. الأحزاب السياسية (political parties) often take to تظاهر حول حقوقه المطلبية من خلال تنسيقيات وإطارات جماهرية جمعوية بعيدا عن السياسة (protesting for their rights through grassroots coordination and community frameworks far from politics) [11]. Since 1994, the border between Algeria and Morocco was closed [12].\n\nContemporary urban movements in Morocco are influenced by global trends and local specificities [1, 3, 4, 5]. These movements often address issues such as privatization of services, gentrification, lack of affordable housing, and accessible public spaces [3]. They can take diverse forms, including grassroots organizations, housing associations, and protests against profit-oriented urban policies [3]. The 'right to the city' has become a central concept, encompassing both individual liberty to access urban resources and the collective power to reshape urbanization processes [3].\n\n## Informal Settlements and the \"Cities Without Slums\" Program\n\nInformal settlements remain prevalent in Morocco, often populated by those excluded by increased privatization [32]. The 'Arab Spring' revealed a demand for the 'right to the city' [32]. Lamia Zaki's chapter examines urban resistance movements in Moroccan slums from the 1990s to the Arab Spring [33]. The chapter analyzes the dynamic relationship between public action and popular protest in Moroccan slums [33]. The study focuses on the impact of national and international contexts on mobilizations and the ability of slum dwellers to influence public action [33]. The research examines the impact of the Arab Spring on informal settlements, assessing transformations in the 'Villes sans bidonvilles' (Cities Without Slums) program in Casablanca [33]. The 'Villes sans bidonvilles' (PVSB) program was initiated in 2005 to eliminate slums in urban areas [33]. The PVSB program aimed to address 324,000 households (1.6 million inhabitants) in over 1,000 neighborhoods across 85 cities, including nearly a third in Casablanca [33]. The article mentions the Mouvement du 20 février, the Moroccan version of the Arab Spring, and its impact [33]. The study discusses the evolution of policies towards Moroccan slums, oscillating between prohibition, laissez-faire, promises of relocation, and threats of expulsion [33]. The period following the Arab Spring saw increased difficulties for authorities to contain illegal construction and installations [33]. The study highlights the creation of a national coordination of bidonvilles at the end of 2010 following the imprisonment of six residents of a bidonville in Mohammedia [33]. The study mentions attempts by residents of bidonvilles to interfere in the attribution of titles and relocation [33].\n\n## Forms of Resistance and Social Control\n\nExpressions of injustice in public spaces are shaped by political regimes, spatial configurations of cities, political cultures, and urban policies [19]. The level of freedom and social control in public places influences the expression of justice and injustice [19]. The expression of injustice in public spaces is a \"translation\" of sentiment, influenced by local social control and forms of political opportunities [19]. The document mentions a royal tourism project in the Bou Regreg valley in Salé, Morocco, where local users, farmers, and industrialists contested its 'public utility' [19]. The legal procedure of 'declaration of public utility' (d'utilité publique) was used and contested by local actors in Salé during the Bou Regreg valley project [19]. The émeutes (riots) of 1996 in the peripheral neighborhood of Larhaouiyine in Casablanca blocked a major regional road, which contributed to their strong mediatisation and vigorous repression [19].\n\n## The Role of Associations and Political Engagement\n\nA study focusing on the politicization of actors in urban neighborhoods in Morocco, particularly in Casablanca, from 1998-2006, examined the relationship to politics through associative engagement [22]. The research involved interviews and observations of three associations in Casablanca and a semi-urban area near the city, examining six experiences associatives initially [22]. The study investigates how individuals with diverse backgrounds and experiences, including those with prior political activism and those new to political engagement, become involved in local associations [22]. The associations studied operated in different neighborhoods: HH., a dense area of small collective housing built in the 1950s, and DS., a densely populated, older, and more commercial area [22]. DJ association was founded in 1994 with the initial objective of raising the cultural level of the neighborhood HH after the elections of 1993 [22]. Association M. for social development was created in 1998 around K., a deputy from the PJD (Parti de la justice et du développement) [22]. AB association was also founded in 1998 around A., a former Marxist political prisoner, who became a local councilor [22]. The study explores the actors' political competencies, distinguishing between technical/cognitive, social/status-related, and practical/pragmatic competence [22]. The research examines the actors' feelings of injustice at local, national, and transnational levels, including issues like unemployment, poverty, corruption, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict [22]. The study analyzes the boundaries that actors draw between \"us\" and \"them\" at various levels (local, national, transnational), including social cleavages, ideological divides, and perceptions of the political class [22]. The research examines the impact of these factors on their participation in elections, noting different patterns of electoral behavior depending on the actors' political identities and perceptions [22]. The study explores the actors' involvement in demonstrations and sit-ins related to national and international issues, highlighting the connections between local engagement and broader political movements [22]. The research analyzes the role of neighborhood associations, noting their potential as spaces for social action, network expansion, and the emergence of alternative forms of political participation [22]. The study highlights the fluidity of political engagement and the connections between local actions and the broader political landscape [22]. The Dahir of 1958 regulates the right of associations, it was slightly modified in 2002 [22].\n\n## The Amazigh Movement and Women's Activism\n\nThe Amazigh movement's activism started in the 1960s and expanded with the inclusion of various intellectual elites and socio-professional figures from different regions, including major cities [14]. The 'Manifesto for the Recognition of the Amazigh Identity of Morocco' (بيان من أجل الاعتراف بأمازيغية المغرب ) in 2001 marked a turning point for the Amazigh movement in Morocco [14]. The الشبكة الأمازيغية من أجل المواطنة played a role in promoting the idea of creating independent women's frameworks within the Amazigh movement [14]. سيليا الزياني, an activist in حراك الريف, is mentioned as an example of an Amazigh women's movement actor [14]. The المعهد الملكي للثقافة الأمازيغية was founded in 2001 [14]. The 2011 constitution recognized Amazigh as an official language [14]. The Amazigh women's movement in Morocco combines cultural and gender aspects due to the double suffering of Amazigh women [14]. The الحركة النسائية الأمازيغية بالمغرب advocates for the integration of Amazigh women into public life while recognizing their cultural specificity [14]. The movement aims for a state of law and rights (دولة الحق والقانون) [14].\n\n## Globalization and Future Challenges\n\nGlobalization poses new challenges to Morocco, potentially exacerbating territorial fragmentation and social exclusion [31]. The reports of the Economic and Social Council of the year 2017, demonstrate weaknesses in economic and social infrastructures [12].",
