  "article_text_raw": "# The Exile of Mohammed V and the Moroccan Resistance\n\n## Background to the Exile\n\nThe French Protectorate in Morocco, established by the Treaty of Fez in 1912, significantly curtailed the power of the Sultan and the Makhzen [43]. While the Sultan remained, the French Résident Général acted as the sole intermediary between the monarch and foreign representatives [65]. This system, along with the Spanish Protectorate in the northern Rif region and parts of the south, sparked growing nationalist sentiment among Moroccans [46]. Sidi Mohammed, later known as Mohammed V, became Sultan in 1927 and emerged as a symbol of this nationalist movement [43].\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the rising tensions between the Sultan and the French authorities. The \"Berber Dahir\" of 1930, which aimed to implement customary law in Berber-speaking regions, triggered widespread protests [43, 48, 49]. The nationalist party Istiqlal (Independence) was founded in 1944 and played a central role in the fight for independence [43, 46]. During World War II, Mohammed V sided with the Allies and implicitly supported the Istiqlal party [9]. His speech in Tangier on April 10, 1947, deviated from the approved text, further straining relations with the French [9]. General Alphonse Juin aimed to force the sultan \"to submit or resign\" [9]. Thami El Glaoui, Pacha of Marrakech, was used to oppose Mohammed V [9].\n\n## The Exile and its Immediate Aftermath\n\nOn August 20, 1953, France deposed Sultan Mohammed V of Morocco [8, 9]. This action was a violation of the Treaty of Protectorate and considered sacrilegious by Muslims [35]. The French authorities removed him from his religious authority and exiled him, first to Corsica and then, in January 1954, to Antsirabe, Madagascar [8, 9]. Mohammed Ben Arafa was installed as the new 'imam' [9]. The leaders of the Moroccan national movement conditioned independence on the return of Mohammed V from exile [21].\n\nThe exile triggered a wave of nationalist violence in Morocco [25]. A popular uprising against foreign domination occurred in the Maghreb region [2]. The Moroccan people engaged in a popular rebellion and resistance against foreign domination during the colonial period [50]. The exile caused an explosion of popular anger, increased insecurity, and terrorism [35]. Nationalist violence led to 839 deaths between 1953 and 1955 [25]. The Moroccan resistance movement involved people from all levels of society who risked their lives for their country's liberation [7]. Resistance fighters were driven by patriotism and a willingness to make sacrifices [7].\n\nIn Casablanca, militant actions were undertaken by various resistance groups [27]. The song \"Khût-na yâ 1-islâm, hezzu bi-na l-'lâm\" by Bouchaïb el-Bidaoui reflected the Moroccan people's reaction to the exile [27]. The \"yaouleds\" (street children) of Casablanca participated in the riots of December 1952, protesting the inequalities of the protectorate system [59].\n\n## The Resistance Movement\n\nThe exile of Mohammed V led to greater unity within the national movement and the beginning of armed resistance [36]. The Istiqlal party and the PRN agreed to acts of sabotage in both zones of Morocco in July 1953 [15]. The National Reformist Party (PRN) played a fundamental role in the history of the national resistance [15]. Resistance cells were organized in French cities, and Moroccan immigrants contributed to financing the resistance [14]. Some Moroccans left France to join the anticolonial fight in Morocco [14].\n\nThe Tadla region also saw significant resistance [6]. An uprising started from Beni Mellal in 1915 against the French [6]. Local resistance fighters in the Beni Mellal region allied with Ait Wirra, Ait Sakhmane, and Ait Atta to obstruct the occupation of Kasbah Tadla in 1913 [6]. Mocha Ousaid led the defeat of the French in the battle of Al Qsaiba in 1913 [6]. The great resister Mouha Ouhammou Zayani defeated colonial forces in the battle of Al Hirri in Khénifra in 1914 [6].\n\nThe Spanish Protectorate also saw resistance. During the exile of Sultan Muhammad V, *al-Oumma* was the only Arabic newspaper allowed in the country [15]. It reported on the conditions of Muhammad V's exile and the activities of the Resistance and the National Liberation Army (ELN) [15].\n\n## International Pressure and Mohammed V's Return\n\nThe French authorities negotiated with Mohammed V in October 1955 due to the Moroccan crisis [8, 9]. The Conference of Aix-les-Bains recognized the necessity of Mohammed V in resolving the Moroccan situation [9]. A Moroccan delegation visited Mohammed V in Madagascar in September 1955 [9]. Thami El Glaoui pledged his allegiance to Mohammed V on October 25 [9].\n\nMohammed V was allowed to return to France in October 1955 after negotiations with the French [8, 9]. His return to Morocco triggered the process leading to Moroccan independence [8, 9]. He returned to Rabat on November 16, 1955, to a triumphant reception [65].\n\n## Independence and its Aftermath\n\nMorocco officially gained independence from France on March 2, 1956 [43]. Mohammed V declared the end of the Protectorate, while maintaining ties with France [65]. After independence, the power balance shifted towards the monarchical institution [21]. Mohammed V secured the trust of the Makhzen colonial by appointing M'Barek Bekkaï as president of the Council [19]. An alliance formed between the Palace and the rural elite during this period [19].\n\nHowever, the movement of national resistance and liberation did not install itself in power after independence [21]. The Istiqlal party aimed to become the dominant party-state but was prevented from gaining full power [19]. In 1958, an armed uprising occurred in the Rif and Middle Atlas regions, largely inhabited by Berber tribes, who accused the Istiqlal of dictatorial practices and neglect of rural areas [65].\n\nMohammed V died on February 26, 1961 [17, 65]. His death led to widespread mourning and societal changes [65]. Hassan II, his successor, worked to establish an authoritarian regime [21].\n\n## Remembering the Resistance\n\nMuseums of Resistance and the Army of Liberation in Morocco play a role in shaping national identities [10]. These museums present the recent history of the country and contribute to the construction of a specific national narrative [10]. The \"Lettre des 75,\" published in \"Maroc-Presse\" on May 11, 1954, was a call for change from a group of French liberals [35]. King Mohamed V received a group of French Liberals at the Royal Palace in Rabat in November 1955 [42].",
