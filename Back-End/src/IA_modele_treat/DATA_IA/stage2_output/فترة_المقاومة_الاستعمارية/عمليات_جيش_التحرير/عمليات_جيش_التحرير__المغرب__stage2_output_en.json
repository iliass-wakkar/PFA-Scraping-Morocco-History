  "article_text_raw": "# Operations of the Moroccan Army of Liberation: A Historical Overview\n\n## Background and Origins\n\nThe operations of the Moroccan Army of Liberation (جيش التحرير المغربي) are rooted in the complex history of Morocco's struggle for independence and the broader context of anti-colonial movements in North Africa [2, 3, 10]. The Moroccan Army of Liberation was created to achieve independence and restore Sultan Muhammad bin Yusuf to the throne after his exile [2]. The official establishment of the Moroccan Liberation Army was in Madrid in 1955 [3]. Training bases were located in the northern region, and the army maintained close ties to the Istiqlal Party [3].\n\nThe Algerian War of Liberation (1954-1962) also provides a crucial backdrop [9, 12, 14]. The Algerian Revolution was triggered by young activists within the التيار الثوري of the الحركة الوطنية الجزائرية after the المنظمة الخاصة (L’os) was dismantled by French police in March 1954 [10]. The decision for armed struggle followed the internal crisis within the الحركة الوطنية (حزب الشعب الجزائري - حركة انتصار الحريات الديمقراطية PPA-MTLD) during its second congress in April 1953 [10]. The Moroccan Liberation Army coordinated with other liberation armies in Algeria and Tunisia [3].\n\n## Ideological Divisions and Leadership\n\nInternal divisions and differing visions for the future of the Maghreb influenced the Moroccan Army of Liberation [2, 3]. Abd al-Krim al-Khattabi, a prominent figure in Moroccan history, urged continued resistance in the Rif region even after the Franco-Moroccan declaration of March 2, 1956, which recognized Morocco's independence [2]. He warned guerrilla fighters not to trust promises and to continue armed struggle as long as any French presence remained in Morocco [2]. This contrasted with Sultan Muhammad V's call for a ceasefire to allow independence negotiations to conclude [2]. This created a conflict in authority within the Moroccan Army of Liberation [2].\n\nMuhammad ibn Abd al-Karim al-Khattabi envisioned a unified \"Army of Liberation of the Arab Maghreb\" [3]. He supported the complete independence of the Arab Maghreb and the creation of a single state in the Greater Maghreb [3]. He feared that the independence of Tunisia and Morocco would come at the political cost of solidifying French control over Algeria [3]. The Moroccan Liberation Army had two command structures: one based in Tetouan focusing on Moroccan independence and coordinating with other liberation armies in Algeria and Tunisia, and the other in Cairo, led by al-Khattabi, considering itself the \"Army of Liberation of the Arab Maghreb\" [3].\n\nA document attributed to al-Khattabi, dated June 2, 1956, accused the Istiqlal Party of fascist tendencies and of diverting the Moroccan Liberation Army from its true mission [3]. The Istiqlal Party was accused of using the Moroccan Liberation Army in internal conflicts against nationalists who did not share their views [3]. Allal al-Fassi, leader of the Istiqlal Party, was critical of the negotiations for independence, deeming it incomplete and demanding the restoration of all Moroccan territories [3].\n\n## Operations and Conflicts\n\nThe Moroccan Army of Liberation engaged in various operations, including those in Ifni and the Sahara [47, 51, 53, 54]. The Ifni-Sahara War (1957-1958) began with attacks by Moroccan independentist forces in Sidi Ifni on November 23, 1957 [47, 48]. The Spanish forces suffered initial casualties [47]. The Ejército de Liberación (EL), a Moroccan Army of Liberation, played a significant role in the events of 1956-1958 [53]. The EL initially infiltrated Ifni and Sahara with the apparent tacit consent of the Spanish administration [53]. Later, the Spanish authorities collaborated with the French in \"Operation Ecouvillon/Teide\" (February 1958) to expel the EL [41, 53]. The EL launched an attack on Ifni on November 23, 1957 [53]. Spain lost 48 men in the combat of Edchera on January 13, 1958 [53]. The region of Tarfaya was ceded to Morocco with the treaty of Cintra on April 10, 1958 [53].\n\nThe French army also engaged in operations against the Armée de Libération (AL) in Mauritania [41]. Operation Écouvillon, a joint French-Spanish operation, pushed the AL north of Seguiet el Hamra [41]. The AL's losses in Operation Écouvillon included 132 killed, 37 wounded and 51 prisoners; French forces reported 7 killed and 25 wounded [41].\n\nThe article \"Algérie et Droit international\" by Maurice Flory, discusses the Algerian War and its international legal implications [31]. It begins by describing the initial attacks on October 31st-November 1st, 1954 in Algeria [31]. Initially, these attacks were perceived as internal disturbances, but the situation evolved significantly over five years [31]. The United Nations began to address Algeria, and the Armée de Libération Nationale (ALN) became organized and powerful enough to challenge French pacification efforts [31].\n\n## The Rif Rebellion (1958-1959)\n\nThe Rif Rebellion of 1958-1959, two years after Morocco's independence, saw the Rif tribes rise up against the Moroccan government [55]. Abdelkrím el Jattabi was involved in the conflict [55]. The French government, under De Gaulle, was also involved [55]. Spain was accused of protecting the Rif rebels, who threatened both the stability of the new Moroccan regime and French dominance in Algeria [55].\n\n## External Influences and Support\n\nThe Algerian Revolution relied on external support for armament between 1954-1962, especially during the period of 1958-1961 [7]. The Algerian-Tunisian border served as a crucial entry point for weapons and supplies to the ALN during the Algerian Revolution [7]. The ALN established logistical networks and storage facilities along the Algerian-Tunisian border, supported by the Tunisian government [7]. The ALN received material support from various countries, including Egypt, Iraq, China, and the Soviet Union, to help arm the revolution [7].\n\nThe United States also played a role in Morocco during this period [40]. The United States supported French political projects in Morocco to prevent German presence on the Atlantic coast during the Conference of Algeciras in April 1906 [40]. American forces landed in Morocco in 1942 as part of the North African landings during World War II [40]. Agreements between Darlan and Clark in November 1942 led to the French army's unconditional surrender in Morocco, giving General Eisenhower control [40]. The US supported France in Morocco due to Cold War strategic considerations, despite initial concerns about regional security [40].\n\n## Aftermath and Legacy\n\nFollowing Morocco's independence on March 2, 1956, the Moroccan government refused to recognize the agreements made between the US and France regarding American military bases [40]. Direct negotiations began between the US and Morocco in May 1957 regarding the bases [40]. The American military presence contributed to the weakening of France's position in Morocco [40].\n\nThe legacy of the Moroccan Army of Liberation is complex and multifaceted, encompassing themes of nationalism, anti-colonialism, internal conflict, and regional power dynamics [2, 3, 14]. The goals of the national liberation revolution are to achieve national independence and establish a social democratic state within the framework of Islamic principles and respect for all fundamental freedoms without ethnic or religious discrimination in addition to achieving North Africa’s unity in its natural Arab and Islamic framework [20].",
