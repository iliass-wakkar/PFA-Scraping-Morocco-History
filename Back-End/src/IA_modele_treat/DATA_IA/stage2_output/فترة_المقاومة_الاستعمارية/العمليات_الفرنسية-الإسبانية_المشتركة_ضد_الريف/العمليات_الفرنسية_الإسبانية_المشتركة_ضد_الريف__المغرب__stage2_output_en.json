  "article_text_raw": "# The Franco-Spanish Joint Operations Against the Rif (Morocco)\n\n## Background to Colonial Involvement in Morocco\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, European powers engaged in intense competition for colonial territories in Africa [24, 43]. Spain, seeking to regain international prestige after its defeat in 1898 and the loss of Cuba, the Philippines, and Puerto Rico, aimed to participate in the colonization of Morocco [7, 8, 11, 43]. Spain's foreign policy prioritized the security of its national territory [11]. However, Spain's ambitions were challenged by other European powers, particularly France, which sought to establish a dominant presence in the region [3, 28, 29, 56]. Great Britain also sought to prevent French dominance near the Strait of Gibraltar [16].\n\nThe Madrid Conference of 1880 addressed the question of Morocco's partition but deferred a decision [11, 31]. France pursued a policy of \"peaceful penetration\" after 1900, aiming to exert influence over the Sultan through technical, financial, and military assistance [11]. The Anglo-French Declaration of April 8, 1904, recognized French pre-eminence in Morocco and British support for a Spanish presence in western Morocco [11]. The Franco-Spanish Declaration of October 3, 1904, and the secret Franco-Spanish Convention of the same date, demarcated the Spanish sphere of influence in the Rif region of northern Morocco [11]. Germany's opposition to these agreements led to the Algeciras Conference in 1906 [11, 16].\n\nThe Algeciras Conference aimed to resolve imperial rivalries over Morocco [16]. The Act of Algeciras created a de facto Franco-Spanish protectorate under vague international control [11]. The Spanish Socialist Party (PSOE) opposed colonial wars and called for Moroccan independence [16]. In 1912, the Spanish sphere of influence became the Spanish Protectorate under a Franco-Spanish Convention of November 27, 1912 [11, 20, 40, 51]. This agreement consolidated French supremacy in Morocco [29]. France controlled the central and southern parts of Morocco, while Spain controlled a northern zone and several Saharan enclaves [20]. The Moroccan government ceded military, diplomatic, and financial affairs to France and Spain [20].\n\n## The Rif War and Spanish Difficulties\n\nThe Rif War, beginning in 1921, strained Spain's resources [28, 29, 43]. Abd el-Krim al-Khattabi emerged as a leader of the Riffan tribes, aiming to overthrow Spanish domination in the Rif [8, 13]. The defeat at Annual in 1921 highlighted the vulnerability of the Spanish Army in Morocco [8, 28, 29, 32, 43]. The Spanish defeat at Annoual resulted in the death of approximately 9,000 Spanish soldiers [28, 29]. The Rif region was the first country founded after a successful war of decolonization [13].\n\nThe Spanish colonial system faced numerous challenges, including difficult terrain, resistance from the Rifian tribes, and internal disputes within the Spanish army [43, 51]. The quality of Spanish troops was poor, with an outdated army structure and an unequal conscription system [43]. The \"blocao\" system, involving hastily constructed fortified posts, was poorly planned and inadequately supplied [43]. The Rifian forces employed brutal tactics, contributing to the high death toll among Spanish soldiers [43].\n\n## Primo de Rivera's Dictatorship and Collaboration with France\n\nThe coup d'état of General Miguel Primo de Rivera on September 13, 1923, aimed to resolve the colonial war in Morocco [4, 8, 12, 28, 56]. One of the motives for the new government was to correct the unfavorable course of the colonial war in Morocco [12]. Primo de Rivera initially considered abandoning Morocco due to the unpopularity of the campaigns and the army's limited capabilities [50, 51]. However, he eventually decided to engage in military collaboration with France [29, 50, 51].\n\nMarshal Pétain played a crucial role in changing the French attitude, leading to the defeat of Abd-el-Krim [29, 30, 37, 38]. In September 1925, a successful Franco-Spanish pincer offensive was launched on Alhucemas Bay and south of the Rif mountains [12]. This offensive resulted in the defeat of the rebels in Morocco [12]. Following the victory in Morocco, Primo de Rivera replaced the military directorate with a civilian one [12].\n\n## The Alhucemas Landing and the Defeat of Abd el-Krim\n\nThe Franco-Spanish alliance against the Rif movement was prepared from May 1925 onwards [38]. Negotiations between France and Spain, led by figures such as General Primo de Rivera and Marshal Pétain, resulted in agreements for joint military projects aimed at suppressing the Rif resistance [37, 38]. France's entry into the conflict in 1925 significantly altered the balance of power [37, 38].\n\nThe Spanish landing at Cebadilla was supported by intensive shelling from the fleet, allowing General Fernández Pérez to land starting September 10 [38]. French naval forces intensely bombarded Rif defenses on the coast during the Spanish landing [38]. On October 1, 1925, Spanish troops took Axdir [38].\n\nThe final agreement was signed in Madrid on February 6, 1926, defining the cooperation between Spain and France in northern Morocco [38]. The Madrid agreement entailed the joint attack to the Beni Uriaguel massif, in order to reduce Abd el-Krim forces [38]. Abd el-Krim surrendered to the French in May 1926 [21, 38]. After Abd-el-Krim surrender was made the offensive actions by the colonial armies happened very fast [38].\n\n## Aftermath and Legacy\n\nAfter the Rif War, Spanish forces continued to pacify their zone, with French assistance for border posts [50, 51]. By mid-1927, near-total pacification was achieved [50, 51]. The Rif War had a significant impact on Spanish politics and society [4, 48, 56]. The war also influenced the strategic planning of Vichy France in Morocco during World War II [2].\n\nThe Spanish Minor Sovereign Territories, such as the Chafarinas Islands and the Alhucemas Islands, played a role in the conflict and its aftermath [18, 19]. The Rif War's conclusion in 1927 contributed to the civilian depopulation of these territories [18, 19].\n\nThe Franco-Spanish joint operations against the Rif marked a significant chapter in the history of European colonialism in North Africa [9, 14, 25]. The conflict highlighted the complex relationships between European powers and the challenges of maintaining control over colonial territories [10, 41]. The Rif War also contributed to the rise of Moroccan nationalism and the eventual independence of Morocco in 1956 [22, 24, 25, 39, 42, 44].",
