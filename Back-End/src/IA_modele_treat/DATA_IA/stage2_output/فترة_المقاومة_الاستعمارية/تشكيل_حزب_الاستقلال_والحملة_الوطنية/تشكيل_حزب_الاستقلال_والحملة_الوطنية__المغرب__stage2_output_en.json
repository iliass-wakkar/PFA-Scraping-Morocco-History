  "article_text_raw": "# The Formation of the Istiqlal Party and the Moroccan National Campaign\n\n## Background: Colonial Morocco and the Rise of Nationalism\n\nIn the early 20th century, Morocco was subjected to increasing European influence, culminating in the Treaty of Fez on March 30, 1912, which established a Franco-Spanish protectorate [25, 41, 90]. This treaty divided Morocco into zones of influence, with France controlling the majority of the territory and Spain administering the northern and southern regions [90, 38]. The Algeciras Conference of 1906 had already recognized the rights of both Spain and France to exert influence in Morocco [15, 226]. The establishment of the protectorate, however, did not occur without resistance. The Berber tribes, in particular, mounted a strong opposition, besieging French forces in Fez in April 1912 [145]. The Rif War (1921-1926), led by Abd el-Krim al-Khattabi, further demonstrated the strength of Moroccan resistance to colonial rule [17, 145, 49].\n\nDespite the imposition of the protectorate, a sense of Moroccan national identity began to coalesce. This was fueled by several factors, including the influence of European ideologies, the growth of an educated elite, and the desire to preserve Moroccan culture and traditions [15, 17, 32, 39, 45]. The Berber Dahir of 1930, which aimed to regulate Berber customary law and remove Berber tribes from Muslim law, sparked widespread protests and is often seen as a key turning point in the development of Moroccan nationalism [18, 45, 17, 32]. The Comité d’Action Marocaine (CAM), created in 1934, emerged as the first overtly nationalist party, advocating for reforms and a stricter application of the Protectorate regime [18, 25, 64, 41]. The CAM, led by figures like Allal al-Fasi, Mohamed Bel Hassan El Ouazzani, and Ahmed Balafrej, sought to abolish direct administration practices [64]. However, the French authorities dissolved the CAM, and internal divisions led to its fragmentation [64].\n\n## The Founding of the Istiqlal Party\n\nThe intensified nationalist sentiment during World War II led to the formation of the Istiqlal (Independence) Party in 1943 [2, 4, 24, 25, 41, 51, 64]. The Istiqlal Party emerged as an umbrella group of Moroccans fighting for independence from France [4]. It comprised members from different sections of Moroccan society, including the traditional middle class from northern cities like Fez, the grand bourgeoisie, and intellectuals [24]. Key figures in the Istiqlal Party included Ahmed Balafrej and Allal al-Fassi [29, 41, 17]. The party's formation was influenced by the Moroccan Action Committee [18].\n\n## The National Campaign and the Independence Manifesto\n\nThe Istiqlal Party's first public act was the \"Independence Manifesto\" on January 11, 1944 [24, 51, 28]. The Independence Manifesto, approved by the sultan, called for Moroccan independence and the establishment of a democratic regime under the Sultan's leadership, similar to Muslim countries in the east [24]. The manifesto, signed by prominent nationalist leaders, demanded full freedom for Morocco under Sultan Muhammad Ben Yussuf (Muhamad V) [25, 41]. The Istiqlal Party aimed to establish a British-style monarchy in Morocco where the sovereign reigns but does not rule [24]. The publication of the manifesto led to the arrest of several nationalist leaders, further galvanizing the independence movement [41, 83, 104].\n\n## Sultan Muhammad Ibn Yusuf and the Growing National Movement\n\nSultan Muhammad Ibn Yusuf (later King Mohammed V) gradually emerged as a key figure in the national movement [1, 2, 25, 41]. Initially, the Sultan had signed a dahir forbidding Moroccans from forming unions, viewing them as a threat to the Makhzen's authority [6]. However, after the war, the Sultan began to express support for the nationalist cause [25]. A pivotal moment occurred in April 1947 when Muhammed Ibn Yusuf visited Tanger, demonstrating the unity of Morocco and demanding independence [1, 25]. In his speech of April 9, 1947, in Tanger, the Sultan expressed his regret for the backwardness of the country and encouraged his compatriots to learn modern techniques, expressing confidence in their political awakening and the reclaiming of their rights [1]. The Sultan's Tanger speech in 1947 is considered a milestone, marking his explicit joining of the forces struggling for national development and freedom [1].\n\n## French Repression and Continued Struggle\n\nThe growing nationalist movement and the Sultan's increasing support for it prompted a harsh response from the French authorities [1]. General Alphonse Juin was appointed as resident general, restricting the activity of the nationalists and enforcing their leaders to leave the country [1]. The French governor rejected the Moroccan sultan's support for the independence of Morocco in 1951 [25]. In 1953, the French deposed Sultan Mohammed V, exiling him to Corsica and later Madagascar [24, 25, 41, 68, 112]. The French replaced him with Arafat [25]. This act sparked widespread protests and resistance, further strengthening the nationalist movement and solidifying the Sultan's image as a symbol of Moroccan unity [24, 41, 68, 112]. The Istiqlal Party continued to operate, seeking international support and advocating for the territorial integrity of Morocco [1]. The Istiqlal opened the Moroccan Informational Bureau in New York at the end of 1947 [1]. The Istiqlal sent a memorandum to the U.N. at the end of 1947, arguing that the Moroccan nation was a coherent political system before the French arrival, making the protectorate illegal [1].\n\n## Independence and the Aftermath\n\nFaced with growing pressure and the Algerian War, France eventually agreed to negotiate Morocco's independence [5, 25, 41, 112]. Morocco gained independence on November 18, 1956, ending 44 years of French occupation [5]. Sultan Muhammad Ben Yussuf (Muhamad V) returned in 1954 [25]. Morocco gained independence on November 18, 1956, due to the combined efforts of the Monarchy and the Istiqlal [5]. The Istiqlal became critical of the monarchy after independence, believing they deserved to be in power [5]. After independence, the title of 'Sultan' was replaced by 'King' [24].\n\nThe years following independence were marked by political instability and power struggles [5]. King Mohammed V nominated a consultative assembly to assist in governing the nation in 1956 [41]. The Istiqlal party was invited to form a government two years after independence but faced numerous restrictions [41]. Internal divisions within the Istiqlal between the left wing led by Mehdi Ben Barka and the right wing led by Allal-el Fessie weakened the party [5]. The Istiqlal mainly appealed to the urban middle class, limiting its overall support base [5]. The Istiqlal split in 1958 over the issue of American military bases in Morocco [5]. In January 1959, Prime Minister Abdallah Ibrahim formed a new-left wing party called the national union popular forces (UNFP) [25]. The USFP is the successor of the “Union Nationale des Forces Populaires” (UNFP) which was created in January 1959 following internal division in the Istiqlal Party [4].\n\nKing Mohammed V established a national police force and Royal Armed Forces (FAR) in May 1956, shifting control of key state apparatuses away from political parties [5]. Mohamed Laghzaoui, a key financial sponsor of the Istiqlal, sided with the monarchy and became the director of national security and the head of the police [5]. Abedlekrim el Khatib and Mahjoubi Aherdane, leading figures of the ALM, established the Popular Movement party, further damaging the Istiqlal's support base [5]. The Istiqlal banned the PDI newspaper and was implicated in the assassination of Abbes Messaadi, a leader of the ALM [5].\n\nBy 1962, the monarchy succeeded in constructing a new constitution, solidifying its power [5]. The Istiqlal's use of violent and repressive tactics contributed to their loss of power [5]. The postcolonial Moroccan state was established in 1955 with the aim of creating a weak multiparty system and a powerful monarchy [12].\n\n## The Istiqlal Party in Later Years\n\nDespite the initial power struggles, the Istiqlal Party remained a significant force in Moroccan politics [4, 11, 23, 29, 44, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 63, 70, 73, 79, 84, 87, 88, 95, 111, 118, 121, 123, 124, 130, 131, 135, 137, 138, 139, 141, 144, 154, 157, 161, 164, 165, 170, 173, 175, 177, 184, 186, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 203, 204, 207, 209, 210, 215, 216, 217, 218, 219, 220, 221, 223, 224, 225, 226, 227, 229, 230, 233, 234, 235, 237, 238, 239, 240, 241, 242, 243, 244, 245, 246, 247, 248, 249]. In 1993, the Istiqlal party became part of the democratic bloc “Koutla” and was part of the new government of 1997 [4]. In March 1998, the Istiqlal party participated in a coalition government, headed by Abd al-Rahman Yussufi (USFP), marking the first time since 1960 that the monarchy entrusted authority to opposition parties in forming a government [44]. In the 2007 elections, the Istiqlal Party took first place with 10.7% of votes and 15.9% of seats [11]. In the 2011 elections, Istiqlal won 61 seats and became the second largest party [4]. In 2021 the party won 81 seats in the parliamentary elections and is in a government coalition with the RNI and PAM [4]. The USFP is the successor of the “Union Nationale des Forces Populaires” (UNFP) which was created in January 1959 following internal division in the Istiqlal Party [4].",
