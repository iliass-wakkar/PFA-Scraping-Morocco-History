  "article_text_raw": "# Portuguese Expansion Along the Atlantic Coast\n\n## Early Motivations and Foundations\n\nThe Portuguese expansion along the Atlantic coast began in the 15th century, driven by a complex interplay of economic, religious, and political factors [11, 12, 18, 26, 28, 59, 65, 70, 75, 88, 104, 111, 126]. A primary motivation was the desire to find new trade routes to the East, bypassing the established routes controlled by the Arab and Ottoman Empires [12, 67]. This quest was fueled by the increasing European demand for spices and luxury goods [51, 104]. The Portuguese also sought access to African gold and slaves [1, 9, 13, 14, 18, 24, 34, 35, 58, 59, 63, 67, 75, 88, 104, 111]. Religious zeal, particularly the desire to spread Christianity and combat Muslim influence, provided further impetus for exploration and conquest [24, 29, 39, 59, 70, 104, 126, 141].\n\nPortugal's geographical location, with its long Atlantic coastline, provided a natural advantage for maritime exploration [3, 20, 44, 45, 62, 100]. The Portuguese Crown invested heavily in navigational tools, shipbuilding, and pilot training, leading to significant advancements in maritime technology [11, 22, 25, 65, 67, 100]. Key figures like Prince Henry the Navigator played a crucial role in promoting and funding expeditions [6, 12, 17, 53, 59, 64, 90, 100, 104, 122, 137].\n\n## Exploration and Colonization of the Atlantic Islands\n\nThe Portuguese expansion initially focused on exploring and colonizing the Atlantic islands [1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 15, 19, 23, 24, 28, 34, 35, 48, 53, 56, 62, 75, 81, 86, 90, 104, 111, 119, 126]. Madeira was discovered in 1417, followed by the Azores in 1427 [59, 90]. These islands, initially uninhabited, became important centers for sugar cane cultivation, requiring significant labor [6, 18, 35, 39, 62, 75, 81, 90, 104]. The Portuguese also settled the Azores from the 1430s [28]. The colonization of Santiago in Cape Verde began in 1462, with Fogo colonized later [24]. These islands served as crucial hubs for trade and navigation in the Atlantic [24, 47, 63, 115, 119].\n\nThe settlement of the Azores occurred in 1466 when the islands were given to the Duchess of Burgundy, who sent people and resources from Flanders to inhabit them [53]. By 1490, the Azores were inhabited by thousands of people [53].\n\n## Expansion Along the African Coast\n\nAs the Portuguese gained experience in Atlantic navigation, they began to explore the African coast [2, 6, 12, 15, 18, 19, 24, 28, 47, 50, 54, 58, 59, 61, 63, 67, 70, 73, 75, 85, 86, 90, 97, 100, 104, 110, 111, 119, 126, 133, 134, 137, 147, 156]. Gil Eanes crossed Cape Bojador in 1434, a feat that opened the way for further exploration southward [19, 59, 67, 75, 85, 90, 126, 137]. By 1460, the Portuguese had explored the western African coast as far as Sierra Leone [24]. They established trading posts (feitorias) along the coast, exchanging European goods for African products such as gold, ivory, and slaves [13, 14, 18, 47, 58, 59, 63, 67, 75, 97, 100, 111, 126]. Elmina, established in 1482, became a major trading post on the Gold Coast [58, 59, 75, 90].\n\nThe Portuguese sought to control the Moroccan territory, access the gold trade, and combat Muslim corsairs [70]. They captured Ceuta in 1415, marking the beginning of Portuguese colonial expansion [59, 70, 75, 86, 90, 104, 126, 134, 137]. They occupied coastal cities, including Al-Qasr al-Saghir (1458), Anfa (1469), Asilah (1471), Safi (1508), and Azemmour (1513) [70].\n\nThe Portuguese also sought to establish a monopoly on European coastal and riverine activities, but faced challenges from the French, English, and Dutch [24].\n\n## The Slave Trade and its Impact\n\nThe Portuguese expansion along the Atlantic coast was inextricably linked to the development of the transatlantic slave trade [1, 9, 10, 13, 14, 18, 34, 35, 59, 61, 63, 67, 68, 75, 78, 88, 97, 101, 104, 111, 114, 119, 126, 133, 134, 135, 137, 138, 142]. The Portuguese were the first to engage in the large-scale trade of enslaved Africans, transporting them to Europe, the Atlantic islands, and eventually, Brazil [35, 59, 75, 101, 111]. The establishment of sugar plantations in São Tomé and later in Brazil created a high demand for slave labor [6, 9, 18, 35, 39, 59, 75, 104, 111, 122].\n\nThe slave trade had a profound impact on African societies, leading to depopulation, social disruption, and the rise of new power structures [1, 18, 58, 59, 75, 104]. Some African societies resisted the slave trade, leading to conflicts with the Portuguese [24, 35, 60, 75]. The Portuguese Crown attempted to regulate the slave trade, but faced resistance from merchants and traders [14].\n\nThe article \"Financing the Luso-Atlantic Slave Trade, 1500–1840\" highlights the collective investment practices employed by Portuguese merchants, particularly in Salvador da Bahia, to facilitate the slave trade [13, 14]. These practices, rooted in medieval Mediterranean precedents, allowed for the participation of a diverse range of stakeholders, including merchants, mariners (both free and enslaved), and other residents of Bahia [13, 14].\n\n## Brazil and the South Atlantic System\n\nThe accidental discovery of Brazil by Pedro Álvares Cabral in 1500 marked a new phase in Portuguese expansion [59, 64, 100, 111, 122]. While initially of less interest than the spice trade in the East, Brazil eventually became the cornerstone of the Portuguese empire [9, 16, 19, 29, 39, 40, 64, 72, 78, 87, 103, 107, 111, 116, 122, 139]. The establishment of sugar plantations, fueled by African slave labor, transformed Brazil into a major economic power [9, 16, 39, 59, 75, 111, 122].\n\nThe Portuguese colonization of Brazil involved adapting to tropical conditions, relying on indigenous crops like manioc and maize [9]. Sugarcane, coffee, and cocoa became key plantation products [9]. The Portuguese utilized African slavery for labor, and foods consumed in Brazil included many of African origin [9].\n\nThe article \"An Expanding Mercantile Circuit in the South Atlantic in the Late Colonial Period (1796-1821)\" examines the commercial links between port cities on the coast of Portuguese America and the River Plate estuary [30]. The establishment of the Royal Court in Rio de Janeiro in 1808 formalized pre-existing economic relationships [30].\n\n## Competition and Conflict\n\nThe Portuguese expansion along the Atlantic coast was not without its challenges and conflicts [2, 10, 16, 18, 47, 55, 58, 60, 70, 75, 82, 86, 98, 100, 103, 110, 111, 116, 123, 124, 133, 137, 142, 153]. The Spanish, Dutch, English, and French all sought to challenge Portuguese dominance in the Atlantic [2, 10, 16, 18, 24, 47, 58, 60, 70, 75, 82, 98, 100, 103, 110, 111, 116, 123, 124, 133, 137, 142, 153]. The Dutch, in particular, emerged as a major rival, challenging Portuguese control in Africa, Asia, and Brazil [2, 10, 16, 47, 58, 98].\n\nThe Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494 divided the Atlantic basin between Spain and Portugal, but this agreement did not prevent ongoing conflicts and competition [18, 28, 54, 59, 64, 69, 70, 86, 90, 100, 123, 124]. The Dutch revolt against Spanish rule also impacted the Portuguese, as Spain ruled Portugal during the Iberian Union [10, 16, 25, 47, 52, 61, 72, 87, 103, 107, 112, 142, 145].\n\n## The Legacy of Portuguese Expansion\n\nThe Portuguese expansion along the Atlantic coast had a lasting impact on both Portugal and the regions it touched [1, 2, 6, 9, 11, 18, 19, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 31, 33, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158]. It transformed Portugal into a major maritime power, contributing to its wealth and influence [6, 23, 26, 51, 58, 65, 81, 100, 111, 116, 122]. It also led to the development of new trade networks, the exchange of goods and ideas, and the creation of new societies in the Americas [1, 9, 18, 26, 31, 39, 40, 43, 51, 56, 59, 64, 67, 72, 75, 78, 81, 87, 88, 97, 100, 103, 104, 107, 111, 116, 117, 119, 122, 125, 138, 139, 142]. However, it also resulted in the exploitation and enslavement of millions of Africans, leaving a lasting legacy of inequality and injustice [1, 9, 10, 13, 14, 18, 34, 35, 58, 59, 61, 63, 67, 68, 75, 78, 88, 97, 101, 104, 111, 114, 119, 126, 133, 134, 135, 137, 138, 142].\n\nThe Portuguese language, culture, and institutions spread to Brazil and other parts of the Atlantic world [1, 23, 24, 33, 35, 39, 40, 59, 64, 72, 78, 87, 103, 107, 116, 117, 122, 138, 139, 142, 146]. The Portuguese also contributed to the development of cartography, navigation, and shipbuilding, leaving a lasting mark on maritime history [11, 17, 22, 25, 64, 65, 69, 76, 100, 107, 132, 144].",
