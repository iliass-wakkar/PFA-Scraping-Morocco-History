  "article_text_raw": "# The Rise of the Marinid Dynasty\n\n## Origins and Early Expansion\n\nThe Marinids (Bani Marin) were a Zenata Berber tribe originating from the central Maghreb, specifically the region between Tlemcen and Tahar [17]. They were initially nomadic tribes from the Zab region, located on the border between modern Algeria and Tunisia [29]. From the early 13th century onwards, they began to expand their influence in the Maghreb [29]. Their initial expansion was largely driven by plunder, and unlike the Almoravids and Almohads, they lacked a strong unifying religious or political ideology [29].\n\n## Conflict with the Almohads and Seizure of Power\n\nThe Marinids emerged as major competitors to the Almohad state, gradually undermining their rule for over 58 years [17]. The decline of the Almohad empire, particularly following the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212, and internal conflicts among Almohad claimants facilitated the Marinids' rise to power [29]. Abu Bakr Yahya bin Abdul Haq al-Marini entered Fez in 642 AH/1248 CE, marking the beginning of Marinid rule in that city [17]. The Marinids systematically conquered the Maghreb al-Aksa (modern Morocco) over several decades, capturing important cities such as Fes and Meknes [29]. Prince Yaqoub bin Abdul Haq seized Marrakech, the Almohad capital, in 668 AH/1269 CE, effectively ending the Almohad state in the Maghreb [17]. After the decline of the Almohad Empire, the Marinids emerged as one of three successor dynasties in 1258 [38].\n\n## Consolidation of Power and Governance\n\nThe Marinids established Fes as their capital [23, 25]. The Marinid sultan Abū Yūsuf began construction of Fas al-Djedid (New Fes) in March 1276 [23, 25]. The Marinids' governance style was characterized by a reliance on tribal structures and alliances, with notable families and clients holding significant power within the state [29]. They strategically avoided major engagement in al-Andalus, focusing instead on controlling the Maghreb al-Aksa and eventually expanding eastwards [29].\n\nThe Marinids promoted Malikism and fostered relationships with the Sharifian lineage to bolster their legitimacy [29]. Their economic power stemmed largely from the control of trans-Saharan trade routes and the exploitation of resources in regions like the Fazaz (Middle Atlas Mountains) [29].\n\n## Strategic Alliances and Conflicts\n\nThe Marinids' relationship with other dynasties was complex, marked by alliances and conflicts with the Hafsids, Abd al-Wadids, and Almohads [29]. 'Abd el Hakk, the founder of the Marinid dynasty, granted Debdou and its region to the Marinid tribe Beni Ourtajjin to protect the kingdom's eastern border from the Abd el Wadides of Tlemcen [21]. Incessant battles occurred between the Marinids and Abd el Wadides during this period [21]. Recurring conflicts between the Zayyanids and the Marinids, motivated by commercial rivalry over Sijilmassa, occurred between 646/1248 and 668/1269 [30].\n\n## The Marinids and Al-Andalus\n\nAlfonso XI of Castile and León (1312-1350) fought wars against the invading Marinids, contributing to the consolidation of Castilian power [4]. Gil Álvarez Carrillo de Albornoz, a Spanish cardinal, fought against a Marinid invasion from Morocco at the Battle of Río Salado in 1340 [18, 36]. He also led the armed levy of his archbishopric at the taking of Algeciras in 1344 [18].\n\n## Marinid Culture and Architecture\n\nThe Marinid era, lasting over two centuries, is described as a time of intellectual, scientific, and economic prosperity in the Maghreb [17]. Marinid sultans constructed numerous madrasas in Fes, showcasing Hispano-Moorish architecture, including the Madrassa al-Saffarin, Madrassa al-Sabaiyn, Madrassa al-Attarin, and Madrassa Bou Inaniya [23, 25]. The Qarawiyyin Mosque's Dar al-Muwaqqit in Fes was added by the Marinids in 1286 during renovations of the mosque's minaret [6]. Water clocks were commissioned by Marinid Sultan Abu Yusuf Ya'qub in the 13th century and designed by Muhammad ibn al-Habbak [6]. Another water clock was constructed on the orders of Sultan Abu Said in 1317 and restored in 1346 [6]. The Marinids also contributed to the architectural heritage of Tlemcen, Algeria, with rich polychromic expressions found in geometric and floral shapes decorating minarets, porches, interior courtyards, and patios of buildings [3, 8].\n\n## Marinid Social Welfare Policies\n\nThe Marinid period saw a qualitative shift in social services, with the construction of schools, Koranic schools, hospitals, and care homes for the poor [17]. Sultan Ya`qub ibn Abd al-Haqq (656-685 AH / 1258-1286 CE) established monthly salaries for servants and the needy, funded by Jewish tribute, and provided daily food and dirhams to orphans [17]. Sultan Abu Saeed Othman (710-732 AH / 1310-1331 AD) abolished taxes and pardoned prisoners (except those guilty of serious crimes); he gave alms to the poor and visited the sick and funerals [17].\n\n## Marinid Patronage of Waqf Institutions\n\nThe Marinid period saw significant developments in the quantity and quality management of waqf properties [13]. All waqf properties in Fes during the Marinid period were dedicated to the Qarawiyyin Mosque, including hotels, bakeries, soap factories, leather factories, rental houses, stalls, schools, libraries, hospitals, and water suppliers [13]. The Marinids promoted waqf as part of their political agenda, leading to its spread beyond Fes to cities like Taza, Marrakech, Sale, and Septah [13].\n\n## Marinid Decline\n\nInternal conflicts and power struggles within the Marinid dynasty weakened their hold on power, ultimately leading to their downfall [29]. The death of Sultan ‘Abd al-Ḥaqq al-Marīnī in 869 AH/1465 CE marked a turning point in the Marinid rule [9]. The Banu Wattas, a powerful client family of the Marinids, eventually seized control in Fes, marking the end of the Marinid dynasty in 1472 [29].",
