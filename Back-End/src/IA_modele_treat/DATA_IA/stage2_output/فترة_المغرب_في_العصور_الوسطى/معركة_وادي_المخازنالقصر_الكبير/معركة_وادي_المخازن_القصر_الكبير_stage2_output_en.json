This battle was a pivotal event with far-reaching consequences for both Portugal and Morocco, significantly altering the geopolitical landscape of North Africa and Europe [4]. The battle occurred in the context of the late 16th century, a period marked by the rise of the Ottoman Empire and religious conflicts [8].\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the outbreak of the battle. King Sebastian of Portugal, born in Lisbon on January 20, 1554, inherited the Portuguese crown at the young age of three in 1557 [2]. His ten-year reign was largely focused on reviving territorial conquests in Africa [2]. Sebastian, driven by religious fervor and a desire for military glory, sought to expand Portuguese influence in North Africa, contrasting with his grandfather's more cautious approach [8]. He viewed the expedition as a new crusade [27].\n\nInternal political conflicts within Morocco also played a crucial role [8]. The Saadi dynasty was embroiled in a power struggle between Abd al-Malik and his nephew, the deposed King Mulei Mohammed [8]. Mulei Mohammed sought Portuguese assistance to regain his throne, providing King Sebastian with a pretext for intervention [8, 20].\n\n## Preparations and Military Forces\n\nKing Sebastian's reign saw significant military reforms in Portugal, drawing inspiration from Spanish and Italian models [4]. The Portuguese army consisted of approximately 9,000 men, fewer than the planned 12,000 due to recruitment difficulties [4]. The army's battle formation was a modified square, adapted to the terrain and circumstances [4]. On June 24, 1578, Sebastian's forces, numbering around 20,000, set sail from Lisbon to Morocco [20].\n\nThe Saadi dynasty of Morocco, under Abd al-Malik, had a well-organized army influenced by Ottoman military tactics [4]. The Ottoman Empire significantly influenced the military organization and tactics of the Saadi army [4]. The Saadi army's formation mirrored Ottoman tactics, with infantry in the center and cavalry on the flanks [4]. Abd al-Malik's army utilized significant artillery, including pieces cast under his personal supervision [4]. The Saadi army included diverse troops: Andalusians, Gazulas, Azuagos, Sharquis, and renegades [4].\n\nKing Philip II of Spain pledged military aid to Sebastian, promising 5,000 soldiers and 50 ships, but only delivered 2,000 soldiers [20].\n\n## The Battle and its Outcome\n\nThe Portuguese army marched inland to Alcácer Quibir, arriving on August 3, 1578 [20]. The Battle of Alcácer Quibir took place on August 4, 1578, resulting in a decisive Portuguese defeat [4, 20]. The initial Portuguese attack was successful, pushing back the Saadi forces and almost capturing Abd al-Malik [4]. However, a premature retreat by a section of the Portuguese army triggered a reversal of fortune [4].\n\nAbd al-Malik died during the battle, but his commanders concealed his death to maintain morale [4]. King Sebastian fought bravely throughout the battle, sustaining wounds that ultimately led to his death after the main battle [4]. King Sebastian's death was confirmed by various accounts, including those of his companions [4]. The battle resulted in a tragic defeat for the Christians, with 6,000-8,000 dead and around 8,000 prisoners [2]. Three monarchs died in the Battle of Alcácer Quibir: King Sebastian of Portugal, Abd al-Malik, and Mulei Mohammed [6, 17, 20].\n\n## Consequences and Aftermath\n\nThe Portuguese defeat at Alcácer Quibir had profound and far-reaching consequences [4, 18]. The death of King Sebastian, who had no direct heir, triggered a succession crisis in Portugal [2, 15, 18, 30]. Cardinal D. Henrique, Sebastian's great-uncle, became regent in 1562 and king in 1578 until his death in 1580 [2].\n\nSeveral contenders emerged for the Portuguese throne, including Philip II of Spain, D. Catarina (Duchess of Bragança), Manuel Felisberto (Duke of Savoy), Catherine de Medici, and António, Prior of Crato [2]. Dom Antônio, Prior of Crato, was the illegitimate son of Infante D. Luís and Violante Gomes [15, 25]. Despite his illegitimacy, Dom Antônio actively pursued the throne, facing opposition from Cardinal D. Henrique and King Philip II of Spain [15]. Dom Antônio declared himself King Antônio I of Portugal in Santarém on June 19, 1580 [15, 25].\n\nThe Battle of Alcântara occurred on August 25, 1580, resulting in Dom Antônio's defeat [15, 25]. The Portuguese defeat led to the Spanish annexation of Portugal in 1580, marking the beginning of the Iberian Union (1580-1640) [4, 1, 2, 17, 18]. The forced integration of Portugal and its overseas empire into the Spanish crown had global consequences [18].\n\nThe Saadi victory solidified their dominance in North Africa [4]. The battle marked the end of medieval warfare in Portugal [4].\n\n## The Myth of Sebastianism\n\nThe death of King Sebastian and the uncertainty surrounding his fate gave rise to the myth of Sebastianism [2, 6, 10, 15, 17, 19, 20, 27, 33, 34]. This myth held that King Sebastian did not die at Alcácer Quibir but would return to reclaim his throne and establish a millennial kingdom of justice [12, 17, 27]. D. João de Castro (1550-1628) is identified as a key figure in establishing the myth of King Sebastião's return [10]. D. João de Castro used a collection of old and new prophecies to support the belief in King Sebastião's return [10]. This action served to discredit D. António's aspirations to the throne of Portugal [10].\n\nThe prophecies of Gonçalo Anes Bandarra, written before Sebastian's birth, significantly contributed to the Sebastianist myth [20]. The myth of Dom Sebastião claims he transformed into a bull and awaits a return to establish a millennial kingdom of justice [12]. The myth is prevalent in the Lençóis region of Maranhão, Brazil [12].\n\nThe Sebastianist myth has been a recurring theme in Portuguese culture and literature, influencing authors like Almeida Garrett, Fernando Pessoa, and António Lobo Antunes [9, 14, 17, 20, 33, 34]. The myth has been reinterpreted and deconstructed in various artistic works, reflecting Portugal's changing national identity and its relationship with its imperial past [6, 14, 17, 19, 27].\n\n## Historiography and Cultural Representations\n\nThe Battle of Alcácer Quibir has been the subject of numerous historical accounts and cultural representations [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41]. Contemporary accounts of the battle include the anonymous \"Jornada de África del Rey D. Sebastião,\" which aimed to legitimize Philip II's claim to the Portuguese throne [1, 2, 3, 6]. This account presents negative interpretations of King Sebastian and António, Prior of Crato, portraying Philip II favorably [1, 2].\n\nSpanish Golden Age comedies, such as Lope de Vega's *La Tragedia del Rey Don Sebastián y del Príncipe de Marruecos* and Luis Vélez de Guevara's *Comedia Famosa del Rey Don Sebastián*, also depict the battle, serving as ideological instruments promoting the Habsburg dynasty's interests [7, 8].\n\nModern films, such as Manoel de Oliveira's *Non, ou a vã glória de mandar* and *Um Filme Falado*, explore the battle and the myth of Sebastianism, offering critical perspectives on Portuguese history and identity [6, 13, 19, 32]. Manuel Alegre's novel *Jornada de África* also uses the battle as a significant historical reference point to understand imperialism and colonialism [9, 13, 27].\n\nThe battle continues to be a subject of scholarly research, with projects like \"Sebástica manuscrita\" aiming to create digital catalogs and critical editions of unpublished manuscripts related to King Sebastian I's reign [3, 26].\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Battle of Alcácer Quibir was a watershed moment in Portuguese and Moroccan history [4, 18]. The battle resulted in a decisive Portuguese defeat, the death of King Sebastian, and the subsequent annexation of Portugal by Spain [4, 18]. The battle also gave rise to the myth of Sebastianism, which has profoundly shaped Portuguese national identity and cultural imagination [2, 6, 10, 15, 17, 19, 20, 27, 33, 34]. The battle continues to be a subject of historical and artistic interest, reflecting its enduring significance in the collective memory of both Portugal and Morocco [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41].",
