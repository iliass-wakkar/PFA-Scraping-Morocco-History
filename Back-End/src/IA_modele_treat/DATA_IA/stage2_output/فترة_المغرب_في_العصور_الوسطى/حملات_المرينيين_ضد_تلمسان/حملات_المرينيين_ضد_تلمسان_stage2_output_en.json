They were a Berber dynasty who rose to power after attacking an Almohad convoy around 1145 [7]. By 1269, Abu Yusuf invested Marrakech and was proclaimed sultan, marking the beginning of their rule in the Maghrib until 1465 [7]. The Marinids' rise coincided with the decline of the Almohad empire, which led to the emergence of three states: Ifriqiya, the extreme Maghreb (Marinids), and the central Maghreb, controlled by the Abd al-Wadid dynasty [4]. The Abd al-Wadids, a Zenata tribe, established an independent dynasty in the central Maghreb, with Tlemcen as their capital [4]. The Banu Abd al-Wad were part of the Zanata Berber tribe and shared nomadic origins with the Marinids [18]. The Marinids, initially nomadic, expanded their power by incorporating Zanata from central Maghreb and Arab troops into their armies, supplementing them with mercenaries [12]. The Marinids' expansionist ambitions brought them into direct conflict with the Abd al-Wadids of Tlemcen [7, 18]. The Abd al-Wadid dynasty's history involved a double relationship: with the Almohad caliphate in the 13th century and the Marinids from the 14th century onward [10].\n\n## The First Siege (1299-1307) and the Founding of Mansourah\n\nA major conflict between the Marinids of Fez and Tlemcen began around 1295, initiating a period of Marinid aggression [18]. Under Abu Said Othman ben Ya`qub, the Marinids besieged Tlemcen for eight years, from 1299 to 1307 [3, 5]. During this prolonged siege, the Marinid Sultan Abu Yacoub Youcef built the town of Mansourah near Tlemcen as a military camp to replace Tlemcen [3, 5]. The mosque of Mansourah was built around 1303 by Sultan Abu Yacoub [3]. The siege impacted the city and its population, causing hardship [5]. The poet Ibn Khamīs al-Tilimsānī fled Tlemcen in 1305 during the siege [2]. He composed nostalgic poems called Tilimsāniyyāt while in exile [2]. The siege was lifted in 1307 due to the assassination of the Marinid sultan [18].\n\n## Renewed Conflict and the Second Siege (1335-1337)\n\nThe Marinids returned under Sultan Abou al Hacen in 1335 and besieged Tlemcen, rebuilding Mansourah [3]. This second major siege lasted from 1335 to 1337 [5]. In 1337, after a two-year siege by Marinid sultan Abu-l-Hasan, Tlemcen fell under Marinid control for about ten years [18]. Tlemcen was occupied by the Marinids from 1337 to 1348 [8, 12]. The Marinid rule installed in Tlemcen from 1337 favored the settlement of Hilalian Arabs north of Chlef, in contact with Ouarsenis [9].\n\n## Marinid Rule and Subsequent Events\n\nDuring their rule, the Marinids enhanced the veneration of Sidi Bu Medien in Tlemcen, embellishing his mausoleum and adding the Al-'Ubbad mosque and a madrasa [12]. The Mosque of Sidi Boumediene within the Tlemcen National Park was built in 1328 by Abu al-Hassan, a Marinid Sultan of Fes [14]. Tlemcen's economy prospered under Marinid rule, benefiting from extensive trade, including Saharan trade [12].\n\nTlemcen was liberated in 1348 due to the Marinids' defeat in Tunisia [18]. However, it fell to the Marinids again in 1352 under Abu Inan [18]. During the second Marinid occupation (1352-1359), Abu Inan constructed the Sidi al-Halwi mosque, a madrasa, and a zawiya [12]. Tlemcen returned to Abd al-Wadid control in 1359 after a revolt, marked by Hammū II's accession [18].\n\n## Decline and Later Conflicts\n\nThe Abd al-Wadid dynasty's weakened state led the Marinids to favor supporting Abd al-Wadid claimants over outright conquest [18]. After 1389, the Abd al-Wadids lost military capabilities, becoming susceptible to Hafsid influence from Tunis by 1424 and beyond [18].\n\nIn the early 16th century, Aroudj Barbarossa conquered the kingdom of Tlemcen [11]. The Spanish supported Bou-Hammou against the Barbarossas [11]. Tlemcen was under siege, and Aroudj Barbarossa died during or after the siege [11]. In the late period of the Abd al-Wadids, Tlemcen fell under Spanish (1509) and Turkish (1517) control multiple times before ultimately falling to Sa'adi and then Turkish forces in 1550 [18].\n\n## Legacy\n\nThe constant conflict between the Marinids and Zayyanids is reflected in the construction of the Ya'qubiyya complex in Tlemcen in 1362–1363 by the Zayyanid sultan Abu Hammu Musa II [1]. The complex was built to commemorate Zayyanid family members who fought against the Marinids [1]. The ruins of Mansourah remain as a testament to the Marinid presence in the region [3, 14].",
