  "article_text_raw": "# The Wattasid Seizure of Power from the Marinids\n\n## The Marinid Dynasty: A Period of Rise and Decline\n\nThe Marinid Kingdom, a Berber dynasty, existed from 1215 to 1465 [1]. Their involvement in politics began in 1195 when they aided the Almohads in the Battle of Alarcos [1]. They captured Marrakech in 1269 [1]. The Marinid rule is generally divided into three distinct eras: a period of establishment and consolidation (1215-1269), a golden era characterized by prosperity and strength (1269-1335), and a final era marked by decline and eventual downfall (1358-1465) [1]. This final period witnessed the gradual erosion of Marinid authority and the ascendance of the Wattasids [1].\n\n## Internal Factors Leading to Marinid Decline\n\nSeveral internal factors contributed to the weakening of the Marinid Kingdom and paved the way for the Wattasid takeover [1]. These included constant fighting for the throne, particularly after the death of Sultan Abu Inan Faris, which created instability and weakened the central authority [1]. Weak leadership in the wake of Abu Inan Faris's death further exacerbated the situation [1]. The excessive power wielded by the viziers, especially during the era of Wizarat Tafwid (delegated power to the viziers), significantly undermined the Sultan's authority and allowed the viziers to usurp power [1]. A dwindling spirit of jihad also contributed to the decline [1].\n\n## The Role of the Wattasids and the Fall of the Marinids\n\nThe Wattasids held a significant position within the Marinid administration, ultimately enabling them to seize power [1]. The appointment of Jews to key administrative positions, particularly the appointment of Harun ibn Batash as a vizier by Sultan Abd al-Haqq II (1420-1465), proved to be a controversial decision [1]. This decision sparked a reformation movement led by the Wattasids, culminating in the toppling of Sultan Abd al-Haqq II and the end of Marinid rule in 1465 [1]. The Marinid Kingdom was ultimately toppled by the Wattasids, who had previously served the kingdom as viziers [1].\n\n## The Wattasid Era and the Wider Maghreb Context\n\nThe Wattasids replaced the Marinids in 1465 [1]. The period following the Wattasid takeover, from 1465 to 1580, is described as a \"Hundred Years War for Morocco\" [2]. This era, encompassing the early modern Maghrib, was characterized by warfare and state building [2]. The Wattassids ruled in Maghreb al-Aksa [3]. However, the Wattassids, along with the 'Abd al-Wadids and the Hafsids, experienced a decline in their authority [3]. The Wattassides and 'Abd al-Wadids disappeared from the political scene in 1554 [3]. The conference series focuses on European sources of the history of the Maghreb from 1492 to 1578 [3]. The fall of Constantinople in 1453 and the Reconquista of Granada (1482-1492) are mentioned as contextual events [3]. The source also discusses the impact of European powers and the rise of Ottoman influence in the Maghreb [3]. The Hafsids declined approximately twenty years later [3].",
