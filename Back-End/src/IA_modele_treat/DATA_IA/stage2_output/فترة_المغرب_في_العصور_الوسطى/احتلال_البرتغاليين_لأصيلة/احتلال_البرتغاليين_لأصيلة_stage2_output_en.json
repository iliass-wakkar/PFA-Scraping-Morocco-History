  "article_text_raw": "# The Portuguese Occupation of Asilah\n\n## Background and Motivations\n\nThe Portuguese presence in North Africa spanned from 1415 to 1769 [1]. Driven by military ambitions, the protection of trade routes, imperial expansion, and the ideals of the Reconquista and the Crusades, the Portuguese sought to establish a network of military and commercial bases along the Moroccan Atlantic coast [2]. This expansion, beginning with the capture of Ceuta in 1415, extended south and east, relying on advanced navigation skills and the introduction of flanking fire defenses [1]. The Portuguese expansion project dates back to the late 13th century with the Treaty of Soria in 1291 [8]. The victory over the Marinids in the battle of Salado in 1340 gave fresh impetus to the Portuguese expansionist intents [8]. The Portuguese King Afonso IV got the enactment of the Papal Bull Gaudemus et exultamus in May 30th 1341, acknowledging the Portuguese Crown the right to conquer the Kingdom of Fez [8]. The Aviz dynasty resumed the expansionist project, prioritizing the Atlantic strategy over expansion to Granada [8].\n\nThe Portuguese considered their North African territories as conquests and occupations of Arab and Muslim cities, not as colonies [4]. Their interests in North Africa were also driven by a desire to prevent Marrakesh from accessing its seaports [6]. The Portuguese King Dom Manuel I supported Crusades and aimed to dethrone Muslim power in North Africa [16]. The Portuguese expansion in North Africa involved isolated enclaves along the Strait of Gibraltar and Atlantic coasts [6].\n\n## Conquest and Initial Control (1471)\n\nAsilah (Arzila), along with Tangier, was conquered by the Portuguese in 1471 during the reign of King Afonso V [4, 6, 16, 28, 33, 40]. Dom Afonso V's forces attacked and penetrated Asilah on August 24, 1471, taking the city by surprise [40]. The conquest of Ceuta in 1415 marked the starting point of the implementation of this strategy and the benefit to the maritime cities involved in maritime trade with northern Europe [8]. Ceuta was considered the key to the Strait, impacting commercial circulation to and from the Mediterranean and the safety of coastal communities [8]. The capture of Asilah caused fear among the residents of Tangier, located 38 kilometers away, who abandoned the city, opening its doors to the Portuguese [32]. By the end of 1471, the Portuguese controlled the main cities on the African shore of the Strait of Gibraltar [32]. The capture of Asilah and Tanger marked the start of Portuguese rule in northern Morocco [32].\n\nFollowing the conquest, the Wattasid sultan recognized Portuguese control over Asilah with a 20-year protection agreement [2, 21]. A thirty-year truce existed between the King of Portugal and the Sultan of Fez [15]. The Portuguese secured a 20-year truce with the King of Fes, renewable for another ten years, after taking Asilah and Tanger in 1471 [40]. The Portuguese enslaved 250 Jews from Asilah after the conquest [13, 42]. Isaac Abravanel organized a committee and raised funds to rescue 220 of these Jewish prisoners [13]. Muley Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn Yahya (1464-1526), the future Wattasida sultan of Fez, was captured as a seven-year-old child by the Portuguese in the conquest of Asilah in August 1471 and remained in Portugal as a hostage to the king for two years [13].\n\n## Urban Transformation and Fortification\n\nFollowing the conquest, the Portuguese implemented urban planning and architectural strategies to reshape and fortify Asilah [40]. This included the 'atalho' method (downsizing), which involved reducing the city's size to make it more defensible [6, 15, 40]. The Portuguese occupational praxis involved downsizing the urban space by building new curtain walls (atalho) [5]. The Portuguese aimed to erase the previously built Islamic footprint in the cities [5]. The alterations aimed to align urban space with European culture [5]. Military architecture and urban morphology were adapted to reflect European concepts [5].\n\nIn 1508, an Arab siege and assault on Asilah led the Portuguese to reduce the town to 45% of its original size using a serrated atalho [4]. The Portuguese redesigned Asilah, keeping only the sea-facing half and creating two juxtaposed rectangles, with the castle in the smaller rectangle and the town in the bigger one [4]. The Portuguese in Asilah constructed a fortified belt adapted to recent military techniques for gunpowder combat [4]. King Manuel I reduced Asilah's urban area for military sustainability, a technique called 'atalho' applied to other Portuguese conquests in the Maghreb [15]. The 'atalho' reduced the city to approximately 43% of its pre-Portuguese size [15].\n\nIn 1509, Master builder Diogo Boytac was called to Asilah to build a new donjon and establish a work plan for further construction [4]. In 1510, Diogo Boytac was sent to Asilah to build new walls and the Menagem tower [2, 25]. Francisco Danzilho continued Boytac's work between 1511 and 1514 [4, 6, 15]. The 1514 Livro das Medidas das fortalezas de Arzila, Alcácer, Ceuta e Tânger documents the works carried out at the northern strongholds [6]. The Portuguese constructed a fortified belt adapted to recent military techniques for gunpowder combat [4]. A housing program was implemented in Asilah to replace houses destroyed in the 1508 assault [4]. References to 'old town' versus 'new town' suggest a new town grid scheme was established in Asilah by the Portuguese [4]. The Portuguese urban fabric in Asilah included geometrically rectangular blocks divided by perpendicular and parallel streets to the main square [4]. The Rua Direita, the traditional spine of Portuguese medieval cities, was present in Asilah, corresponding to either Tijara, Sidi Ali Ben Handouch, or Bab R’Mel streets [4]. The Portuguese focused on street pavement and water supply in Asilah, including a public fountain [4]. Structures known as couraças were built in Asilah, Tangier, and Ksar es-Seghir as early as 1502 to provide garrisons with easy access to water [8].\n\nThe Portuguese also adapted existing buildings, such as mosques, into churches [40]. The orientation of mosques towards the east or east-southeast facilitated their conversion into Christian churches, with the mihrab readily housing altars [40].\n\n## Loss and Recapture\n\nThe Saadian army took Asilah temporarily from 1550 to 1577 [2]. In 1541, the loss of Santa Cruz to the Berber conquerors led to the abandonment of several cities including Asilah, Azemmour and Safi [6]. The Portuguese evacuated Asilah in 1550, returning the city to the Arabs [15]. The Portuguese lost Asilah definitively in 1589 after the Battle of Three Kings [2]. Asilah returned to Iberian control between 1577 and 1589 [21].\n\n## Legacy and Heritage\n\nLess than eight decades of Portuguese presence in Asilah were enough to establish instruments of regular urbanism that still mark the city's present dimension and street display [4]. The central core of the early-XVIth century Portuguese urban action in Asilah was later covered by a less regular fabric due to Islamic reoccupation [4]. Cul-de-sacs (derb), a distinctive mark of Islamic urbanism, invaded the original blocks in Asilah [4].\n\nThe Portuguese presence in Asilah is considered a 'past of the past', disconnected from contemporary identity and post-colonial issues [1]. The French protectorate placed Portuguese heritage under safeguard in 1912 [2]. Asilah was ruled by Spain from 1912 to 1956 [2]. The cultural association Al Muhit was founded in Asilah in 1972, starting the Festival International d'Asilah in 1978 [2]. The Menagem tower in Asilah was restored with the help of the Fundação C. Goulbenkian [2, 25]. The Portuguese fortifications and the Al Kamra Tower were restored as part of the festival's efforts to upgrade the city's infrastructure [22]. The tower of the Portuguese castle in Asilah was in a dilapidated state when architect Viana de Lima began its restoration in 1987 [27]. The restoration efforts by the architect and historians failed to restore the tower to an acceptable state and resulted in an overly aggressive intervention, leading to inappropriate restorations and the addition of non-existent elements to the old fortress tower [27].\n\nThe Portuguese presence in Asilah has also left a lasting impact on the city's vulnerability to natural disasters. Asilah was heavily impacted during the 1755 tsunami, with waves surging the fortifications and penetrating inland [26, 41]. Numerical modeling suggests that the built environment of Asilah is highly vulnerable to tsunami impact [26].",
