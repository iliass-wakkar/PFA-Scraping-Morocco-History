  "article_text_raw": "# The Portuguese Occupation of Tangier (1471-1662)\n\n## Background and Strategic Importance\n\nTangier, located on the northwest coast of Morocco on a bay of the Strait of Gibraltar, seventeen miles from the southern coast of Spain and 140 miles northeast of Rabat, held significant strategic importance [2]. Its location made it a key point for intercontinental trade, diplomacy, and military control [16]. The city had experienced multiple occupations throughout its history, including by Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Romans, Vandals, Byzantines, and Arabs [16].\n\n## The Portuguese Conquest and Rule (1471-1662)\n\nThe Portuguese presence in Morocco began with the taking of Ceuta in 1415 [29, 37]. Portugal's early African expansion was driven by economic motivations, strategic interests, and religious zealotry [34]. Attacks against Tangier occurred between 1433 and 1464 [27]. In 1437, Duarte I launched an attack against Tangier, but the expedition was a disaster [34]. The city of Ceuta was invaded by Portuguese troops in 1415 [28].\n\nTangier surrendered to Portuguese forces in 1471 under the rule of Alfonso V [27, 32, 34]. The \"Entrada en Tánger\" (Entry into Tangier) occurred on August 28 and 29, 1471, and depicted the peaceful occupation due to the city's abandonment [30]. The Portuguese occupation extended for more than two centuries and was marked by important events [27]. The King of Portugal captured Arcila, Tangier, and Alcázarquivir, fortifying them and imposing a yearly tribute on nearby populations [36]. The Portuguese King employed skilled German bombardiers in Alcázarquivir [36].\n\nThe Portuguese presence in the area led to the construction of numerous fortifications: walls, towers, bastions, fortresses [27]. The Portuguese rebuilt the walls of Arcila and fortified them with towers and a watchtower [32]. The Castelo in Tangier had round medieval cubelos at each angle except the south, which had a square keep (torre de menagem) [4]. The square keep resembled the one in Arzila, with three stories, a battlemented platform, and corner bartizans [4]. Around 1514, the platform on the north-east wing of the main corps de logis was likely transformed into a fully roofed top floor [4]. Renaissance chimneys present in the Civitates view were gone by the mid-seventeenth century [4]. A fountain or well was possibly located in the middle of the Castelo yard [4]. A Portuguese hornwork with two half-bastions was erected to reinforce the Castelo novo's east curtain, likely in the 1560s during a modernization phase [4].\n\nThe Portuguese adapted the fortification model to pyroballistics during their presence in the area [27]. The Portuguese presence in Safi impacted the Borj El-Bahar (sea castle), a historical monument dating back to the 16th century [25]. The Borj El-Bahar is in a poor condition due to marine erosion, possibly accelerated by the expansion of the Safi port [25].\n\nThe death of King Don Sebastián in the Battle of the Three Kings resulted in Portugal passing to Hispanic sovereignty under Felipe II until 1644 [27]. Ceuta was annexed by Spain in 1580 after the Portuguese defeat in the Battle of the Three Kings [28]. Despite regaining its independence around 1640, Portugal failed to recover Ceuta [28].\n\n## The Transfer to English Control (1662)\n\nIn January 1662, King Charles II acquired Tangier from Portugal as part of the dowry for his marriage to Catherine of Braganza [11, 23, 27]. Tangier was ceded by Portugal to England in 1661 [26]. The Anglo-Portuguese Alliance is often dated from the Treaty of Windsor of May 9, 1386, or the treaty of June 16, 1373 [15]. The alliance was in abeyance from 1580 to 1640 [15].\n\nDutch and Spanish-backed forces of al-Ghailan aimed to seize Tangier during the hiatus of the Portuguese to English transfer of ownership [7]. Lord Sandwich's squadron was present in Tangier Bay since October 10, 1661, but lacked the leverage to expedite the handover from Governor Don Luis de Almeida [7]. The defeat of a Portuguese raiding party on January 12 left the town of Tangier virtually undefended [7]. Almeida appealed to Sandwich for assistance after the January 12th Portuguese raiding party defeat [7]. Sandwich sent ashore 80 seamen under Vice Admiral Sir Richard Stayner to secure Tangier [7]. Sir Richard Stayner first occupied York Castle and seized other key installations in Tangier [7]. Tangier was secured by Stayner's actions a fortnight before Lord Peterborough's arrival on January 29 [7]. Stayner left Tangier late in June 1662 and died in Lisbon in early October [7].\n\n## Aftermath and Legacy\n\nAfter the Portuguese handover, Tangier became an English outpost from 1661-1684 [21]. Englishmen initially hoped Tangier would become a prosperous trading center and a base against Muslim corsairs [11]. The English crown established Tangier as a free port and crown colony [1]. A proclamation was issued on November 16, 1662, declaring Tangier as a free port [1]. The free port of Tangier was intended to be an international free-trade environment for all merchants, modeled after Livorno and Genoa [6]. However, Tangier was not successful as a Mediterranean free port [6]. The English occupation of Tangier was marked by mismanagement, domestic political tensions, and Moroccan resistance [11]. The English abandoned and demolished Tangier in February 1684 [11]. Tangier had to resist the Moors in the 17th century while Morocco was vigorous [20].\n\nThe Great Mosque of Tangier was converted to a church during the Portuguese occupation (1471-1661) and was restored to its function after the Portuguese occupation [33]. The Portuguese presence in Morocco also left a linguistic impact, with Portuguese loanwords entering Moroccan Arabic dialects [37].",
