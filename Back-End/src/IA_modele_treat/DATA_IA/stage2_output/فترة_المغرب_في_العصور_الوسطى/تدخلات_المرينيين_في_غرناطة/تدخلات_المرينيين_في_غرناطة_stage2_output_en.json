  "article_text_raw": "# The Marinid Interventions in Granada\n\n## Background and Context\n\nThe Nasrid Kingdom of Granada, the last Muslim stronghold in Andalusia, maintained diplomatic relationships with various contemporary powers [1]. Its history was intertwined with the Amazigh populations of North Africa [2]. During the Nasrid emirate, Granada had a Zanata army corps [2]. The Marinids, a Berber dynasty originating from Morocco, migrated and occupied part of the Nasrid territory during the Nasrid emirate [2]. The Marinids, along with the Hafsids and Zayanids, were among the weaker powers in the Maghreb during the early 16th century, facing internal conflicts and external threats from Spain and Portugal [4].\n\n## Military Interventions and the \"Strait Issue\"\n\nThe Benimerines (Marinids) intervened in the Iberian Peninsula in support of the Nasrid kingdom of Granada during the 13th century [5]. This intervention was a key factor in the 'Problema del Estrecho' (Strait Issue), a situation arising from the increasing power of the Christian kingdoms, the dominance of Christian fleets in the Mediterranean, and the intervention of North African Islamic empires [5]. The 'Batalla del Estrecho' (Battle of the Strait) reached its peak in the first half of the 14th century [5]. The Benimerin Sultan Abu-l-Hassán prepared an expedition to conquer the Iberian Peninsula [5]. However, Christian states, particularly Castile and Portugal, supported by the fleets of Aragon and Genoa, defeated the Muslims, including the Benimerines, in the Battle of Salado in the first half of the 14th century [5]. This victory ended the 'Problema del Estrecho' and established Christian hegemony in the Iberian Peninsula [5].\n\n## The Siege of Algeciras and Potential Alliances\n\nChaucer's Knight is said to have fought in the siege of Algeciras (1342-44) and possibly again in a later siege [3]. Some argue that the Knight may have fought for Sultan Muḥammad V of Granada [3]. The siege of Algeciras in question happened in late July 1369, directed by Sultan Muḥammad V [3]. The Knight's military career included service in the Levant, eastern Baltic, and kingdoms around the straits of Gibraltar [3]. The Knight fought in Algeciras and is linked to the emirate of Morocco (Belmarye, Banū Marīn) [3]. King Alfonso XI of Castile took Algeciras from Granada in 1344 [3]. In 1344, Alfonso's Iberian-Genoese coalition defeated an army sent by the Moroccan Sultan Abū’l-Ḥasan ‘Alī to relieve Algeciras [3]. Sultan Muḥammad V was an ally of King Pedro I of Castile and sent troops to help him fight Enrique de Trastámara [3]. After Pedro’s murder, Muḥammad V took territory along the border, including Algeciras [3]. Muḥammad V allied with the Marinids and Zayanids [3]. The Marinid emirate of Fez in Morocco and the Zayanid emirate of Tlemcen (in modern Algeria) were allies of Granada [3]. The Knight may have fought for Muḥammad V from late March 1369, through the siege of Algeciras in late July 1369, and into the 1370s [3]. The source suggests the Knight may have been involved in the campaigns to take Gibraltar and Ceuta for Granada in 1372 [3]. The Knight’s potential service with the Zayanids involved pushing the Marinids out of Tlemcen [3].\n\n## Diplomatic Relations and Ibn al-Khatib\n\nLisan al-Din Ibn al-Khatib, a vizier of the Nasrid sultans of Granada, had a close relationship with the Merinid sultans of Fes (Morocco) [8]. This relationship spanned approximately 25 years, from the beginning of Ibn al-Khatib's career in 1340 to his death in 1375 [8]. Ibn al-Khatib served multiple Nasrid sultans in Granada and dealt with at least ten different Merinid sultans [8]. Key Merinid sultans included Abū l-Ḥasan ʿAlī, Abū ʿInān Fāris, Abū Bakr al-Saʿīd, Abū Zayyān Muammad II, Abū l-Fāris ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz, Abū Zayyān Muammad III, and Abū l’ʿAbbās Amad [8]. Ibn al-Khatib's writings, such as the 'Rayānat al-kuttāb', are important sources for understanding the period [8]. He undertook diplomatic missions to Morocco and facilitated the passage of Merinid princes through Granada [8]. The political intrigues and rivalries within both the Merinid and Nasrid courts played a significant role [8]. Ibn al-Khatib's exile and death in Fez were linked to Granada and the Merinids [8].\n\n## Cultural and Political Aspects\n\nFour Marinid sultans dabbled in poetry: Abū l-Ḥasan ʿAlī (r. 731–749/1331–1348), Abū ʿInān Fāris (749–759/1348–1359), Abū l-ʿAbbās Aḥmad al-Mustanṣir bi-llāh (775–786/1373–1384), and Abū Fāris ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz al-Mustanṣir bi-llāh (796–799/1393–1396) [6]. Yūsuf iii (r. 810–820/1408–1417) of the Nasrid dynasty of Granada is considered a great poet-king [6]. The revolution of Fās in 869/1465 and the death of Sultan ‘Abd al-ḥaqq al-Marīnī marked a period of decline for the Marinids [7].",
