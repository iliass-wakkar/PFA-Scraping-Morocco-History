  "article_text_raw": "# The Portuguese Conquest of Ceuta: A Turning Point in Iberian and Moroccan History\n\n## Background and Strategic Importance of Ceuta\n\nCeuta (سبتة), a city located on the North African coast at the Strait of Gibraltar, held significant strategic and commercial importance in the medieval Mediterranean [3, 28, 29]. Its location made it a key point for trade between Morocco and the Iberian Peninsula, serving as Morocco's gateway to the outside world and a major transit point between Europe and Africa [29, 49]. The city was a central hub for Mediterranean trade and a crucial point of contact between Christian and Muslim powers [28, 29]. During the later Muslim period, Ceuta's strategic position and defenses were of great importance [3]. The city enjoyed a period of autonomy, highlighting its significance in the Strait of Gibraltar region, which was contested by Christian (Castile, Aragon, Genoa, Portugal) and Islamic (Moroccan, Nasrid) powers [29, 49].\n\n## Portuguese Motivations and Preparations\n\nBy the early 15th century, Portugal, under King John I of the House of Avis, sought to expand its territory and influence [12, 21, 29, 56]. The Portuguese aimed for economical and commercial benefits, Europe’s recognition, and religious Reconquest through their seizures and foundations in Northern Africa [20]. The conquest of Ceuta was seen as a way to demonstrate Portugal's legitimacy as a world power and to secure its position among other Christian monarchs [21, 38]. The notion of reconquest, with Portuguese kings claiming rightful inheritance to North African territories, also played a role [38]. The Portuguese preparations for the attack on Ceuta were shrouded in secrecy, causing concern among other Iberian powers and even within Portugal itself [24, 29]. To maintain secrecy, King Dom Joao devised a pretext for the military preparations by challenging the Duke of Holland, threatening war due to injuries and thefts suffered by Portuguese merchants in Holland [24]. Fernao Fogaca was sent to inform the Duke of Holland about King Dom Joao's plans and the necessity of a pretext to avoid alarming the Moors [24]. The King also assigned preparation and administrative tasks to his sons [24].\n\n## The Conquest of Ceuta (1415)\n\nOn August 21, 1415, Portugal conquered Ceuta, taking advantage of Morocco's internal divisions and instability during the late Marinid period [1, 28, 29, 49]. The Portuguese amphibious landing involved a large fleet of ships and a substantial army [1, 56, 86]. The fleet, consisting of 242 ships, sailed from Lisbon on June 23, 1415, carrying 50,000 soldiers and seamen [86]. The landing occurred at the Almina beach, exploiting a defensive lapse by the city's defenders [21]. The population of Ceuta resisted the Portuguese invasion but were ultimately overwhelmed [29]. Gomes Eanes de Zurara wrote a chronicle describing the walls and moats crossed during the Portuguese conquest of Ceuta [7].\n\n## Aftermath and Initial Portuguese Rule\n\nFollowing the conquest, Ceuta was subjected to looting and violence, with many residents killed or displaced [21, 29]. Juan I decided to retain control of Ceuta, emphasizing its religious and strategic importance [21]. D. Pedro de Meneses was appointed as the first captain and governor of Ceuta [1, 86]. The Portuguese reduced Ceuta's perimeter by 14% to the former medina area in a procedure called 'atalho' [7]. A central square in Ceuta connected major spots: the castle (former kasbah), the cathedral (former main mosque), the church Our Lady of Africa and rua Direita (main street) [7]. The Portuguese reduced Ceuta's perimeter for better defense, leading to a significant alteration of the city's structure [7]. The Portuguese conquest of Ceuta provided an existing urban and commercial fabric [7]. Ceuta suffered constant attacks from Fez and was totally dependent on Portugal [7].\n\n## Challenges and Adaptations of the Portuguese Garrison\n\nThe Portuguese garrison, numbering around 3,000 men under D. Pedro de Meneses, faced challenges adapting to a different style of warfare centered on mobility and ambushes, unlike the heavy cavalry tactics they were accustomed to [1, 7]. Horses were essential for the Portuguese garrison in Ceuta for reconnaissance, raiding, and defense against the Marinid forces [1]. The garrison faced sieges between 1418 and 1419 by Marinid forces and a Granadan fleet, which were eventually broken by the arrival of a Portuguese relief force [1]. D. Pedro de Meneses established a reconnaissance network using watchtowers and sea patrols to monitor enemy movements [1]. The garrison relied on supply ships from Portugal to maintain the city and prioritize experienced warriors to minimize casualties [1]. The Portuguese utilized mounted units in skirmishes outside the city gates, feigning retreats to draw enemies into range of crossbow fire [1]. During sieges, mounted units harassed enemy siege lines and sabotaged attacks [1]. The local Moroccan armies generally had superior numbers of mounted units compared to the initial Portuguese garrison [1]. The Portuguese acquired horses through raids on North African villages and purchases from foreign markets [1]. The 'Casa de Ceuta' in Lisbon was created to supply the fortress, including horses and war materiel [1]. Portuguese raids on North African villages targeted cattle, including horses [1]. The Portuguese used almogavars (light footmen) for reconnaissance ahead of the main force during raids [1]. The Portuguese garrison, after withstanding initial challenges, expanded its area of influence through raids and skirmishes [1]. D. Duarte de Meneses, son of D. Pedro, adopted a more aggressive military policy, using tactics like feigned retreats [1]. D. Pedro de Meneses died in Ceuta during the disastrous expedition to Tangiers in 1437 [1]. Portuguese forces attempted to take the castle of Tetuan in 1435 but were repelled [1]. The garrison used naval assets to support land forces, transporting footmen to coastal targets while cavalry moved overland [1].\n\n## Fortification and Urban Development\n\nThe Portuguese reduced Ceuta's perimeter by 14% to the former medina area in a procedure called 'atalho' [7]. A central square in Ceuta connected major spots: the castle (former kasbah), the cathedral (former main mosque), the church Our Lady of Africa and rua Direita (main street) [7]. Ceuta's bastion fortifications were built between 1541 and 1549 [30]. In 1541, the plans for the fortress of Ceuta proposed the construction of a wide, deep ditch, also used as a maritime channel, ensuring separation between the town and the mainland [31]. The plans for Ceuta introduced the bastioned model and included an improved system of access from the exterior field and from the sea [31]. Bastions, curtains and repairs on the bastioned land front in Ceuta were carried out by integrating the ancient walls into the new construction [31]. A new system of access from the exterior field was established in Ceuta – a side entry protected against assault from land – leading to a reduction in the defensive perimeter and the demolition of an existing urban area [31].\n\n## Economic and Social Impact\n\nCeuta was an important Muslim commercial city during medieval times [6]. The Portuguese conquest of Ceuta in 1415 led to downsizing due to sustainability issues [6]. Ceuta's urban development was confined for over two centuries after the Portuguese conquest [6]. The Portuguese occupation of Ceuta turned it from a commercial center (slave market) into a strategic base for the conquest of Morocco [57]. Sentences of degredo could be cut in half with military service in North Africa [23].\n\n## Religious Transformation\n\nThe Portuguese appropriated and transformed religious buildings during their occupation [44]. The consecration of the Main Mosque symbolized a shift in faith paradigm due to the change of sovereignty [44]. New Christian temples and convents were built [44]. King João I built the Convento de São Tiago in Ceuta in 1416 [55]. In 1568, King Sebastião switched the Franciscan friars in Ceuta and Tangiers with Trinitarians for better rescue efforts [55]. The Trinitarian convent in Ceuta was established in 1569 [55].\n\n## Transition to Spanish Rule\n\nThe Spanish took over Ceuta in 1640 [6, 7, 14]. Portugal ceded Ceuta to Spain in 1640 [14]. In 1663, when the places in Africa were being given back to Portugal, Ceuta opted to remain with Spain [52]. On May 19, 1668, Ceuta was definitively incorporated into Spain by royal decree [52]. Article 2 of the 1668 Hispano-Lusitanian Treaty of Peace solemnly sanctioned Ceuta's voluntary incorporation to Spain [25].\n\n## Ceuta as a Spanish Enclave\n\nAfter the Spanish takeover in 1640, Muley Ismail imposed a long siege on Ceuta to recapture it [6, 7]. Spanish Ceuta began to expand towards Almina, the former suburbs over the peninsula [7]. The city of Ceuta has been recovering much of its medieval area and extended towards mainland, reoccupying the ancient Islamic domains [7]. Between 1694 and 1727, the long siege of Ceuta prompted significant expansions in external defenses [25]. The Treaty of 1860 established the final territorial limits of Ceuta, after the War of Africa [25]. Ceuta and Melilla are now heavily militarized borders between Europe and Africa [15].",
