  "article_text_raw": "# The Establishment of the Idrisid Dynasty\n\n## Background and Origins\n\nThe Idrisid dynasty, considered the first Shia dynasty to reach power in the Islamic world [2], was founded in Morocco in 172 AH (788 AD) by Idris ibn Abdullah [1, 10]. Idris ibn Abdullah, a descendant of Imam Hassan [1], fled Medina after the Battle of Fakhkh in 169 AH [1]. The Idrisids are believed by many researchers to have followed the Zaydi Shia branch [1]. The dynasty exerted control over the West African region for three centuries [2].\n\n## The Role of Idris I and Rashid\n\nIdris I arrived in Volubilis (Walili) in 778-779 after allying with the Berber Awraba tribe [42]. Rashid led Idris I to Volubilis from Mecca, passing through Egypt [22]. The Jewish tribes took on a political role in the subjugation of Morocco to Idriss I [15]. After conquering Tangier and Volubilis, Idriss I sought to persuade the Jewish tribes to join his army [15]. Idriss I attacked and plundered some Jewish cities like Temesna, Chellah, and Magada, prompting Jews of Tadla, Fazaz, and Shawiya to join his army under \"general\" Benjamin-monta Joshaphat-monto Abiezer [15]. After some successes, the Jewish contingent withdrew from Idriss I's army due to their aversion to bloodshed amongst their 'brothers' [15]. Idriss I retaliated against the Jewish community after their withdrawal [15]. The Jewish communities ultimately made peace with Idriss I, agreeing to pay a yearly capitation tax [15].\n\nWhile Idrīs I and Idrīs II are generally considered the founders of Muslim Morocco, Rāšid's role has been historically marginalized [22]. Rāšid succeeded Idrīs I and ruled for approximately twelve years [22]. Rāšid minted coins in his name in Volubilis and Tāhirt, the Rustamid capital [22]. The oldest anonymous coins found in Fès were minted during Rāšid's reign, suggesting he may have founded the city [22]. Some historians initially identified Rāšid b. Qādim as an Abbasid governor, but Moroccan archaeologists later suggested he was a local prince [34]. It is now argued that Rāšid b. Qādim was the regent for Idrīs II during his minority [34]. Fulūs of Rāšid b. Qādim found in Volubilis and Tahert are similar to those of Idrīs II (175/791-213/828) struck in Volubilis [34]. The fulūs of Rāšid b. Qādim are also analogous to those of the Rustumid ʿAbd al-Wahhāb b. Rustum (r. 167/784-199/824) struck at Tahert and Tlemcen [34]. The type of fulūs minted by the Idrisids and Rustumids is distinct from other coinage in the Maghreb at the time [34].\n\n## Consolidation and Expansion\n\nIn less than a year, Idris's authority extended from Tlemcen to the Rif of Tamasna, and from Tangier to the Oum Er-Rbia River [9]. The Abbasid Caliphate ceded authority over Morocco to the Idrisid dynasty in the 8th century [19]. The Idrisids integrated with tribes in the Fès region to initiate widespread Islamization [58].\n\n## The Founding of Fez and the Shift in Capital\n\nEstablishing a state requires a strong capital city as a base [2]. Initially, the Idrisids resided in the city of Walili (Volubilis) [2]. Idris ibn Abdallah founded Fes in the middle of the years 192 to 193 AH (Islamic calendar) [2]. Idris II chose Fes as the capital, shifting it from Walili [2]. The construction of Fez started on Thursday, Rabi’ al-Awwal 192 AH / 4 January 808 AD [5]. Idris II founded Fez and made it the capital of the Idrisid state [5]. Idris bin Abdullah built a city on the right bank of the Fez River in 172 AH / 789 AD [5]. The historical city of Fez was considered the capital of the Idrisid state from the middle of the third century AH / ninth century AD [5]. Favorable geographical and strategic factors allowed the Idrisid rulers to govern effectively from Fes [2]. Fes became a hub for scholars, traders, and a successful industrial zone under Idrisid rule [2]. The founding of the Medina of the Idrisids (VIII-IX centuries) led to the silting up of the travertine system [33].\n\nIdris II, after building his capital in Fez, launched a campaign in 197 AH/812 AD towards Nefis and the Masmuda tribes, successfully imposing control and incorporating Aghmat [9]. Following the death of Idris II, his son Muhammad divided the state among his brothers. Abd Allah received Aghmat, the land of Nefis, the Masmuda, and the Souss [9].\n\n## The Role of Women\n\nThe Idrisid State flourished due to attention given to women and their views being incorporated into governance [1]. Women in the Idrisid State played a vital role in intellectual life across culture, economy, scientific advancement, architectural art, and power structures [1]. Kenza, wife of Idris I, was a key figure who provided advice to rulers and held a prominent position among the Berbers [1]. Kenza was instrumental in maintaining the Zaydi ideology after the death of Idris I [1]. Kenza influenced Idris I's decisions and played a role in dividing the Idrisid territories among his sons and grandsons [1]. Fatima al-Fihri (Umm al-Banin) founded the al-Qarawiyyin mosque in Fez in 245 AH, which became a major center of learning [1]. The construction of al-Qarawiyyin was financed by Fatima al-Fihri and involved using materials from the land she purchased, reflecting her religious commitment [1]. Al-Qarawiyyin is considered the oldest university in the world still in operation [1]. Maryam al-Fihri, Fatima's sister, founded the al-Andalusiyyin mosque in Fez [1]. Atika bint Ali ibn Omar al-Idrisi played a key role in her father assuming power during a period of unrest [1].\n\n## Interactions with Other Powers\n\nIbrahim bin al-Aghlab founded the Aghlabid dynasty in Tunis in 184 A.H./800 A.D. [3]. Ibrahim bin al-Aghlab defeated insurgencies from the Idrisids and Kharijites in Ifriqiyyah [3]. The Idrisids \"never established very firm or wide-ranging political or Shia religious authority, but it did bring Islam to the ‘Far West’ of the Muslim world\" [23]. The Idrisid Dynasty (788-974) was seen as the hope for Shi‘ites fleeing Abbasids’ persecution [24]. In the 10th century (IVeH.), the Rif mountains provided a refuge for Idrisid princes who were under threat from the Fatimids of Tunis and the Umayyads of Cordoba [50]. The Zanata replaced the defeated Idrissids with the Kutama being defeated [55].\n\n## Decline and Legacy\n\nThe Idrisid dynasty existed from 788 to 921 [44]. The Idrisids were partially integrated into the Fatimid camp, while other branches resisted [41]. Musa b. Abi l-'Afiya, a Fatimid agent known for his hostility towards the Idrissids, later joined the Umayyads [41]. The rise of the Fatimids resulted in the disappearance of several political entities including the Idrissids [41]. No remains exist of the Idrisid Palace built in Agadir [12, 13]. The destruction of the Idrisid palace is seen as evidence of the diminution of sovereignty and the demise of their power and legitimacy [13].",
