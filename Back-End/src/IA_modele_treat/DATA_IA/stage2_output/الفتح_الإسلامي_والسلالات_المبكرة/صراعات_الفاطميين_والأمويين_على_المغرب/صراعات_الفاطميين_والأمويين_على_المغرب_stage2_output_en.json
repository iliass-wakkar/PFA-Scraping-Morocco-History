The Fatimids, a Shia Muslim dynasty, claimed descent from the Prophet Muhammad's daughter Fatima and sought to establish their rule in North Africa [2]. They aimed to extend their control throughout the region and even into Egypt, challenging the Abbasid caliphate [2]. The Umayyads, based in al-Andalus, also sought to exert their influence in North Africa [1]. Previous analyses often prioritized the geopolitical rivalry between the Umayyads and Fatimids as the primary driver of conflict [1].\n\n## Fatimid Expansion and Challenges\n\nThe Fatimids utilized the Kutama Berber tribe to conquer the Aghlabids [2]. A Fatimid missionary, Abu Abdallah, played a key role in this conquest [2]. The Fatimids established their capital in Mahdiya, located between Sousse and Sfax [2]. They extended their control throughout North Africa, controlling trade routes and commerce with sub-Saharan regions [2]. However, the Fatimids faced resistance from the Kharijites and other groups [2]. The Fatimids treated the Berbers with contempt, often referring to them as \"rabble\" or \"scum\" [2].\n\n## The Zirids and the Hilalian Tribes\n\nAl-Mu'izz, the last Fatimid ruler to spend significant time in Ifriqiya, transferred governance to the Zirid dynasty [2]. The Zirids were a Berber dynasty who initially served as Fatimid vassals [2]. However, the Zirids eventually broke away from Fatimid rule in 1048 [2]. In response, the Fatimids sent the Banu Hilal and Banu Sulaym Arab tribes to Ifriqiya in 1051-1052 [2]. These tribes, estimated at 50,000 warriors and 200,000 Bedouins, were given land grants (iqtâ') by the Fatimid caliph [2]. The arrival of the Hilalian tribes is often characterized as an invasion, with devastating consequences for the region [2]. Ibn Khaldun described the Hilal tribes as destructive nomads, contrasting their lifestyle with settled urban populations [2].\n\n## The Impact of the Hilalian Migrations\n\nThe Hilalians' advance led to a devastating conflict with the Zirides, culminating in the fall of Kairouan after a five-year siege (1051-1056) [2]. The Zirid dynasty fled to Mahdiya [2]. The Hilalian tribes expanded throughout the eastern Maghreb, taking control of the plains and coastal areas, while the Berbers retreated to the mountainous regions [2]. The fragmentation of Ifriqiya resulted in local authorities paying tribute to Hilalian chiefs [2]. The Hilalians' impact on the region was seen as both negative (political fragmentation, economic disruption) and positive (cultural exchange, demographic shift) [2]. Some historians argued that the Hilalian migrations were a consequence of the weakness of the urban centers in North Africa [2]. The Hilalian tribes' arrival marked a turning point in the history of the Maghreb, introducing new dialects and impacting the cultural landscape of the region [2]. The Hilalian tribes were eventually integrated into the Berber population, leading to a significant cultural and ethnic exchange [2]. The arrival of the Hilalians marked a notable shift from classic Arabic to regional, vernacular dialects infused with Berber influences [2]. Despite initial conflicts, some later Berbers and the Hilal tribes formed alliances and/or sought partnerships to maintain their respective power [2].\n\n## The Role of Gold Trade\n\nThe circulation of Sudanese gold in the 4th/10th century played a significant role in the political landscape of the Maghreb [1]. The gold was extracted and refined in the Niger Bend, transported across the Sahara to the Maghreb, and then potentially to al-Andalus, the Latin West, or the Middle East [1]. While the territorial disputes between the Umayyads and Fatimids are important, the gold trade from the Sudan to al-Andalus deserves more study [1]. Examining the gold trade offers a new perspective on the 4th/10th century Maghreb before the rise of Berber dynasties [1]. The author argues for a more comprehensive understanding that incorporates the gold trade's role [1].",
