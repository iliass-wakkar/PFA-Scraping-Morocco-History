  "article_text_raw": "# The Islamic Conquest of the Maghreb\n\n## Background and Initial Incursions\n\nThe Islamic conquest of the Maghreb (North Africa) began in the mid-1st century AH / 7th century AD and lasted nearly seventy years [3, 39, 40]. This expansion was not a random event but based on a well-structured military plan initiated by the Caliphs and governors [3]. The conquest began with initial reconnaissance campaigns [3]. Egypt served as a base to oversee the conquest of the Maghreb [3]. In 22 AH/643 AD, Amr ibn al-Aas seized Cyrenaica with little resistance from the Luwata and Hawwara Berbers [20, 87]. He also captured Tripoli after a rapid siege [20, 87]. In 27 AH/647 AD, Abd Allah ibn Sa'd launched an attack against Byzacena and defeated the exarch Gregorius near Suffetula (Sbeitla) [87].\n\n## Early Governors and Consolidation Efforts\n\nMuawiyah ibn Hudayj was appointed as the first governor of Africa, separating the Maghreb from Egypt [3]. Uqba ibn Nafi al-Fihri was appointed as governor of Africa by Caliph Muawiyah ibn Abi Sufyan around 50 AH/670 AD to continue the Islamic conquest [3]. Uqba followed the coastal route and captured Jarmath [19]. He also founded the city of Kairouan around 50 AH, which became a military center for Muslims [3, 29, 40]. Uqba built a military camp near a high point called al-Qarn in the region of Qamunya, which later became the city of Kairouan [29].\n\nHowever, Uqba ibn Nafi was removed in 55 AH/675 AD by Muawiyah ibn Sufyan and replaced by Abu al-Muhajir Dinar due to the efforts of Maslama ibn Mukhallad, the governor of Egypt [3]. Abu al-Muhajir Dinar treated Uqba poorly after his removal [3]. Yazid ibn Muawiyah reinstated Uqba ibn Nafi as governor of the Maghreb in 62 AH/681 AD after the death of Maslama ibn Mukhallad [3]. Abu al-Muhajir was removed, and Uqba imprisoned him [3].\n\n## Berber Resistance and Key Figures\n\nDespite initial successes, the Islamic forces faced significant Berber resistance [3, 63]. In 59 AH/678 AD, Kusayla, chief of the Awraba, converted to Islam [87]. However, in 63 AH/683 AD, Uqba ibn Nafi was killed by Kusayla near Tahudha [3, 29, 87]. Kusayla ruled a Berber kingdom from 68 AH/687 AD to 71 AH/690 AD [87]. Uqba ibn Nafi was killed in a battle at Tahudha in 63 AH by the Romans and their allies, including Kusaila [29]. In 71 AH/690 AD, Zuhayr ibn Qays defeated and killed Kusayla at Mamma [87]. Zuhair ibn Qays al-Balawi was killed by the Romans at the coast of Darna [29].\n\nAnother key figure in the Berber resistance was al-Kahina, chief of the Djarawa [65, 87]. Hassan ibn al-Nu'man was appointed governor and fought against al-Kahina [3, 87]. Hassan ibn al-Nu'man succeeded in occupying Carthage [29]. In 82 AH/701 AD, al-Kahina was killed in battle, and the Berbers of the Aures requested amnesty [65, 87]. Hassan bin al-Nu'man defeated and killed al-Kahina in 82 AH/701 AD [65].\n\n## Completion of the Conquest and Expansion into Iberia\n\nHassan ibn al-Nu'man was removed in 86 AH/705 AD by al-Walid, son of Abd al-Malik, and replaced with Musa ibn Nusair [3]. In 83 AH/702 AD, Hassan destroyed Carthage and founded Tunis [87]. Musa ibn Nusair continued the conquest of the Maghreb [3, 87]. Musa ibn Nusair's forces are claimed by some sources to have killed over 600,000 people near a town called Tahuda, where Uqba ibn Nafi and his men had been martyred [19].\n\nAbdullah ibn Musa ibn Nusair was removed in 98 AH due to exaggerating enslavement, mistreating the Berbers and conflict between Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik and Musa ibn Nusair [3].\n\nWith the Maghreb largely under Islamic control, the stage was set for expansion into the Iberian Peninsula [28, 29]. Tarif led a reconnaissance expedition into southern Iberia in 91 AH/710 AD [29, 87]. In 92 AH/711 AD, Tariq ibn Ziyad defeated the Visigoths, leading to the Muslim conquest of Spain [29, 87]. Abu Zar'a Tarif ibn Malik al-Ma'afiri led exploratory campaigns to the coast of Spain in 91 AH [29].\n\n## Impact and Aftermath\n\nThe Islamic conquest had a profound and lasting impact on the Maghreb [39, 40]. The conquest contributed to a new identity for the inhabitants of the Maghreb region and transformed the region into an Arab and Muslim land [39, 40]. The Arabic language and Islamic culture spread throughout the region, influencing various aspects of life [7, 22]. The creation of the Maghreb script is traced back to the Islamic invasion of the Maghreb [10].\n\nThe conquest also led to the destruction of pagan and early Christian monuments, according to some accounts [18, 19]. Some philosophers blame the Arabs for the social and economic ruin of Africa [18]. However, the conquest also brought about political, social, and economic stability, which contributed to the widespread use of gold [30].\n\nThe Berber population gradually converted to Islam, although resistance continued for some time [13, 42]. The Arab influence in the Maghreb was more cultural than demographic, due to the relatively small number of Arab invaders in the 7th century compared to the indigenous Berber population [13].\n\nThe Islamic conquest also led to the establishment of new cities and the development of existing ones [6, 16, 17, 39, 40]. Kairouan, founded by Uqba ibn Nafi, became a major center of Islamic learning and culture [3, 29, 40]. Other important cities included Tahert, Sijilmasa, and Fez [40].\n\nThe Maliki school of Islamic jurisprudence became dominant in the region [38, 42, 53]. Amazigh scholars played a significant role in spreading Islamic teachings and preserving the Arabic language [41, 42].\n\nThe conquest also had a significant impact on trade and economic activity [25, 30, 55]. Fezzan served as a link between Sudan and Jebel Nafusa, connecting to cities and ports of Ifriqiya [25]. Gold was imported from Sudan and used in various industries [30].\n\n## Controversies and Differing Perspectives\n\nThe Islamic conquest of the Maghreb has been subject to scholarly debate and controversy [1, 18, 19]. Some historians argue that the conquest was a destructive force, leading to the destruction of cultural heritage and the exploitation of the indigenous population [18, 19]. Others emphasize the positive aspects of the conquest, such as the spread of Islam, the development of cities, and the establishment of trade networks [39, 40].\n\nAccusations of violence, mistreatment of prisoners, and excessive violence have been leveled against the Islamic conquerors [19]. Some sources claim that Musa ibn Nusayr's forces killed over 600,000 people near Tahuda [19]. However, counter-arguments and alternative interpretations of historical events have also been offered [19].\n\n## Long-Term Consequences\n\nThe Islamic conquest of the Maghreb had far-reaching consequences that continue to shape the region today [22, 26, 37, 38]. The Arabization and Islamization of the Maghreb led to the development of a unique Arab-Amazigh culture [22]. The region became a center of Islamic learning and culture, with cities like Kairouan and Fez attracting scholars from across the Muslim world [39, 40].\n\nThe conquest also led to the emergence of new political entities and the rise of Berber dynasties, such as the Almoravids and Almohads, who played a significant role in the history of both the Maghreb and al-Andalus [14, 15, 16, 26]. The migrations to the Islamic Maghreb, including the Islamic conquest, the migration of Banu Hilal, and the migration of Andalusians, had a profound impact on the region [38].\n\nThe legacy of the Islamic conquest continues to be debated and reinterpreted in contemporary society [52, 60]. The relationship between Arab and Berber identities, the role of Islam in shaping national identity, and the challenges of integrating diverse cultural traditions remain important issues in the Maghreb today [52, 75].",
