  "article_text_raw": "# The Umayyad Conquest of the Maghreb\n\n## Background and Initial Expansion\n\nThe Umayyad conquest of the Maghreb (North Africa) in the 7th century marked a significant period of expansion for the Umayyad Caliphate [1, 17]. This expansion, which began with the capture of Tripoli in 642 [65], aimed to bring the region back under Umayyad rule [55]. The conquest of North Africa proved to be a more difficult undertaking than other regions, lasting over half a century [2, 65]. The Arab armies faced resistance and experienced both victories and defeats during this prolonged campaign [65].\n\nThe Umayyad Caliphate, established after the assassination of Hazrat Ali, was the first Islamic dynasty [17]. The dynasty's power shifted from the Arabian Peninsula to Syria during the reign of Muawiya [17]. Under Muawiya's successors, the Islamic empire expanded significantly, reaching as far as China and India in the east, and North Africa and Spain in the west [17].\n\n## Key Figures and Military Campaigns\n\nHassan ibn al-Nu'man al-Azdi was appointed by Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan to lead the conquest and organize the Maghreb [55]. Hassan's military operations included victories against the Romans and the capture of Carthage [55]. He also campaigned against al-Kahina in the Aures Mountains [55]. After an initial defeat, Hassan requested reinforcements and eventually defeated and killed al-Kahina, ending the resistance [55].\n\nAround 698 AD, Byzantine Carthage was destroyed by Hassan and replaced by Arab Kairouan as the Umayyad capital of Ifriqiya (Tunisia) [13]. This resulted in the loss of Tunisia's grain supply to Byzantium [13]. In 701, 702, or 703 AD, Umayyad commander Musa ibn Nusayr subdued the Berbers of Algeria at the battle of Tabarka, Tunisia [13]. During the decade of 701-710 AD, Musa ibn Nusayr conquered Tangier and Sous in Morocco and started building a navy to conquer the Balearics [13].\n\n## Berber Involvement and Resistance\n\nMany Berbers joined the Muslim armies during the Umayyad conquest of North Africa [2]. However, Berber resistance to Arab rule also emerged, influenced by Kharijite doctrines [71]. The Berber Revolt of 739 AD, triggered by Umayyad-Arab taxation and discrimination, led to the expulsion of Umayyad power from Morocco and Algeria by 743 AD [13].\n\nIn the early eighth century, after the Muslim conquest of Morocco, Walīla was the residence of the Berber Awraba tribe who had reportedly converted to Islam [9].\n\n## Administration and Islamization\n\nFollowing the defeat of al-Kahina, Hassan ibn al-Nu'man divided the Maghreb into administrative districts and appointed officials, often locals, to manage taxes and zakat [55]. He implemented a policy of tolerance towards all inhabitants and organized efforts to spread Islam and Arabize Berber tribes [55]. Hassan's equal treatment of Berber converts led to political stability and loyalty to the Umayyad state, making him a popular figure in the Maghreb [55].\n\nArabization and Islamization standardized weights and measures and unified transaction technology, facilitating trade [30]. The Umayyad administration in Damascus introduced a new unified currency in the 7th century with Arabic inscriptions [30].\n\n## The Conquest of Al-Andalus\n\nThe Umayyad conquest of North Africa paved the way for the invasion of the Iberian Peninsula [15]. In 711 AD, Tariq ibn Ziyad crossed the Straits of Gibraltar, initiating the Umayyad conquest of Hispania [13, 18]. The conquest began as a large booty raid [18]. The Umayyad fals were likely produced during the Umayyad conquest of the Iberian Peninsula [18].\n\nThe conquest was supported by local populations and resulted in the control of most of the Iberian Peninsula and Narbonne in Septimania [18]. The Latin Cronica Mozarabe de 754 highlights the collaboration of the Visigothic elite, contributing to the rapid Umayyad conquest [18].\n\n## Aftermath and Legacy\n\nBy 743 AD, the Berber Revolt had expelled Umayyad power from Morocco and Algeria, weakening it in al-Andalus [13]. In 756 AD, Abd ar-Rahman ibn Mu'awiya successfully established the Umayyad Emirate of Cordova in al-Andalus [13].\n\nThe Idrisid dynasty, founded by Idrīs I, emerged as a major rival to the Abbasid Caliphate in the Far Islamic West [8, 19, 20]. Idrīs I arrived in Morocco in 788–789 and was welcomed by the Awraba tribe at Walīla (Roman Volubilis) [20]. He undertook military expeditions and minted silver dirham at Tudgha and Walīla to pay his followers [20].\n\nBy the tenth and eleventh centuries, the Maghreb was integrated into Sunni mainstream Islam [1]. The influence of Maliki scholars grew, leading to the adoption of the Maliki legal school [1]. The region became part of a transregional commercial network, including the slave trade [1].\n\n## Economic and Cultural Impact\n\nThe Umayyad conquest and subsequent rule had a significant impact on the economy and culture of the Maghreb. Morocco, with no economic prosperity before the Islamic conquest, became a military power [30]. The Umayyad administration invested in and organized the economy through policies like urbanization and monetization [30].\n\nThe conquest also led to closer relations between Berbers and Arabs in social, administrative, linguistic, and lexical fields [11]. Berbers held administrative positions such as scribes, ascetics, oppressors, and provincial governors [11].\n\n## Challenges to Umayyad Control\n\nThe Umayyad dynasty faced several challenges, including tribal fanaticism among Arab tribes, social jealousy among non-Arabs (Mawali), and power struggles within the Umayyad family [7]. Strong opposition from Shiites and Khawarij, ethnic disputes between Arab tribes, and a luxurious lifestyle within the Umayyad family also contributed to the dynasty's downfall [7].\n\n## The Role of Climate\n\nRecent research suggests that drought may have played a role in the Visigothic Kingdom's crisis and the subsequent Islamic expansion in the Iberian Peninsula [48, 49]. The drought from 695-725 CE, the most severe of the last 5000 years, coincided with the Umayyad Caliphate's expansion [49].\n\n## The Legacy\n\nThe Umayyad conquest of the Maghreb was a transformative event that shaped the region's political, economic, and cultural landscape. While the Umayyad dynasty eventually declined, its legacy continued to influence the Maghreb for centuries to come. The conquest facilitated the spread of Islam, the adoption of Arabic as a lingua franca, and the integration of the Maghreb into a wider Mediterranean world [10, 24].",
