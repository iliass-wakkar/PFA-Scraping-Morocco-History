They were a branch of the Maghrawa of Zenata, considered a major Moroccan tribe [1]. The Khazrunids established their rule in Sijilmasa in 367 AH / 977 AD, governing in the name of the Spanish Umayyad Caliph Hisham II Al-Mu’ayyd [1].\n\n## Sijilmasa: A Strategic Center\n\nSijilmasa was a crucial hub for communication and commerce, connecting the Mediterranean, the Sahara, and the Orient [1]. It was a pivotal city in the gold trade [1]. The Khazrunids controlled Sijilmasa from 367 AH / 977 AD to 445 AH / 1053 AD, with interruptions due to temporary Fatimid and Zirid incursions [1].\n\n## Political Landscape and External Powers\n\nDuring this period, almost all of Morocco was under Fatimid rule, yet the Spanish Umayyads minted coins in Sijilmasa [1]. A revolt led by Ziri in Fas temporarily disrupted Khazrunid control around 388 AH / 999 AD [1]. According to Ibn Khaldun, Wanudin became an independent ruler in Sijilmasa after 390 AH / 999 AD [1].\n\n## The Fall of the Khazrunids\n\nThe Al-Moravids conquered Sefrou in 455 AH / 1063 AD, leading to the extermination of the Khazrunid family and their followers [1].\n\n## Challenges in Historical Reconstruction\n\nIbn Khaldun's accounts are the primary source for Moroccan history, but they contain contradictions regarding the Khazrunids' reigns and lack details for the period [1]. Numismatic evidence, specifically Khazrunid gold coins, provides valuable insights into the political dynamics of the time [1]. The study of these coins helps to understand the conflicts between the Khazrunids and the Umayyad caliphate of Spain, and the Fatimids [1].\n\n## Numismatic Evidence and Rulers\n\nThe Khazrunid dynasty had more than three rulers, as previously thought [1]. Two additional rulers, Muhammad son of Mas'ud and Mas'ud son of Muhammad, are included in the new analysis based on Ibn Al-Khatib [1]. This study corrects previous interpretations of Wanudin's reign and expansion, pointing out inaccuracies in existing numismatic studies [1]. The scarcity of dated Khazrunid coins, issues with clipped margins, and the misreading of inscriptions (e.g., \"Wazir\"/\"Wanudin\") have posed challenges to previous numismatic studies [1].\n\n## New Coin Classifications and Attributions\n\nNew types of Khazrunid gold coins have been identified, and detailed descriptions of their inscriptions, often referring to Hisham II and Sulayman Al-Musta'in, have been provided [1]. Previous errors in identifying the rulers who struck coins have been corrected, and new attributions have been suggested based on coin inscriptions [1]. Numismatic evidence (coins) is used to refine and correct historical accounts of the Khazrunid period [1].",
