  "article_text_raw": "# Berber Revolts in Morocco: A Historical Overview\n\n## Early Resistance to Arab Rule\n\nThe history of Morocco is marked by numerous Berber revolts, stemming from resistance to various forms of external rule and cultural assimilation. The Arab conquest of North Africa in the 7th and 8th centuries brought Islam to the region, but also sparked resistance from the Berber populations [9]. The Arab expansion westward along the southern Mediterranean shore, beginning twenty years after the Hijra, posed a threat to Europe and involved interactions and conflicts with the Berber populations [14]. The Berbers resisted the Arab conquest, which also brought different branches of Islam, including Shī‘ite and Khārijite influences [9].\n\nBerber tribes, including the Awraba and Jawara, were protagonists in the early 7th century [8]. After Hasan's victory over the Kahena in the Hodna basin, the Berbers supplied 12,000 horsemen to the Arab general [8]. Tariq ibn Ziyad, a Berber, led troops in 710 consisting of seventeen thousand Arabs and twelve thousand Berber horse [8]. However, Umayyad policies, including heavy taxation, resource exploitation, and social discrimination, fueled resentment among the Berbers [34].\n\n## Kharijite Influence and Berber Uprisings\n\nReligious and sectarian factors, particularly the spread of Kharijism, played a significant role in inciting Berber revolts [34]. Berbers accepted Ṣufrism and Ibāḍism due to their emphasis on equality among Muslims regardless of ethnic origin, and to maintain political autonomy and strengthen Berber cultural identity [19]. The Khārijite revolt in North Africa serves as a reference point for analyzing Arabic texts about the Berbers from different traditions [20]. The role of the Berbers is a variable in these texts, sometimes converging with the stigma of the Khārijites in the Sunni world [20].\n\nThe Berber Revolt in Tangiers and the Maghreb spread into al-Andalus and contributed to the instability within the Umayyad Caliphate [33]. The Berber Revolt lasted until 743 CE [33]. The revolt led by Mûnise was triggered by harsh Umayyad policies towards the Maghrib Berbers [15]. The Mûnise revolt resulted in the weakening of Muslim rule in northern Andalusia, allowing Christians to begin the Reconquista [15]. The Great Berber Revolt caused throne fights, civil wars, famine, land losses, and cessation of military activities in Andalusia, radically shaking Muslim domination [15].\n\n## Berber Dynasties and Resistance\n\nDespite periods of conflict, Berber populations significantly influenced the linguistic traditions and political organization of North Africa [19]. Berbers played a vital role in Ibāḍī theology and integrated Islam into their local culture, creating a distinct North African Ibāḍī identity [19]. The Rusṭamid Imamate of Tāhart (763–909) is seen as the heyday of the Ibāḍiyya in North Africa [3].\n\nThe Almoravid dynasty was originally a religious movement initiated in Ṣanhādja Saharan Godala by Yaḥya b. Ibrāhīm and ‘Abdallāh b. Yāsīn [9]. The Almoravid dynasty ruled in the 11th – 12th century AD in the west of the Maghrib and in al-Andalus [9]. In AD 1152 the Almoravids were defeated by the Almohads [9].\n\n## The Rif Rebellion\n\nIn the 20th century, the Rif Rebellion, led by ‘Abd el-Krim, marked a significant moment of resistance against Spanish and French colonial rule [73]. Starting in 1920, ‘Abd el-Krim led a rebellion against the Spanish in the Rif Mountains [73]. The defeat of Spanish forces at Anoual on June 22, 1921, strengthened ‘Abd el-Krim's position and fueled the Rif rebellion [73]. In 1923, ‘Abd el-Krim declared the Rif Republic and became its president [73]. In 1926, Franco-Spanish forces decisively defeated 'Abd el-Krim's troops, leading to his surrender on May 27, 1926 [73]. ‘Abd el-Krim was exiled to the Île de la Réunion [73].\n\n## Modern Berber Activism and the Arab Spring\n\nIn more recent times, Berber identity has been a central issue in Moroccan politics. The Berber community, specifically the Rifians, viewed their economic straits as a function of the Moroccan state’s deliberate neglect after the Rif rebellion of 1958-59 [18]. The Moroccan state has gone to considerable lengths in legitimizing Amazigh identity, culminating in the adoption in July 2011 of a new constitution which explicitly recognizes the Amazigh language as an official state language [18].\n\nThe Arab Spring uprisings, which started in late 2010 in North Africa, also saw the involvement of Amazigh activists [1]. Amazigh militants played a role in the Arab Spring demonstrations and supported popular contestation movements [1]. Amazigh activists used distinctive flags and banners during the Arab Spring uprisings, seeking to assert separate identity and challenge the narrative of a uniform Arab Spring [1]. Beyond socioeconomic difficulties, protests in several countries revealed 'cultural claims' from populations refusing assimilation to Arab culture [1]. The Amazigh cultural movement became increasingly influential and organized in the decade leading up to the Arab Spring [1]. The development of the internet helped the Amazigh movement become transnational, incorporating Amazigh minorities and the diaspora [1]. The Amazigh movement includes cultural and political associations with different goals, such as promoting Amazigh languages/traditions and advocating for constitutional rights [1].\n\nIn response to the Arab Spring, the Moroccan monarchy instituted controlled constitutional reforms [21]. The Berber Tamazight was granted recognition as an official language in Morocco [21]. The population approved the constitutional reforms in Morocco with official figures of 98.5 percent approval on a turnout of about 73 percent [21].",
