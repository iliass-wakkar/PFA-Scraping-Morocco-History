  "article_text_raw": "# France's Endorsement of Morocco's Autonomy Plan for Western Sahara: A Historical Overview\n\n## The Western Sahara Conflict: Historical Context\n\nThe dispute over Western Sahara dates back to 1975, when Spain relinquished its colonial control over the territory, previously known as Spanish Sahara [2, 4]. Morocco subsequently annexed the region, a move contested by the Polisario Front, which, backed by Algeria, claims the territory and established the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) in 1976 [1, 2]. The Polisario Front seeks self-determination for the Sahrawi people [8, 18]. The conflict is a key aspect of the rivalry between Algeria and Morocco [8]. Algeria supports the Polisario, hoping for a friendly state that provides an Atlantic outlet for exports [8]. Morocco views Western Sahara as a natural and historical extension of its territory, seeking revenue from its phosphate and fish reserves [8].\n\nThe United Nations brokered a ceasefire in 1991, but a referendum on self-determination for the Sahrawi people has not been implemented [1]. The UN established the MINURSO (United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara) to monitor the ceasefire and organize a referendum [4]. However, the referendum process was plagued by disputes over voter eligibility, with Morocco controlling voter registration and determining which Sahrawis could register [4]. Former U.S. Ambassador Frank Ruddy, who served as Deputy Chairman of MINURSO, criticized the UN's handling of the referendum process, accusing Morocco of controlling the process and preventing a fair vote [4].\n\n## Morocco's Autonomy Plan\n\nIn March 2006, Morocco launched an autonomy plan for Western Sahara, intending it to replace the Baker III Plan, which called for a referendum after five years of autonomy [2]. The Moroccan autonomy plan aimed to grant the Saharan territory new support in terms of subsidiarity, consultation, and territorial negotiation [6]. The plan proposed autonomous rule under Moroccan supervision [4]. Article 6 of Morocco's autonomy plan reserves powers in defense, external relations, and constitutional/religious prerogatives for the King of Morocco [4].\n\nTo promote the autonomy plan, Morocco dissolved the Advisory Council for Saharan Affairs and replaced it with the Royal Advisory Council for Saharan Affairs (CORCAS) [2]. The 141 members of CORCAS are appointed by the Head of State, not elected [2]. CORCAS is tasked with engaging in reflection on the autonomy plan within the framework of Moroccan sovereignty [2]. The Moroccan government seeks to convert tribal or separatist allegiances into a national bond through mechanisms addressing the immediate interests of the population [6]. The Moroccan authorities aim to prepare the Sahrawi populations and local structures to embrace internal autonomy as an alternative to separatism [6].\n\n## France's Position and Involvement\n\nWhile the provided sources do not explicitly state a formal declaration of French support for the Moroccan autonomy plan, they offer insights into the complex relationship between France, Morocco, and the Western Sahara issue. France is identified as a key international actor with significant interests in the Maghreb region [16, 17]. France and Spain are highlighted as being particularly invested in the Maghreb region and the Western Sahara conflict, but their engagement appears motivated by self-interest like migration and anti-terrorism efforts [16, 17].\n\nHistorically, France has had a long-standing involvement in the region, including military interventions in the West Saharan region between 1958 and 1978 [9]. Operations Ecouvillon and Lamantin are examples of French military interventions during this period [9]. France collaborated with Spanish forces in their colony of the Sahara against groups composed of Moroccans, Algerians, and Saharans claiming to be part of the Moroccan Liberation Army [9].\n\nFrance's interventionist logic, especially in the Sahel, involves leveraging the regional rivalry between Morocco and Algeria [8]. Some analysts viewed Algeria's actions in the Sahel as a means to facilitate American presence in a region traditionally influenced by France and coveted by China [8].\n\nIn 2001, Spain reportedly blocked a French initiative for the EU to support the new Baker Plan for Western Sahara [20]. The Baker Plan envisioned Western Sahara as part of Morocco with autonomy, departing from the UN's referendum goal [20].\n\n## International Reactions and the Current Situation\n\nThe United States has also played a role in the Western Sahara conflict. The Trump administration reaffirmed its support for the Moroccan autonomy plan for Western Sahara, describing it as a \"serious, credible and realistic\" means of addressing the aspirations of the Sahrawi people [10]. On 10 December 2020, then US President Donald Trump announced US recognition of Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara [13].\n\nOther countries, such as Germany, have also expressed support for Morocco's autonomy proposal for Western Sahara [16, 17]. In contrast, countries like Ireland and Sweden have maintained a position more in line with the self-determination of the Sahrawi people [16, 17]. The EU's approach to the Western Sahara conflict is described as \"non-involvement,\" \"minimalist,\" and of \"minimum common denominator\" [16, 17]. The EU prioritizes bilateral relations with Morocco over engaging with the Frente Polisario [16, 17].\n\nThe conflict in Western Sahara remains unresolved, with renewed hostilities in recent years [13]. The Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (RASD) withdrew from the UN-negotiated ceasefire with Morocco on 13 November 2020, citing disputes over the Guerguerat buffer zone [13]. The situation continues to be a source of regional instability and a challenge to international efforts to promote peace and security in the Maghreb region [15].",
