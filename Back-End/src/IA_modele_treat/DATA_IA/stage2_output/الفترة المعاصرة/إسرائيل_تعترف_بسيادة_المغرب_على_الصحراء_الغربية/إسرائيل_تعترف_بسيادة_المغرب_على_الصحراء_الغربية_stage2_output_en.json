  "article_text_raw": "# Israel Recognizes Moroccan Sovereignty Over Western Sahara: A Historical Overview\n\n## Background and Context\n\nThe recognition by Israel of Moroccan sovereignty over the Western Sahara in July 2023 represents a significant development in the complex geopolitical landscape of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region [5]. This event is deeply intertwined with the Abraham Accords, a series of normalization agreements brokered by the United States in 2020 between Israel and several Arab states, including the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan, and Morocco [17, 30, 33, 34]. The Abraham Accords aimed to foster peace, security, and prosperity in the Middle East [17]. However, they have also been criticized for potentially undermining the Arab Peace Initiative and sidelining the Palestinian issue [19].\n\nMorocco's relationship with Israel has a long and complex history, marked by periods of cooperation and estrangement [4, 9]. Despite the absence of official diplomatic relations between 2000 and 2020, unofficial ties persisted, particularly in areas such as tourism and security [4, 12]. Approximately one million Moroccan Jews reside in Israel [4, 21], and tens of thousands of Israelis visit Morocco annually [4]. Secret relationships between Israel and Morocco existed from the 1950s to the 1970s, focusing on economic aid and Jewish emigration [9]. King Hassan II engaged in discreet meetings with Israeli leaders, aiming to play a mediating role in Arab-Israeli relations [9]. Liaison offices were exchanged in 1994 but closed in 2000 during the Second Intifada [4, 15, 17].\n\n## The Abraham Accords and US Recognition\n\nA key element in the normalization of relations between Morocco and Israel was the United States' recognition of Moroccan sovereignty over the Western Sahara [2, 5, 6, 7, 10, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 25, 26, 27, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 38, 39, 49, 53, 57, 59, 61]. On December 10, 2020, President Donald Trump announced this recognition as part of a deal in which Morocco agreed to normalize relations with Israel [15, 16, 25, 35]. This decision reversed decades of US policy advocating for UN-led negotiations between Morocco and the Polisario Front, which seeks independence for the Western Sahara [25, 27]. The US also pledged to open a consulate in Dakhla, a city in the Western Sahara, to promote economic and business opportunities [2, 7, 15, 16, 35]. The US reaffirmed its support for Morocco's autonomy proposal as the only basis for a just and lasting solution to the Western Sahara dispute [7].\n\nThe US recognition was met with mixed reactions. Some, like Senator James Inhofe, criticized the decision, arguing that it traded away the rights of the Western Saharan people [15, 16, 22]. Former US Secretary of State James Baker III also criticized the decision as contrary to international law [15, 16]. The UN reaffirmed its commitment to dialogue based on relevant Security Council resolutions [15, 16]. The European Union stated that its position on Western Sahara remained aligned with UN Security Council resolutions [15, 16].\n\n## Israel's Recognition of Moroccan Sovereignty\n\nFollowing the US lead, Israel officially recognized Morocco's sovereignty over the Western Sahara in July 2023 [5, 21, 26, 33]. This recognition fulfilled the tri-partite agreement reached at the end of 2020 [5]. The timing coincided with increased bilateral military and security cooperation between the two countries [5, 26]. This included the appointment of Israel's first defense attaché to Rabat and increased military collaboration [26]. Morocco has purchased drones and air- and missile-defense systems from Israel [26, 34], and Israeli military units participated in the U.S.-led African Lion military exercises in Morocco [26].\n\n## Motivations and Implications\n\nSeveral factors motivated Morocco's decision to normalize relations with Israel and seek recognition of its sovereignty over the Western Sahara. The US recognition was a long-sought goal for Morocco [2, 39], and the Abraham Accords provided an opportunity to achieve this [15, 16, 25, 35]. Morocco also sought to strengthen its ties with the US and Israel, particularly in the areas of security and economic development [7, 17, 21, 35].\n\nThe normalization agreement has led to increased cooperation between Morocco and Israel in various sectors, including security, military, trade, tourism, and technology [5, 17, 21, 26, 35]. Direct flights between the two countries have resumed [17, 21, 35], and embassies have been opened [17, 21]. Trade between Israel and Morocco has increased [25, 35], and agreements have been signed to boost bilateral trade [21, 35].\n\nHowever, the normalization has also faced opposition within Morocco [5, 11, 32]. Citizens and civil society groups have denounced the legitimation of the military occupation of Palestinian land [5]. The Moroccan Front for Supporting Palestine and Against Normalization was formed to protest against the normalization [5, 11]. The Justice and Development Party (PJD), a moderate Islamist party, also disapproved of the agreement [4, 21, 32].\n\n## The Western Sahara Dispute\n\nThe Western Sahara dispute dates back to the decolonization of the territory by Spain in the mid-1970s [15, 42, 43, 52]. Morocco claimed the territory in 1957 [10], and in 1975, Morocco and Mauritania pressured Spain to partition Western Sahara [10]. The Polisario Front declared the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) in 1976, leading to a prolonged war with Morocco [3, 10, 15, 42]. A UN-mediated ceasefire ended the war in 1991, but a referendum on independence has never been held [10, 15, 42]. The UN maintains a peacekeeping mission in the Western Sahara (MINURSO) [15, 27, 42, 52].\n\nThe international community remains divided on the issue of Western Sahara [3, 15, 16, 27, 29, 31, 39, 45, 51, 57, 58, 62]. The African Union recognizes the SADR [15, 42], while some Arab and African states have opened consulates in Western Sahara, implicitly recognizing Morocco's claims [14, 31, 38]. Algeria has long supported the Polisario Front [2, 15, 42, 44, 53] and cut off diplomatic ties with Morocco in August 2021, citing Morocco's relationship with Israel and support for banned organizations [14, 35].\n\n## Regional and International Reactions\n\nThe normalization of relations between Morocco and Israel and the recognition of Moroccan sovereignty over the Western Sahara have had significant regional and international implications [14, 21, 38, 47, 54, 57, 61]. The agreement has deepened rifts in the Maghreb region and worsened relations with the EU [21]. Spain shifted its position on the Western Sahara in March 2022, expressing support for Morocco's autonomy plan [54]. This decision led to criticism and regional consequences, particularly with Algeria [54].\n\nThe EU has maintained an ambiguous stance on Western Sahara [57], neither clearly accepting its status as occupied territory nor involving itself in the conflict's resolution [57]. The EU's fishing and agricultural agreements with Morocco designate Morocco as the de facto administrator of the territory [57].\n\nThe Abraham Accords and the related developments have also impacted the African Union [14]. Israel gained observer status in the AU in 2021, thanks to Morocco's support [14]. However, tensions between Algeria and Morocco contributed to Israel's expulsion from an AU ceremony in February 2023 [14].\n\n## Potential Future Developments\n\nThe long-term implications of Israel's recognition of Moroccan sovereignty over the Western Sahara remain uncertain [1, 20, 25, 33, 36, 39, 53, 57]. The Biden administration has not reversed the Trump administration's recognition [21, 25, 34], but some US political representatives criticize the decision [15, 16, 57]. The potential for a reversal of US policy remains a possibility [39, 57]. The ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas has also tested the strength of the normalization agreements [25, 33, 36]. The normalization process may slow down or freeze if the war continues and the humanitarian consequences worsen [36]. However, Morocco is unlikely to completely cut ties with Israel due to existing agreements and interests [36]. The future of the Western Sahara dispute and the role of Israel in the region will continue to be shaped by complex and evolving geopolitical dynamics [1, 18, 24, 37, 41, 46, 48, 50, 55, 56, 60, 62].",
