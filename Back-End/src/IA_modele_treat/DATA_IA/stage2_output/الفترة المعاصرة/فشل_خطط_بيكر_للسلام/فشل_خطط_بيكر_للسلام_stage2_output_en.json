  "article_text_raw": "# The Failure of the Baker Peace Plans\n\n## Background and Initial Efforts\n\nIn the early 1990s, the United States, under the leadership of Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, embarked on a series of diplomatic initiatives aimed at resolving the long-standing Arab-Israeli conflict [1]. These efforts gained momentum following the Gulf War, with the Bush administration seeking to leverage its influence in the region to foster a lasting peace [6, 18]. Baker's approach involved intense shuttle diplomacy, engaging with leaders from Israel, Palestine, Syria, Egypt, and Jordan [5]. The goal was to initiate direct negotiations between Israel and its Arab neighbors, as well as between Israel and the Palestinians [1].\n\nThe US aimed to act as the sole mediator in the Arab-Israeli conflict [6]. The Bush administration desired to control the peace process [6]. The initial alignment of US-Iraq interests due to their mutual opposition to Iran also played a role [6]. The US Administration intended to exhaust all peaceful means to resolve disputes in the region, but considered time 'not unlimited' regarding resolving disputes [6].\n\n## Obstacles and Disagreements\n\nDespite initial optimism, significant disagreements quickly emerged, hindering progress [1]. Key sticking points included the structure, agenda, timing, and Palestinian representation in the proposed peace talks [1]. Israel, under Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, initially agreed in principle to attend a regional peace meeting co-sponsored by Washington and Moscow [1]. However, Israel had previously resisted international conferences due to concerns about superpower and UN involvement diluting direct negotiations [1].\n\nBaker's plan aimed to satisfy both Arab demands for international cover and Israeli demands for direct talks [1]. However, American officials acknowledged that the Israeli conception of the meeting's structure differed significantly from their own and those of the Arabs and Palestinians [1]. Baker planned visits to Cairo and Syria to elicit reactions to his peace proposal from Egyptian, Saudi, and Syrian officials [1].\n\nPalestinian leaders insisted on the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) as their sole representative, while Israeli officials rejected the idea of a land-for-peace exchange [4]. King Hussein of Jordan was unwilling to substitute the PLO in talks with Israel but would consider joining talks if the Palestinian leadership requested it [4]. Baker urged Palestinian leaders to bypass the PLO and negotiate directly with Israel [4]. He also appealed to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to consider measures such as halting settlement construction, ending deportations of Palestinian militants, and not ruling out a land-for-peace exchange [4].\n\n## The Madrid Conference and its Aftermath\n\nDespite the challenges, Baker's efforts culminated in the Madrid Peace Conference, which convened in October 1991 [5, 19, 25, 31, 42, 58, 60, 71]. Baker believed Syrian participation in the Madrid Conference after the 1991 Gulf War was crucial [19]. Baker believed Assad's engagement in the Madrid Conference would legitimize the process and encourage other Arab partners [19]. The conference brought together representatives from Israel, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and the Palestinians [5, 25, 60]. The US provided 'letters of assurance' to Israel, addressing concerns about the Palestinian issue, a new regional order, the Golan Heights, Lebanon, and the US alliance [25]. The US 'letters of assurance' to the Palestinians mentioned the end of the Israeli occupation, legitimate political rights, the illegality of annexing East Jerusalem, opposition to settlement policies, and the possibility of a confederation [25]. US 'letters of assurance' to Syria referred to the principle of restitution of the Golan and understanding of Arab grievances like the annexation of Jerusalem-East and settlements [25]. US 'letters of assurance' to Lebanon addressed the implementation of Resolution 425 regarding Southern Lebanon [25].\n\nThe conference aimed to achieve a comprehensive resolution to all bilateral controversies and all multilateral issues of common interest [60]. However, deep divisions remained, and the conference did not produce any immediate breakthroughs [58]. The conference would not impose solutions, make decisions for the parties, or vote on any subject without unanimous agreement [25]. The conference included bilateral negotiations starting four days after the opening and multilateral negotiations two weeks later [25].\n\nFollowing the Madrid Conference, bilateral talks continued, but progress was slow and uneven [5]. The US sought to link the Israeli-Palestinian issue with broader Israeli-Arab relations [25]. The chronology of events from August 16 to November 15, 1991, details the intense diplomatic activity of U.S. Secretary of State James Baker as he attempts to secure the participation of Israel, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and the Palestinians [5]. The chronology covers numerous obstacles to peace, including Israeli settlement activity, disagreements over Palestinian representation, the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the occupied territories, and regional tensions [5].\n\n## The Settlement Issue and US-Israeli Tensions\n\nA major point of contention was the issue of Israeli settlement construction in the occupied territories [5, 18]. The Bush administration, led by James Baker, pressured the Shamir government to halt settlement construction, viewing it as an impediment to peace negotiations [18]. The US linked loan guarantees to Israel to a settlement freeze in 1991-1992 [18]. James Baker threatened that Israel would not receive 'a cent of bank guarantees' due to settlement activity [18]. On September 6, 1991, President Bush officially asked Congress for a 120-day delay before deciding on loan guarantees for Israel [18]. On September 12, 1991, George Bush threatened to veto aid to Israel if Congress approved it, citing pressure from a 'powerful lobby' [18]. In February 1992, James Baker formally and publicly linked the loan guarantees to the halt of settlement construction in the West Bank and Gaza [18].\n\nThis pressure led to significant tensions between the US and Israel [13, 18]. Shamir stated the U.S. had a 'moral obligation' to provide loan guarantees, and Israel would continue building settlements [5]. Shamir declared Bush's stance on loan guarantees constituted an attack on Jewish and Zionist consciousness and that Israel would not negotiate with Palestinians affiliated with the PLO [5]. The Israeli Labor party played on the restoration of the alliance with the United States and the promise of prosperity versus Shamir and his colonies in June 1992 elections [18]. Itzhak Rabin defeated Itzhak Shamir in the June 1992 elections, which some attributed to George Bush's pressure regarding settlements [18].\n\n## The PLO and Shifting Dynamics\n\nThe role of the PLO also remained a contentious issue [5, 11]. While the PLO conditionally accepted Baker's 5-point formula in December 1989 [11], Israel reiterated its opposition to PLO participation [11]. The US had interrupted dialogue with the PLO [28]. Husseini contended that the US believes the results of the Gulf war will allow it to ignore the PLO [28]. The Palestinian delegation, at the demand of the PLO, gave James Baker a memorandum that stated nothing will be accepted if it doesn't take their principles and revendications into consideration [28].\n\nThe US-Palestinian dialogue broke down on June 20, 1990 [17]. Arafat expressed frustration over the slowness of the peace process and said to Cairo weekly Al Mussawar if peace efforts stop he will \"immediately announce [his] resignation\" [11]. PLO member Salah Khalaf told reporters U.S.-PLO dialogue has reached a \"dead end;\" says PLO concessions have not brought any results [11].\n\n## The Intifada and Internal Israeli Politics\n\nThe ongoing Intifada, the Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories, further complicated the peace process [14, 18, 61]. The Intifada aimed to provoke a progressive transition to civil disobedience, including boycotts and resignations from civil administration [14]. The uprising led to the resignation of 300 police officers in the West Bank in March 1988 [14]. The Intifada's objectives included strengthening Palestinian identity, weakening Israel, influencing international opinion, and pressuring the OLP [61].\n\nInternal Israeli politics also played a significant role [2, 13]. Shamir faced opposition from within his Likud party, including ministers like Ariel Sharon [13]. Hardliners in the Likud party demanded explanations from Shamir regarding his conversations with Baker [13]. Former Prime Minister Menahem Begin stated that the Golan Heights 'is and will remain Israeli' [13]. Ultra-nationalist ministers from Tehiya, Tsomet, and Moledet were expected to move into the opposition if Shamir accepted the peace plan [13]. Shamir considered forming a coalition with the Labor party or dissolving the Knesset and calling for early elections [13].\n\n## The Golan Heights and Syrian Involvement\n\nSyria's participation was deemed crucial for the success of the peace process [19]. James Baker, US Secretary of State, believed Syrian participation in the Madrid Conference after the 1991 Gulf War was crucial [19]. Baker believed Assad's engagement in the Madrid Conference would legitimize the process and encourage other Arab partners [19]. However, Syria insisted on a full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights as a precondition for peace [5, 48]. James Baker reaffirmed that the US does not recognize the annexation of the Golan Heights [13]. Baker stated that the future talks should reference UN resolutions 242 and 338, concerning territories occupied since 1967 [13]. Shamir rejected the principle of 'peace for territories' contained in resolution 242 [13].\n\n## The Legacy of Failure\n\nUltimately, the Baker peace plans, while setting the stage for future negotiations, failed to achieve a comprehensive and lasting peace agreement [2, 17]. The deep-seated disagreements, the complexities of the regional dynamics, and the internal political pressures on all sides proved too difficult to overcome [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 13, 17, 18, 19]. The failure of the Baker plan contributed to a sense of impasse in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, paving the way for future cycles of violence and renewed efforts at peacemaking [20, 23]. The US administration vetoed the condemnation of the Richon-le-Zion attack [17]. A new Israeli government, opposed to the 'Baker plan,' was formed in Tel Aviv in the spring of 1990 [17]. The USSR's inability to counterbalance US influence and the opening of its borders contributed to a demographic shift against the Palestinians [17]. Over 100,000 Soviet immigrants were expected in Israel in 1990 [17].\n\nThe events surrounding the Baker Plan, the positions of different parties, and factors impacting its ultimate failure to materialize into tangible negotiations provide valuable insight into the complexities of the Arab-Israeli conflict and the challenges of achieving a lasting peace [5, 11].",
