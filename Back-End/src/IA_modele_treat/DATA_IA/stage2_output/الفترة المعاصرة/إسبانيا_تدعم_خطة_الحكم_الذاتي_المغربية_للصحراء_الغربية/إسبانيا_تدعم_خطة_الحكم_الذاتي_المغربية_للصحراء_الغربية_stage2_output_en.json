  "article_text_raw": "# Spain's Support for Morocco's Autonomy Plan for Western Sahara\n\n## Historical Context of the Western Sahara Conflict\n\nThe Western Sahara conflict stems from the incomplete decolonization of the former Spanish colony [74]. Spain colonized the territory in 1884, specifically the Rio de Oro peninsula [42, 82]. In 1961, Spain became the administrator under Chapter XI of the UN Charter, recognizing the right to self-determination of the inhabitants through a referendum [63]. However, Morocco and Mauritania contested this position, claiming pre-existing legal links to the territories before Spanish colonization [63]. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) considered the legal status of Western Sahara, specifically whether it was a *terra nullius* at the time of Spanish colonization [63, 69]. The ICJ found legal links of allegiance between the Sultan of Morocco and certain tribes in Western Sahara, but deemed these insufficient to establish territorial sovereignty [69].\n\nIn November 1975, the Madrid Accords were signed between Spain, Morocco, and Mauritania, leading to Spain's transfer of the Western Sahara territory to Morocco and Mauritania after a brief transition period [37, 42, 82]. Spain transferred the administration, but not the sovereignty, of the Sahara to Morocco and Mauritania [37]. The UN acknowledged the Madrid Accords (resolution 345 B of December 10, 1975) but also called for the Sahrawis' right to self-determination (resolution 345 A of the same date) [37]. The Madrid Agreement proposed an exploitation scheme for the phosphate deposits with 65% participation by Morocco and 35% by Spain [42].\n\nOn February 26, 1976, the last Spanish official left the Sahara, and Morocco and Mauritania took possession of the territory [37]. The Polisario Front, formed in 1973 [40], declared the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) on February 27, 1976, and has been fighting for its independence since then [29, 40]. The Madrid Agreement was rejected by Algeria and the Polisario Front [42].\n\n## The Autonomy Plan and International Positions\n\nMorocco has presented an autonomy plan for Western Sahara as a solution to the conflict [6, 7, 22, 29, 38, 41, 43, 54, 61, 66, 68, 77, 85]. This initiative aims to define the broad outlines for Sahrawi autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty [6]. The Moroccan Initiative for Negotiating an Autonomy Statute for the Sahara Region was introduced in April 2007 and has been the subject of debate within the international community [6]. The Moroccan autonomy proposal submitted to the UN on April 11, 2007, guaranteed an autonomous region while Morocco maintained control over sovereign domains [31]. The Polisario Front rejected the autonomy plan, continuing to advocate for self-determination for the Sahrawi population at the UN [31].\n\nThe United States officially backed Morocco’s sovereignty over the Sahara in December 2020 under President Donald Trump [3, 29]. The Biden administration has not reversed this recognition [12, 29]. France has confirmed an alignment with the Moroccan proposal, describing it as “the only basis for achieving a just, lasting and negotiated political solution” [3]. The United Kingdom, Germany, and the Netherlands have also publicly supported the Moroccan autonomy plan [3].\n\n## Spain's Evolving Position\n\nSpain's policy on Western Sahara has evolved over time [53, 75]. In February 1976, Spain's official statement reflected the government's inability to abide by international norms on self-determination [24]. Spain's policy was described as 'constructive neutrality' [24]. However, Spain has also shown sympathies towards the Moroccan Autonomy Plan [24].\n\nOn March 18, 2022, Spanish President Pedro Sánchez declared that he recognized the Moroccan Autonomy Plan presented to the UN in 2007 for the Western Sahara as “the most serious, realistic, and credible basis for resolving the dispute” [31, 32]. This decision marked a shift from the PSOE's 2019 electoral program, which advocated for a solution respecting the Sahrawi people’s right to self-determination and encouraging dialogue between Morocco and the Polisario Front [31]. The Spanish government described this shift as a paradigm shift in its North Africa policy, marking a new phase in relations between Spain and Morocco based on mutual respect and transparency [29].\n\nSpain's support for the Moroccan autonomy initiative was formalized in a joint declaration between Spain and Morocco issued on April 7, 2022 [32]. The declaration explicitly states that Spain recognizes the importance of the Western Sahara issue for Morocco and considers the Moroccan autonomy initiative, presented in 2007, as the most serious, realistic, and credible basis for resolving the dispute [8, 32]. The declaration emphasizes transparency, dialogue, and mutual respect in the bilateral relationship [32].\n\n## Motivations and Consequences of Spain's Shift\n\nSeveral factors contributed to Spain's decision to support the Moroccan autonomy plan [27, 31, 50, 54, 71, 72, 83]. The declaration followed a diplomatic crisis between Spain and Morocco, heightened by Spain's April 21, 2021, decision to receive Brahim Ghali, President of the RASD, in Saragossa [31]. In May 2021, Morocco withdrew its ambassador to Spain and eased border restrictions with Ceuta, leading to an influx of migrants into Spanish territory [14, 27]. Spain agreed to support Morocco's autonomy proposal for the Western Sahara in March 2022 following the Ceuta border incident [27].\n\nThe shift in Spain's position highlights the informal dimensions of bilateral agreements and Morocco's ability to use migration issues to integrate negotiations into its own political agenda [50]. Spain's decision was also influenced by the United States, particularly by Wendy Sherman, the US Deputy Secretary of State [72].\n\nThe Spanish government's decision was met with parliamentary disapproval [31, 84]. The PP spokesperson, Cuca Gamarra, criticized the PSOE's unilateral decision to change Spain's traditional consensus position without informing the main opposition party on March 18, 2022 [31]. The decision also caused a diplomatic crisis with Algeria, leading to the recall of the Algerian Ambassador in Madrid for consultations [29, 72, 84]. Algeria unilaterally decided to close the GME gas pipeline on October 31, 2021, which has impacted Spain’s gas imports [31].\n\n## Implications and Future Outlook\n\nSpain's support for the Moroccan autonomy plan has significant implications for the Western Sahara conflict and regional stability [71, 84]. The shift in Spain's position highlights the complex interplay of historical responsibilities, geopolitical interests, and domestic political considerations [75, 81]. Spain needs to seek a new equilibrium in its relationship with both Morocco and Algeria, adhering to UN dispositions and international law [84]. The EU Court of Justice is expected to rule on the applicability of EU-Morocco trade and fishing agreements to Western Sahara resources [84]. The future of the Western Sahara remains uncertain, with the need for a just and lasting political solution that respects the rights and aspirations of the Sahrawi people [33].",
