  "article_text_raw": "# Algeria Severing Diplomatic Ties with Morocco over Western Sahara\n\n## Background to Algerian-Moroccan Relations\n\nThe relationship between Algeria and Morocco has historically been complex and often strained, marked by mutual mistrust and grievances [1]. A key point of contention is the issue of Western Sahara, with Algeria supporting the POLISARIO Front, which seeks independence for the territory, while Morocco claims sovereignty [2]. This support has been a major source of friction between the two nations [2, 35, 41]. The roots of their rivalry can be traced back to border disputes following Algeria's independence, including the Sands War in October 1963 [2].\n\nNumerous attempts at reconciliation and regional integration have been made, most notably the establishment of the Arab Maghreb Union (AMU) in February 1989, which included Algeria, Morocco, Libya, Tunisia, and Mauritania [2]. The AMU aimed to create a common economic market, facilitate the free movement of people and goods, and establish a customs union [2]. However, the AMU has been effectively moribund due to the ongoing conflict in Western Sahara and the rivalry between Algeria and Morocco for regional hegemony [20, 21].\n\n## The Western Sahara Dispute\n\nThe Western Sahara dispute is central to the strained relationship between Algeria and Morocco [20, 21]. The territory, formerly a Spanish colony, was annexed by Morocco in 1975, leading to a conflict with the POLISARIO Front [4, 13]. Algeria has consistently supported the POLISARIO's quest for self-determination [2, 3, 40]. Approximately 150,000 Sahrawi refugees reside in camps near Tindouf, Algeria, having fled Western Sahara after the Moroccan annexation [4, 9, 14, 24, 53, 56].\n\nIn 1991, a UN-brokered ceasefire was established between Morocco and the POLISARIO Front, with the understanding that a referendum would be held to allow Sahrawis to decide their future [4, 5, 24]. However, this referendum has not taken place, leading to continued tensions and frustration among Sahrawi refugees [4]. The UN maintains a mission, MINURSO, in Western Sahara since 1991 to monitor the ceasefire and work towards a resolution [5, 24, 34]. France participates in MINURSO [5].\n\n## Escalating Tensions and Diplomatic Rupture\n\nThe conflict over Western Sahara has repeatedly led to diplomatic crises between Algeria and Morocco. In March 1976, diplomatic relations were initially broken off, and thousands of citizens were expelled from each country [2]. Relations were re-established in May 1988 [2, 27]. However, tensions persisted. In August 1994, Morocco accused Algeria of being behind a terrorist attack in Marrakech and imposed visa requirements on Algerian tourists, leading to Algeria closing the border [2, 30]. The border has remained largely closed since then [2].\n\nIn October 2017, Morocco recalled its ambassador to Algeria due to insulting comments allegedly made by Algerian Minister of Foreign Affairs Abdelkader Messahel [2]. In May 2018, Morocco accused Iran and Hezbollah of providing missiles to the POLISARIO with Algeria's support, which Algeria denied [2, 7, 8].\n\nThese long-standing tensions, exacerbated by the unresolved Western Sahara issue, ultimately led to Algeria severing diplomatic ties with Morocco. While the exact date of this final rupture is not specified in the provided sources, the historical context clearly indicates the culmination of decades of animosity and disagreement.\n\n## Regional and International Implications\n\nThe Algerian-Moroccan rivalry has significant implications for regional stability and integration in the Maghreb [2, 20, 21]. The failure of the AMU is partly attributed to this ongoing conflict [20, 21, 30]. The rivalry also affects security in the Sahel region [2].\n\nThe Western Sahara issue has drawn in various international actors, including the United Nations, the United States, France, and Spain [5, 10, 34, 46, 47, 48, 49]. Saudi Arabia has attempted mediation between Algeria and Morocco in the past [6]. Spain, as the former colonial power, has a particular interest in the resolution of the conflict [42, 46, 47, 49, 52]. The United States considers Morocco a constructive actor in the peace process [34]. France has historically maintained close ties with Morocco [5, 31].\n\nThe ongoing dispute also impacts migration patterns in the region [15, 22, 23]. Both Algeria and Morocco are emigration, transit, and immigration countries [23]. Morocco has been more proactive in engaging with European countries on migration management, while Algeria has adopted a more security-focused approach [23].\n\n## The Sahrawi People and Their Struggle\n\nThe Sahrawi people have been significantly affected by the Western Sahara conflict [4, 9, 14, 17, 18, 20, 24, 40, 53, 55, 56]. The Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR), proclaimed by the POLISARIO Front in 1976, has been recognized by numerous states [12, 40]. Sahrawi refugees in the Tindouf camps continue to advocate for self-determination [4, 9, 14, 17, 18, 20, 24, 53, 55, 56]. Sahrawi music and culture play a vital role in maintaining national identity and resistance [9, 24]. The \"Vacaciones en Paz\" program allows Sahrawi children to spend summers with Spanish families, providing medical care and strengthening the Sahrawi cause [56].",
