  "article_text_raw": "# The Saadian Conquest of Morocco\n\n## Background and Origins\n\nThe Saadian dynasty, claiming descent from the prophet Muhammad, emerged in Morocco in the early 16th century [13, 15]. Unlike previous dynasties such as the Almoravids, Almohads, and Marinids, the Saadians did not rely on *'asabiyya* (esprit de corps) for their rise to power [37]. The Almoravids depended on the Sanhâja confederation, the Almohads on the Masmûda, and the Marinids on the Zanâta confederation [37]. The Saadians originated in the Dra valley, specifically the Zagora region, in the 12th or 13th century [18, 26]. The political and ideological situation in Morocco around 1510 favored their emergence [37]. The Saadians were Arabs, and their rule initiated a political, economic, and intellectual renaissance [4].\n\n## Rise to Power and Consolidation\n\nPortuguese enterprises on the Moroccan coast spurred a Muslim resurgence, contributing to the Saadians' rise [26]. In 1511, Moulay Abd er-Rahmane was chosen as the Saadian war leader [26]. The Saadians gained control of Marrakech in 1525 [26]. In 1545, they captured the Wattasid sultan of Fès [26]. Mohammed ech-Cheikh took Fès, solidifying the Saadian dynasty [26]. The Saadian dynasty is described as a state of Jihad [3]. The Saadians captured Fes in 1549, marking the start of their hegemony over Morocco [19]. Taroudant served as the Saadian capital from 1520 to 1541 before they favored Marrakech [28].\n\n## Key Figures and Events\n\nMuhammad al-Mahdî, the founder of the Saadian dynasty, bore the Fatimid title of al-Qâ'im bi-amr Allâh and rose to power with a messianic mission [15]. His campaign was initiated by a holy man, 'Abd Allâh ibn Mubârak [15]. Muhammad al-Mahdi was believed to have played a preaching role for his sons Ahmad and Muhammad [15].\n\nAhmad al-Mansur reigned as Saadian caliph from 1578 to 1603 [13]. He ascended to the sultanate during the battle 'des trois rois' (Battle of the Three Kings) [13]. Al-Fistali, a contemporary chronicler and vizir, documented Ahmad al-Mansur's early education in his book *Manahil al-Òafa fi aÌbar al-muluk al-surafa’* [13]. Ahmad al-Mansur's early education took place in Fes, Marrakech, and Sus [13]. Al-Dar‘ i, imam of the mosque of Fès, instructed Ahmad al-Mansur in the Quran in Fes [13].\n\nThe Battle of Wadi al-Makhazin (also known as the Battle of Alcácer Quibir or Battle of the Three Kings) occurred on August 4, 1578 [3, 21, 43]. This battle was one of the bloodiest and most devastating in 16th-century military history [21]. The battle took place near Kasr el-Kebir, between the left bank of the Vâdilmehâzin river and the right bank of the Wadi Lukos [21]. D. Sebastião I of Portugal engaged in the Battle of Alcazarquivir in Morocco, after receiving a request for help from Abu Abdallah Mohammed II Saadi [43].\n\n## Expansion and Influence\n\nAhmad al-Mansur launched an expedition of conquest against Tombouctou [13]. On February 28, 1591, a Moroccan army reached Niger after 135 days of travel from Marrakesh [1]. The Moroccan army was sent by Ahmad al-Mansur to defeat Askiah Ishaq II, the king of Songhay [1]. The battle between the Moroccan and Songhay armies took place on March 13, 1591 [1]. The Moroccan army's superior weaponry and discipline led to the slaughter of the Songhay army [1]. Following the defeat, 'Sudan' (the land of the Blacks) submitted to Morocco [1]. Sudan sent a tribute of 100,000 pieces of gold and 1,000 slaves to Marrakesh [1]. Sudan also promised an annual *khiraj*/tribute to Morocco [1]. Ahmad al-Mansur was given the epithet *al-Dhahabi* (the golden) due to the large quantities of gold he received [1]. After the victory of 1591, the Moroccans dominated the Sudan for nearly seventy years [30].\n\nThe Moroccan army's conquest of the Askia Empire in 1591 was led by Yuder Pachá, an Andalusian from Cuevas de Almanzora [42]. The army crossed the Sahara and won the battle of Tondibi near Gao in modern-day Mali [42]. The conquerors, known as Armas, established a solid political structure that allowed their descendants to dominate the Niger River Bend until the Peul Empire of Masina in 1833 [42]. The Armas intermarried with local aristocratic women and adopted local customs [42].\n\n## Internal Affairs and Cultural Developments\n\nThe Saadian state is credited with efforts to maintain sciences and potentially re-establish public institutions, including Bimaristans (hospitals) [3]. A Bimaristan in Marrakesh is attributed to the Saadian Sultan Abdallah al-Ghalib (1557-1574) in 1564 [3]. The Saadian kings used sugar to pay for Carrara marble imported from Italy for the construction of palaces in Marrakech, including the Badi Palace [17]. They paid 'weight for weight' in sugar for the Italian marble [17].\n\nAhmad al-Mansur initiated a rehabilitation program in Sijilmasa, including the rebuilding of the great mosque [6]. Saadian Sultan Ahmed-Ed-Dahabi (1578–1603) approved the construction of the mellah (Jewish quarter) in Marrakesh near the Royal Palace [8].\n\nThe Saadian dynasty, unlike the Fatimids and Almohads, relied on firearms and a regular army, not a new religious community [15]. Abd el-Melek and Ahmed (later El Mansour) lived in exile in Istanbul and served the successors of Suleiman the Magnificent [18]. The court of El Mansour resembled the Ottoman court, with similar access to high palace positions [18]. The Saadian sultans adopted the Ottoman organization for their army and made use of Christian renegades [18].\n\n## Interactions with Other Powers\n\nThe Saadian dynasty successfully resisted Portuguese and Spanish attempts at domination [27]. The 16th century saw the consolidation of Turkish power in the central and eastern Maghreb [26]. The Spanish monarchy reached its peak under Philip II during the 16th century [26].\n\nMorocco under Ahmad al-Mansur represented a frontier territory that absorbed expelled peoples, such as the Jews and Muslims of Granada, and integrated them as technicians, merchants and consultants to the administration [9]. Ahmad Ibn Qāsim Al-Ḥajarī, a Morisco who left Spain before the Edict of Expulsion, served as an emissary of the Sultan of Morocco and his sons (Saadian dynasty) [9]. The Moroccan Saadian court employed Al-Ḥajarī as a translator and ambassador [9].\n\n## Decline and Legacy\n\nThe Saadian dynasty fell in 1659 [19]. The Alaouites, who came from Tafilalet, eventually supplanted the Saadiens [28]. Alaouite successors denigrated the Saadians, questioning their Sharifian ancestry [26]. The Almohad period was less interesting to the Cherifian dynasties of Morocco, including the Saadiens and Alaouites (16th-19th centuries) [25].",
