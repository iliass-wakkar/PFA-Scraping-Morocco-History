  "article_text_raw": "# Sieges of Spanish Cities: A Historical Overview\n\n## Ancient and Medieval Sieges\n\nThe history of the Iberian Peninsula is marked by numerous sieges, dating back to ancient times. The sieges of Saguntum (218 BCE) and Numantia (134-133 BCE) stand as legendary national landmarks, representing heroic resistance against invaders [8]. The siege of Saguntum by Hannibal in 219 BC, which escalated into the Second Punic War, and the siege of Numantia by the Roman Empire became symbols of perseverance and heroic defense [8, 10]. The Roman perspective on the siege of Saguntum was often exaggerated for ideological purposes [10]. The Celtiberian settlement of Numantia, near modern Soria, chose suicide and destruction over surrender to Scipio Aemilianus in 133 BCE [8, 55]. This act of defiance has been reinterpreted throughout Spanish history to inspire resistance against foreign powers and promote national unity [55]. Cervantes's play, *La destrucción de la Numancia*, reflects the public's fascination with sieges and stages elements of positional warfare as dramatic tropes [9].\n\nDuring the Reconquista, the siege and conquest of Cordoba in 1236 by King Fernando III of Castile-Leon marked a significant Christian victory [11]. Christian forces initially captured the suburbs of Cordoba, called 'el Axerquía', and later, with reinforcements, took control of the city after the death of the Moorish king Ibn Hūd [11].\n\n## Sieges in the Late Middle Ages and Early Modern Period\n\nIn 1489, during the War of Granada (1482-1492), the Catholic Monarchs, Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon, strategically besieged cities like Madinat Basta (Baza) to secure the surrender of the Nasrid dynasty's capital, Madinat Garnata (Granada) and Madina Alhambra (Alhambra) [21]. The siege of Baza, lasting from mid-June to early December 1489, was one of the most challenging campaigns, employing tactics inspired by Scipio Africanus the Younger's siege of Numantia [21].\n\nThe 16th and 17th centuries saw continued sieges in Spain and Spanish-held territories. The siege of Fuenterrabía in 1638, during the Franco-Spanish War (1635-1659), highlights the strategic importance of this Basque city [16]. The siege of Barcelona in 1652 during the Reapers' War led to the analysis of ancient DNA from Spanish soldiers who died during the siege, revealing insights into their ancestry and potential causes of death [30].\n\nThe War of the Spanish Succession (1702-1712) brought further sieges, including the Bourbon siege of Barcelona in 1706, where Archduke Charles led the city's resistance [5, 29]. The Duke of Berwick played a significant role in securing the Spanish crown for Philip V, including his participation in the siege of Barcelona in 1714 [57]. The siege of Lille, a key event in the War of the Spanish Succession, involved Spanish forces [26]. The Siege of Saint-Quentin in 1557 also involved Spanish forces [27].\n\n## Sieges in the 18th and 19th Centuries\n\nThe 18th century saw the Spanish involved in sieges across Europe and the Americas. The Siege of Carthagena is discussed in the context of the French struggle for the West Indies [39]. The Great Siege of Gibraltar, lasting from 1779 to 1783, was a major Spanish effort to regain the British colony [86, 107]. Despite significant efforts, including the use of floating batteries designed by a French engineer, Spain ultimately failed to recapture Gibraltar [107].\n\nDuring the Peninsular War (1808-1814), sieges became a defining characteristic of the conflict [4, 50, 64, 65, 74, 103, 105, 117]. The sieges of cities like Zaragoza and Gerona became symbols of Spanish resistance against Napoleon's forces [31, 50, 65, 70, 74, 117]. The role of Irish soldiers in the defense of Girona is also noteworthy [31]. The British sieges of Ciudad Rodrigo and Badajoz in 1812 were crucial for facilitating the British advance into Spain, though they resulted in high casualty rates [4]. The siege and sack of Castro Urdiales in 1813 by Franco-Italian forces resulted in significant civilian casualties and destruction [45, 46]. The siege of San Sebastian also ended with an Allied sack [6, 45, 117].\n\nThe Carlist Wars of the 19th century also involved sieges, though details are scarce in the provided sources. The siege of Cartagena (1873-1874) during the cantonal revolution marked a difficult time in Spain, with internal disorder and military indiscipline [25, 110].\n\n## Sieges and Cultural Memory\n\nThe sieges of Spanish cities have had a lasting impact on Spanish culture and national identity. The sieges of Saguntum and Numantia have been immortalized in literature and art, serving as symbols of heroic resistance [8, 9, 55]. Cervantes's play, *El gallardo español*, recounts the siege of Oran and Mers El Kébir in 1563, reflecting the complex relationship between Spain and Algeria [44, 47]. Albert Camus's play, *L'État de Siège*, uses the Spanish city of Cadiz as the setting for a story about a city under siege by the Plague [48]. The Sieges of Zaragoza became a myth symbolizing the resistance [95].\n\n## Urban Planning and Military Considerations\n\nMilitary considerations have often shaped urban planning in Spain. The *traza italiana* (star fort) shifted military strategy towards the attack and defense of heavily fortified citadels [9]. Cities like Perpignan underwent significant urban and military evolutions due to their strategic importance as frontier towns [49]. The fortifications of the Gonzaga family in Italy, particularly in Mantua and Casale, demonstrate the importance of fortifications in early modern warfare and their impact on Spanish and Habsburg forces [34].\n\n## The Impact of Sieges on Civilians\n\nSieges often had devastating consequences for civilian populations. The siege of Tenochtitlan, while not in Spain itself, highlights the brutal impact of siege warfare on indigenous populations [23]. The siege of Leningrad, though far from Spain, serves as a parallel to the siege of Bilbao, highlighting the tragic loss of civilian life and the impact of war [40, 120]. The siege of Castro Urdiales in 1813 resulted in a three-day sacking and the massacre of many inhabitants [45, 46]. The siege of Girona in 1809 led to famine, disease, and a significant reduction in the city's population [31].",
