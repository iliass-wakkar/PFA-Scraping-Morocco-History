  "article_text_raw": "# The Saadian Civil War (1603-1627)\n\n## Background and Origins\n\nThe Saadian dynasty ruled Morocco from 1549 to 1659 [3]. The dynasty took full power in Morocco around 1554 [7]. The Saadian Empire's establishment occurred over a half century through military action, eliminating the Wattasids [13]. The Saadian dynasty saw some Turkish influence, starting from the reign of al-Mahdi and extending to al-Mançûr's era [13]. The Saadian dynasty faced struggles against Spanish and Portuguese occupations in the north and the Ottomans in the east [7]. The dynasty won the Battle of Oued Almakhazine (Battle of the Three Kings) [7]. The Saadian empire reached its peak under al-Mançûr after 75 years of struggles and war [13]. Ahmad al-Mansur reigned from 1578 to 1603 [9].\n\nAhmad al-Mansûr's death in 1603 triggered a civil war among his heirs, creating instability [8]. The civil war occurred during a period of dynastic change, with the decline of the Saadian dynasty and the rise of the Alaouites [6]. The internal political complexities of Morocco, including Saadian claimants, influenced the conflict [6]. The Spanish occupation of Larache occurred during this period of Saadian decline [6].\n\n## The Succession Crisis and Key Players\n\nAhmad al-Mansur gained the throne after the Battle of the Three Kings on August 4, 1578 [9]. Prior to becoming Sultan, Ahmad al-Mansur served as his brother Abd al-Malik's representative in Fez [9]. Ahmad al-Mansur faced challenges from his son, Muhammad al-Shaykh al-Ma'mun, which prompted him to solidify ties with the ulema in Fez [9].\n\nThe death of Ahmad al-Mansûr in 1603 led to a power struggle between his sons, most notably Mawlây Zaydân and others [8]. This succession crisis plunged Morocco into a period of intense conflict and fragmentation [8].\n\n## Key Events and Conflicts\n\nIn 1610, Mawlây al-Shaykh, a son of Ahmad al-Mansûr, ceded Larache to Spain for military aid, a situation that fueled criticism of the Saadian dynasty [8]. The Spanish occupied Larache from 1610-1689 [6]. In 1610, Ibn Abî Mahallî led a group to conquer Sijilmasa, expelling the Saadian governor and army [8]. Ibn Abî Mahallî, believing himself to be the Mahdi, conquered the Dra' region, crossed the Atlas, and seized Marrakech, the Saadian capital [8]. On May 20, 1612, Ibn Abî Mahallî defeated Mawlây Zaydân and entered Marrakech, proclaiming a general pardon by the mandate of 'Muley Mahamete ben Abdala, King of all the Universe' [8].\n\nIbn Abî Mahallî's rule ended with his death in battle in 1613 against the supporters of Saadian Sultan Mawlây Zaydân, who then retook Marrakech [8]. After his death, Ibn Abî Mahallî's head was displayed on the walls of Marrakech until it disintegrated [8]. The faqîh Yahyâ b. Abd Allâh al-Hahî, a former friend of Ibn Abî Mahallî, led a campaign against him and ultimately defeated and killed Ibn Abî Mahallî in October 1613 (Ramadân 1022) [8]. After defeating Ibn Abî Mahallî, Sîdî Yahyâ entered Marrakech and initially occupied the royal palace, but later withdrew, ceding the power back to Mawlây Zaydân [8]. The Saadian sultan Mawlây Zaydân asked Sîdî Yahyâ for support against Ibn Abî Mahallî, which led to the battle in which Ibn Abî Mahallî was killed [8].\n\nDuring the civil war between the Saadian brothers in the early 17th century, Morocco suffered droughts, famines, and a plague, further destabilizing the region [8].\n\n## External Involvement and Impact\n\nThe Spanish and Ottoman empires were both vying for influence in the region during this period [12]. The Spanish maintained presidios in North Africa, such as Oran and Mers-el-Kébir, monitoring the Moroccan sultans [12]. The Dutch and English governments were also engaged in diplomatic and trade discussions with Morocco [16]. In 1610, Mawlây al-Shaykh ceded Larache to the spanish [8].\n\n## Consequences and Legacy\n\nThe Saadian Civil War weakened the dynasty and contributed to its eventual decline [6]. The war also had a significant impact on Moroccan society, economy, and political landscape [8]. The instability created by the conflict allowed for the rise of maraboutic figures and contributed to the fragmentation of the country [6]. The Saadian dynasty ruled Morocco from the second half of the 16th century until 1659 [9]. By 1670, the Arma pledged allegiance to the Alaouite sultans but revoked Moroccan suzerainty by the early eighteenth century [2].",
