  "article_text_raw": "# The British Presence in Tangier and its Fluctuations\n\n## Early British Involvement and the Garrison Period\n\nThe British presence in Tangier dates back to the 17th century, with Lancelot Addison serving as chaplain to the British garrison there from 1662 to 1670 [8]. Chapter 1 of Eric Gruber von Arni's book, \"Hospital Care and the British Standing Army, 1660–1714,\" focuses specifically on \"The Garrison Hospital at Tangier, 1662–1683,\" indicating a direct link to the British presence in Tangier during that period [10].\n\n## Abandonment and Subsequent Moroccan Diplomacy\n\nAfter the British abandoned Tangier, the city opened to all nations for trade in January 1782 by Sultan Sidi Mohammed [20]. This transformation followed the English departure and created a site favorable to piracy, according to Louis de Chénier [20]. In 1783, Mohamed ben Abdel Malek's embassy to Vienna led to a treaty of commerce and amity between Morocco and Austria [20]. The Moroccan ambassador departed from Tangier on September 15, 1782 [20].\n\n## 19th Century Consular Presence and British Interests\n\nIn the early 19th century, Tangier was inhabited by Rifis, Jews, and a small European population [2]. Edward Drummond-Hay served as a British consul in Tangier [2]. He kept commonplace books noting events in Tangier and revealing his dislike of Islam [2]. In 1839, George Borrow visited Tangier, and Drummond-Hay expressed negative opinions about the inhabitants [2]. Tangier was involved in a thriving contraband trade along the Mediterranean coast of Morocco [2]. Approximately 20% of the population of Tangier was Jewish in the first part of the 19th century [2]. James Simpson, a Scotsman, served as U.S. consul first to Gibraltar and then to Tangier [13]. Simpson had virtually no opportunity to pursue mercantile activity due to the paucity of shipping in Tangier in the 1790s [13].\n\nIn 1844, French forces bombarded Tangier after the Moroccan government failed to effectively support 'Abd al-Qadir [2, 19]. General Bugeaud bombarded Tangier and Mogador (Essaouira) to paralyze Moroccan commercial activities as a punishment for hosting Emir Abdelkader [19].\n\nBritain intervened in the War of Africa (1859-1860) due to concerns about its command of the Western Mediterranean [5]. Tangier was important to Britain as a beef market for Gibraltar [5]. British Ambassador Andrew Buchanan emphasized the importance of Tangier's commerce with British possessions in the Mediterranean [5].\n\nIn 1882, José Maceo, a leader of the Cuban War of Independence, escaped from prison in Cadiz and fled to Tangier [27, 28, 34]. From Tangier, Maceo boarded a steamer to Gibraltar, intending to travel to the United States [27, 28]. However, upon arrival in Gibraltar, the British Chief of Police handed Maceo and his comrades over to the Guardia Civil, a Spanish law enforcement organization [27, 28]. This caused embarrassment to the British government [27, 28].\n\n## The International Zone and Shifting Power Dynamics\n\nFrom 1923, Tangier was made an international zone under the joint administration of France, Spain, and Great Britain [14]. This statute lasted until 1940 [14]. The international statute of Tangier was definitively defined at the end of 1923 [29]. In 1912, the establishment of the Spanish Protectorate in Morocco, encompassing the Rif, Yebala regions, and the city of Tangier, resulted in a significant increase in the Spanish population [43].\n\nIn 1940, Spain occupied Tangier, incorporating it into the Spanish Protectorate, taking advantage of the collapse of France [26, 31, 37, 44]. Great Britain, despite its interest in the area, prioritized other interests and accepted the Spanish occupation of Tangier [26, 30]. Britain pursued a policy of appeasement and provided economic aid to Franco's Spain [26]. An Anglo-Spanish agreement was established regarding Tangier, preserving commercial freedom and the freedom of movement for the British colony [26]. This agreement was repeatedly violated by the Spanish [26].\n\nDuring World War II, Tangier became an important base for Allied secret services to infiltrate French Morocco (controlled by Vichy) [26]. Tangier also became a significant center for espionage and political propaganda for the Axis powers, especially Germany [26, 25]. The German consulate in Tangier was used for secret activities, facilitated by the Franco government [26].\n\nIn May 1944, a secret agreement was reached between the Franco government, the United States, and England [35]. Spain agreed to limit wolfram exports to Germany and close the German consulate in Tangier, expelling all its personnel [30, 35]. In return, Britain and the United States committed to resuming oil supplies to Spain [35]. An Anglo-Spanish agreement was established in April 1944, where the Franco regime agreed to limit the export of wolframio, monitor contraband, close the German Consulate in Tangier, and facilitate the departure of its personnel [31].\n\nFrom 1940 to 1945, Tangier was incorporated into the Spanish zone of Morocco but was then restored to its international status [14]. Spain abandoned the administration of Tangier, which returned to international control between 1945 and 1956 [37].\n\n## Moroccan Independence and the End of the International Zone\n\nAfter October 1956, Tangier was no longer an International Zone [11]. In 1956, Tangier lost its international statute and joined the Kingdom of Morocco [14]. In 1961 it became part of Morocco [11]. In 1957 the British Post Office closed its offices in Tangier [11]. In 1958, the Spanish Post Office also closed its offices in Tangier [11]. After Tangier was no longer an International Zone, many Moroccans moved to Tangier, which changed the city space [11]. The article highlights the shift from a cosmopolitan city to a more Muslim-dominated space after Tangier's integration into Morocco [11].\n\nFollowing Moroccan independence in 1956, the Spanish population in Morocco started to decline [43].",
