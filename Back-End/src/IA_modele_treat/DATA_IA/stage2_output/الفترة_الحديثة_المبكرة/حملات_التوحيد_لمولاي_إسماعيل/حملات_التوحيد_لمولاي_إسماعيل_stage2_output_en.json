  "article_text_raw": "# Mawlay Ismail's Unification Campaigns in Morocco\n\n## Consolidation of Power and Territorial Unification\n\nMawlay Ismail, who reigned from 1672 to 1727, played a crucial role in the definitive unification of Morocco [7]. He consolidated his control over the country and marshaled its military capabilities to a remarkable degree [2]. The Alaouite dynasty, to which Mawlay Ismail belonged, occupied Marrakech in 1659, effectively ending the existence of the two previous large kingdoms [7]. Before this definitive unification, European texts referred to Morocco using the names of various territorial entities, primarily the kingdoms of Fez and Morocco [7]. The definitive incorporation of these two kingdoms occurred during Mawlay Ismail's long reign [7]. After his reign, the name \"Morocco\" came to represent the whole country in European languages and was used in diplomatic treaties signed by the Alawite dynasty [7].\n\n## Military Campaigns and Foreign Policy\n\nMawlay Ismail's reign was marked by numerous military campaigns and a complex foreign policy, particularly concerning Algeria and the Ottoman Empire [2]. Relations with Algeria were characterized by frequent clashes and short-lived truces [2]. In 1679, a force led by Mawlay Ismail was defeated by the Algerians [2]. In 1682, a Moroccan expedition pillaged the Banī ʿĀmir tribe in Algerian territory [2]. In 1688, the Algerian \"Turks\" came to Mawlay Ismail to conclude peace [2]. In 1692, another Moroccan force moved against Algeria but was checked, leading to a truce [2]. In 1694, Moroccan forces raided Algerian territory while the dey of Algiers dealt with Tunis [2]. In 1695-96, a Moroccan expedition commanded by Mawlay Ismail's son Aḥmad was defeated by the Algerians, prompting Mawlay Ismail to redeploy forces from the Ceuta siege [2]. In 1696, Mawlay Ismail concluded another truce with the Algerians, aided by a letter from the Ottoman Sultan [2]. In 1699-1700, Mawlay Ismail's son, Zaydān, led a foray into the Tlemcen area but concluded a truce, angering his father [2]. In 1701, Mawlay Ismail undertook an expedition into Algeria but was defeated by the dey of Algiers [2]. In 1707, Mawlay Ismail again entered Algeria, reportedly seeking to take Oran, but was defeated by Spanish forces [2].\n\nMawlay Ismail sought the Ottoman Sultan's intervention to influence Algerian policy and wanted recognition of Morocco's predominance in the region [2]. He sought to enlist the Ottoman Sultan’s benevolence and encourage a divide between the Porte and the Algerian regency [2]. He also sought to confirm his equality with the Ottoman Sultan in terms of protocol, prestige, and in the important field of the jihad [2]. Mawlay Ismail stressed shared interests and beliefs, praising the Ottomans’ commitment to confront the Christian powers and their support for Mecca and Medina [2]. He sought to establish Morocco’s primacy in conducting the jihad in the Maghrib and presented Morocco’s own efforts on behalf of the jihad as an equivalent to those of the Ottoman Sultan [2].\n\nMawlay Ismail's reign also saw successes against European powers. Al-Ma’mūra/al-Mahdiyya (1681) and Larache (1689) were taken by force from Spain, which also evacuated Asila (1692) under pressure, as had also been the case with England’s earlier evacuation of Tangier (1680) [2].\n\n## The Siege of Ceuta\n\nA key element of Mawlay Ismail's foreign policy was the siege of Ceuta, which he considered \"a real jihad\" [2]. He complained about the friendly relations between the Algerians and Spain and accused the Ḥannāsha of having sold grain and other foodstuffs to the Spanish [2]. Mawlay Ismail noted that Ceuta sits in “an indescribably well-fortified and impregnable site,” located on the Strait of Gibraltar and close to the Spanish mainland [2]. In 1700, he explored the possibility of having Great Britain approach Spain for a diplomatic solution over Ceuta [2]. In 1702, Morocco’s ruler reportedly sent an emissary to the Anglo-Dutch fleet, at the time holding the Spanish port of Cadiz, with a proposal for a combined operation to take Ceuta [2].\n\n## Internal Policies and Legacy\n\nMawlay Ismail is known for founding the first black army [5]. The thesis abstract [3] indicates that his reign (1666-1727) is a period of interest for studying forms of political rule and sovereignty in Morocco, considering the intersections of endogenous and exogenous tensions, political accumulation through slavery and piracy, and the impact of imperialism [3]. He also ordered the sealing of the Saadian dynasty tombs in Marrakech at the end of the 17th century as an act of condemnation and suppression of their memory [6]. These tombs remained inaccessible until their rediscovery and opening by French colonizers in the 20th century [6]. Mawlay Ismail's letters to his son demonstrate the historical use of colloquial Arabic in prose writing [1].",
