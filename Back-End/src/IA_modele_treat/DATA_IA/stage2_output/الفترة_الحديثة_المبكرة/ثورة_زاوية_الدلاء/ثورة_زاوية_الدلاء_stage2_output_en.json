  "article_text_raw": "# The Dila'ite Ascent and Fall: A History of the Zawiya of Dila'\n\n## Foundation and Early Influence\n\nThe Zawiya of Dila' was founded around 1566 by ššix Abu Bakr ben Muḥammad El Mejjati Es-Ṣanḥaji (1536-1612) in central Morocco [1]. Initially located near the qṣur of M‘ammar, approximately 10 kilometers southeast of Ayt Isḥaq, a more significant zawiya was later constructed in Ayt Ishaq itself [1]. The Zawiya emerged as both a spiritual and temporal center of a Berber state, representing an attempt at Ṣenḥaja restoration [1]. The Sa'adian rulers initially supported the Zawiya of Dila' [1]. The marabouts of Dila' gained influence through their religious prestige, generosity, and their role in resolving disputes among transhumant Amazigh pastors in the Middle Atlas [1].\n\n## Expansion and Tribal Alliances\n\nThe Zawiya's sphere of influence encompassed the Ayt Idrassen confederation, which included tribes such as the Mejjat, Ayt Nḍir, Ayt Sadden, Ayt ‘Ayyaš, Ayt Yummur, Ayt Wallal, Ayt Wafella, and Imelwan [1]. Initially, the Zawiya focused on Quranic teaching, conflict resolution, and providing hospitality [1]. Its influence extended beyond the Middle Atlas, encompassing the entire Amazigh country, including the High Moulouya and the eastern High Atlas [1]. The Zawiya established links with the qṣar of Tabu‘asamt in Tafilalt to facilitate trade between Saharan people and mountain dwellers [1]. The zawiyas of Sidi Hamza and Sidi Bu Ya‘qub became relays of Dila'ite influence [1]. Around 1630, the Ayt Yafelman alliance was created under Dila'ite influence to counter Semlalite expansionism [1]. Zawit Aḥanṣal was associated with the Dila'ite movement in 1645/46 [1].\n\n## Rise to Power and Conflict\n\nMuḥammad ElḤajj aimed for temporal power, leading to the creation of a solid base and an army [1]. A second zawiya was created on the site of Zawiya des Ayt Ishaq, along with a fortified city [1]. In 1638, Muḥammad ElḤajj confronted and defeated the Sa'adian power near the Oued L‘abid [1]. In 1641, Dila'ite troops occupied Salé, ousting El ‘Ayyaši, and controlled the lucrative commerce of the coastal city for nearly two decades [1]. In 1646, Muḥammad ElḤajj won the battle of Lgara against the Alawites [1]. Following the victory against the Alawites in 1646, the Dilaïtes entered Tafilalt [1]. A pact designated the Jbel El ‘Ayyaši as the border between Dila'ite and Alawite influence zones, with Dila' gaining five strategic fortresses [1]. By 1659, Muḥammad Elḥajj was named sultan in Fes [1].\n\n## Decline and Fall\n\nIn 1661, the province north seceded under Ghailan, and Salé was lost, weakening the Dila'ite power [1]. In 1663, the Dila'ites abandoned Fes as their capital, with Muḥammad ElḤajj ruling from the Zawiya of Dila' [1]. Between 1664 and 1666, the Alawites unified under Mulay Rašid, taking Meknes and Fes [1]. In 1668, Mulay Rašid defeated the Dila'ites at Bothen-Er-Romman and destroyed the Zawiya of Dila' in M'ammar [1]. In 1677, Aḥamad ben ‘Abdallah, grandson of Muḥammad ElḤajj, attempted to revive the Dila'ite cause with Turkish support, but failed [1].",
