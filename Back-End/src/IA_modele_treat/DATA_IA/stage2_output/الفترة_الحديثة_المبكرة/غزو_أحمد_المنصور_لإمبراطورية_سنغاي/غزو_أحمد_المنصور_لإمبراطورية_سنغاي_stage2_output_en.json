  "article_text_raw": "# Ahmad al-Mansur's Conquest of the Songhay Empire\n\n## Background of the Songhay Empire\n\nThe Songhay Empire flourished in West Africa, expanding its territory and trade, developing a strong military and government, and supporting learning and scholarship [1]. It arose from the remains of the Mali Empire under Sonni Ali around 1464 [1]. Gao served as the capital of the Songhay Sultanate [1, 6]. Sonni Ali Ber (1464-1492) and Askia Muhammad (1492-1539) oversaw a period of rapid expansion [6]. Askia Muhammad initiated a golden age of peace and stability [1]. Gao, Timbuktu, and Djenné were important administrative, scholarly, and trade centers [1]. Timbuktu became prominent in the Sudan and known in the Muslim world, producing scholars [1]. The Songhay territory included the Niger bend from Kebbi to Djenné, extending to the Teghâza mines and controlling the gold trade to North Africa [6]. Askia Muhammad I made a pilgrimage to Mecca in 1496-1497 and was declared Caliph of Sudan [10]. He expanded the Songhay Empire to its greatest extent, from Dendi to Sibiridugu and from Teghazza to the border of Yatenga [10]. Askia Dawud (1549-1583) oversaw a period of economic and intellectual flourishing [10].\n\nThe rulers of Songhay were Muslim and maintained close ties with the Islamic world, including pilgrimages to Mecca by Askia Muhammad [6]. Askia Muhammad renewed ties with the Nile Valley and Hejaz after being invested by the Abbasid caliph in Cairo during his pilgrimage to Mecca [8]. However, internal disarray among Askia Muhammad's descendants weakened the Songhay state in the late 16th century [1]. Internal conflicts and rebellions further weakened the empire [10]. Askia Muḥammad IV Bâno's accession in 1586 led to civil war [10]. Al-Saddīḳ, the balama of Timbuktu, revolted against Askia Muḥammad IV in 1588 but was defeated by Isḥāḳ II [10]. Many Songhay princes allied with the Moroccan invaders in 1591 due to dissatisfaction with Gao [10].\n\n## Motivations for the Moroccan Invasion\n\nReligious, political, and economic factors motivated Ahmad al-Mansur's expansion towards the Songhay Empire [3]. The decline of trans-Saharan trade due to the great discoveries and Ottoman expansion in North Africa negatively affected the Moroccan economy [3]. Since the 16th century, the Sharifian dynasty in Morocco attempted to revive the trans-Saharan trade [3]. Sultan Muhammad al-Shaykh al-Mahdî aimed to control the trans-Saharan trade politically and militarily [3]. Control of the salt mines in Taghaza and the gold mines in Ghana was desired to monopolize the trade of salt, gold, and slaves [3]. Seizing the Songhay Empire was considered necessary to dominate the trans-Saharan trade [3]. The Moroccan sultan Mulay Ahmed al-Mansur claimed ownership of the Teghazza salt mines [10]. The salt mines of Teghazza were a source of conflict between the Songhay Empire and the sultans of Morocco [10]. During the reign of Askia Al-Hadj Muḥammad III (1583-1586), a Moroccan expedition occupied the Teghazza mines [10].\n\n## The Moroccan Conquest\n\nIn 1591, Timbuktu was conquered by an army sent by the Moroccan Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur (1578-1603) [4]. The Moroccan invasion of 1591 led to Songhay's capitulation [1]. The Moroccan invasion in 1591 ended the age of the great medieval West African states [1]. The Songhay army in 1591 at the battle of Tondibi numbered approximately 30,000 infantry and 10,000 cavalry [10]. The Moroccan army comprised renegades, Andalusian refugees, and Moroccan soldiers from Dra'a and Fez [4]. The army that conquered the Songhay Sultanate and established a pashalik in Timbuktu in 1591 was largely composed of soldiers from Andalousia and renegades [4]. Andalusian refugees, expelled from Spain between 1492 and 1609, influenced the military power of Morocco through their knowledge of firearms [4]. The expedition of Pasha Djūdar hastened the ruin of trade by ending the largest and most powerful empire in West Sudan by the 16th century [17].\n\n## Aftermath and Consequences\n\nThe conquest of Timbuktu led to the establishment of a pashalik ruled by the descendants of the Moroccan army, known as the Arma, until the 19th century [4]. The Arma established garrisons between Djenné and Gao and made Tombouctou their capital [4]. The Arma integrated into Songhay society through marriage with the politico-religious elite [4]. The Arma developed a unique political system based on unanimous election and possible revocation of the Pasha, with a rotation of the function between divisions of the army from Marrakech and Fès [4]. In the 1710s, Arma factions introduced multi-story buildings in Timbuktu to better defend against gunfire [4]. After the conquest in 1591, most of the Andalusians and renegades returned to Morocco [4]. Between 1591 and 1618, reinforcements primarily came from Arab-Berber populations in southern Morocco [4]. After 1591, the Songhay ruler and his loyalists fled into the Niger valley [4]. Moroccan authorities tried to prevent refugees from the Songhay empire from receiving assistance [4]. The fall of the Songhay Sultanate in 1591 led to waves of refugees fleeing the Moroccan conquest [4]. The Songhay Empire collapsed due to its internal contradictions following civil war and external pressure from Morocco in 1591 [10].\n\nMawlay Amad al-Mansûr finalized the policy of transforming trans-Saharan trade in 1591, benefiting the Maghreb [2]. The Sa'did Empire, after 1591, controlled the Maghreb, the Saharan salt mines, and the Sahel-Sudanese zone with gold and slaves [2]. Moroccan customs posts were established in Touat (1583), Taghâza (1585), Tombouctou, and Djenné [2]. The Dra'-Taghâza-Tombouctou route became a primary trade route between Sa'did Morocco and the Soudan [2]. The route was used by both military convoys and caravans organized by the sultan's men [2]. In 1593, the capture of Timbuktu by al-Manṣūr enabled the transport of 1,200 slaves across the Sahara [17].\n\nThe contact between Muslims in Timbuktu and the Andalusians influenced religious fervor in West Africa between the 17th and 19th centuries [4]. After al-Mansûr's death, trade routes became less secure, leading to disruptions in the salt supply to the Soudan [2]. In 1623, the Moroccan governor of Taghâza fled to Tombouctou [2]. Travelers gradually abandoned the Dra' route, favoring Sous and Tafilalt [2]. The Shorfa 'alawites seized control of the Touat route in 1643 [2]. The loss of Teghazza impacted the Songhay economy and trade routes [10].\n\n## Impact on Ottoman Egypt\n\nThe conquest of Timbuktu by the armies of al-Mansur in 1591 potentially diverted some of the gold flow to Morocco [8]. The wealth acquired by Ahmad al-Mansur from the conquest of the Songhai Empire was to a large extent based on the gold trade that passed through Bilad al-Takrur [7].\n\n## Legacy\n\nThe Moroccan conquest occurred in 1591 [23]. The rulers of Djenné were subject to conflicts between nobles and occupiers [23]. After 1660, Djenné suffered from Peul and Bambara raids, leading to anarchy and famine until the 19th century [23]. The Moroccans left a considerable influence in Djenné, including architecture, well construction, clothing, and food [23]. The article mentions that at the end of the 16th century, Sultan Ahmad Al Mansûr organized an expedition leading to the conquest of Tombouctou and the Songhai Empire [13]. The article explores the disqualification of Subsaharan migrants' Islam based on their perception as 'Blacks' in Moroccan society, linking it to historical slavery [13].",
