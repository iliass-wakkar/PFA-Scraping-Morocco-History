  "article_text_raw": "# Operations Against the Polisario Insurgency in Western Sahara\n\n## Background and Origins of the Conflict\n\nThe conflict in Western Sahara stems from the withdrawal of Spain in 1976 and the subsequent struggle for control of the territory [17, 28]. Spain's abandonment led to a division of the territory between Morocco and Mauritania [17]. This division was opposed by the Polisario Front (Frente Popular de Liberación de Saguía el Hamra y Río de Oro), a Sahrawi liberation movement seeking independence for the region [33, 42]. The Polisario Front, representing the indigenous Sahrawi population, declared the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) in 1976 and initiated a guerilla war against the occupying forces of Morocco and Mauritania [9, 11]. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled on October 16, 1975, that the Sahrawi tribes had the right to self-determination, rejecting Moroccan claims [16, 28].\n\n## The Polisario Front: Formation and Objectives\n\nThe Polisario Front was founded on May 10, 1973, in Zouerate, Mauritania, with the initial aim of ending Spanish colonization [16, 36, 39]. El Ouali Mustapha Sayed, trained by Libyan services, led the organization [6, 36]. The Front's slogan was \"total and unconditional independence\" achieved through \"armed struggle\" [39]. The Polisario Front consisted of Sahrawis, including former soldiers of the Spanish colonial forces [9]. The organization launched its first attack against a Spanish barracks in El Khanga [36].\n\n## Military Operations and Strategies\n\nThe conflict involved various military strategies and operations from both sides. Initially, Morocco focused on defense, controlling key cities and phosphate mines, while the Polisario launched attacks on supply lines [9]. Mauritania, facing internal economic and ethnic tensions, was a weaker target and the focus of initial Polisario attacks, targeting economic targets like iron ore mines to turn the civilian population against the government [9].\n\nMorocco's military strategy evolved over time. General Amed Dlimi reorganized the Moroccan military strategy in 1979, focusing on mobile units and relocating the civilian population [9]. Beginning in 1981, Morocco constructed a defensive wall (Berm) system to isolate the Polisario and secure key areas [9]. This wall system included barbed wire, trenches, fortifications, and extensive minefields [9]. The wall aimed to protect approximately 80% of Western Sahara and included over 300 fortified positions [9]. The construction of the wall significantly hampered Polisario's operations, limiting their ability to establish bases and launch attacks [9]. Despite the wall, Polisario launched attacks against Moroccan forces throughout the 1980s [9].\n\nThe French Air Force also became involved, conducting \"Opération Lamantin\" in Mauritania from December 1977 to July 1978 to support the Mauritanian government against the Polisario Front, which was threatening the Zouérate-Nouadhibou railway [32]. This operation involved strikes against the Polisario Front and limited the group's military activities [32].\n\n## International Involvement and Support\n\nThe conflict drew in various international actors. The Polisario Front received support from Algeria, Libya, Cuba, and North Korea [9, 15]. Algeria's support was crucial in preventing colonial interests, backed by hegemonic powers like France, from dominating the region [13]. Muammar Gaddafi's Libya provided material and military assistance to the Polisario Front [33]. Cuba provided political, military, and medical support to the Polisario Front starting in the 1970s [15].\n\nMorocco received support from the United States, France, and South Africa [9, 39]. The Reagan administration dropped the linkage between US arms sales to Morocco and progress toward a negotiated settlement of the territorial dispute in 1981 [39].\n\n## The Moroccan Wall and its Impact\n\nThe Moroccan Wall, a 1,500-mile barrier of sand and stone guarded by 120,000 soldiers and lined with over one million landmines, was constructed starting in 1983 to combat Polisario terrorism [28]. The wall has been effective in providing security for Moroccans but divides Sahrawi communities and restricts their accessibility and mobility [28]. The wall bisects the territory of Western Sahara [16]. Morocco's 'walls' strategy has relegated the Polisario to very peripheral and disconnected zones [30].\n\n## Ceasefire and Ongoing Conflict\n\nThe UN brokered a ceasefire in 1991, followed by the deployment of UN peacekeepers [9, 16]. The UN Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) scheduled a vote on Sahrawi independence, which was stalled due to Morocco's position on enfranchisement [16, 22]. Despite the ceasefire, the conflict remains unresolved [27]. The six-month MINURSO extension in 2018 increased the likelihood of escalation in the region [14]. In recent months, confrontations have officially resumed due to the Moroccan army's entry into the demilitarized zone because Sahrawi protestors were blocking a road used for trade to sub-Saharan Africa [42].\n\n## Counterinsurgency Tactics and Leadership Targeting\n\nLeadership decapitation was employed as a counterinsurgency tactic. El-Ouali Mustapha Sayed, a leader of the Polisario, was successfully targeted in 1976 [6]. Campaigns are more likely to end quickly when counterinsurgents successfully target enemy leaders [6].\n\n## The Role of Algeria and Regional Tensions\n\nAlgeria has played a significant role in the conflict, supporting the Polisario Front and challenging Morocco's claims to Western Sahara [13, 19]. Morocco has accused Algeria of complicity in providing weapons to the Polisario Front [40]. The conflict between Algeria and Morocco over Western Sahara has effectively stalled the Arab Maghreb Union (AMU) for approximately two decades [27]. A Moroccan attempt to change the status quo in Western Sahara could damage Morocco-Algeria ties [14].\n\n## The Sahrawi Refugee Crisis\n\nThe conflict led to a significant refugee crisis, with Sahrawi refugees fleeing into the desert and settling in refugee camps near Tindouf, Algeria [8, 17, 22]. These camps have been in existence since 1975 [22]. The refugee camps have become the breeding-ground of Sahrawi nationalism and the de facto Sahrawi state-in-exile [22]. The Polisario Front has a goal of developing a national community among the camp population [22].\n\n## Economic Factors and Resource Exploitation\n\nWestern Sahara contains profitable natural resources such as phosphates and fishing [16]. Morocco's government uses Western Sahara's resources in negotiations with international trade partners [16]. The threat from the Polisario Front influences Morocco's arms acquisition programs [35].\n\n## The Use of Drones\n\nMore recently, drones have become a factor in the conflict. In November (year unspecified), Algeria accused Morocco of a drone strike that killed three Algerian workers in a region controlled by the Polisario Front [10]. Morocco publicly acknowledged in 2021 that it was procuring Israeli drones as well as counter-drone capacities [10].\n\n## The Shift to Non-Violent Resistance\n\nWhile the conflict has been characterized by armed struggle, there has also been a shift towards non-violent resistance [20]. Chapter 2 of the book \"Conflict and Insurgency in the Contemporary Middle East\" focuses on \"Western Sahara: nonviolent resistance as a last resort\" [5, 20].",
