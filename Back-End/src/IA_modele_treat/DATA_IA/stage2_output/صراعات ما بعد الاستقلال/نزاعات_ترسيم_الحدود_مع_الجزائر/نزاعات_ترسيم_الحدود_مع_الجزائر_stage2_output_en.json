  "article_text_raw": "# Border Demarcation Conflicts Involving Algeria\n\n## Colonial Origins and Early Disputes\n\nThe issue of border demarcation has been a recurring source of tension and conflict for Algeria, stemming largely from the artificial borders drawn during the colonial era [23, 47]. The Berlin Conference of 1884-1885 saw European powers carve up Africa, creating territories that reflected European compromises rather than African interests, leading to artificial borders that have caused suffering and conflicts in post-colonial Africa [23]. The French colonial administration, which controlled Algeria for 132 years until its independence in 1962, gradually expanded its influence into areas claimed by neighboring Morocco, leading to future disputes [8, 17, 20]. France's actions included the occupation of areas like Gurara, Tuat, and Tidikelt in 1900 and 1901, and the establishment of a \"line of operation\" in 1960 following the Draa River [20].\n\nThe Treaty of Lalla Marnia in 1845, intended to define the border between Morocco and Algeria, only delimited a section from Saidia to Teniet Sassi, leaving the southern territories undefined and setting the stage for future disagreements [45, 108]. The French exploited this ambiguity to expand into the Sahara, a move protested by Morocco [20]. This expansion was further complicated by the discovery of mineral resources in the disputed territories, contributing to Algeria's stance on maintaining the inherited colonial borders [20].\n\n## The Algerian-Moroccan Border Conflict\n\nFollowing Morocco's independence in 1956, the issue of defining borders was raised, with King Mohammed V claiming parts of southern Algeria as Moroccan territory [20]. In 1958, Morocco withdrew from a joint Franco-Moroccan commission working to define borders [20]. In July 1961, Morocco and the Provisional Government of Algeria (GPRA), led by Ferhat Abbas, signed an agreement concerning the border issue, recognizing that it would be resolved through negotiation between the two governments [1, 2, 20]. However, after Algeria's independence in 1962, tensions arose, with military incidents around Tindouf [20]. The Algerian constitution of 1963 affirmed the country's indivisibility, complicating Moroccan territorial claims [20].\n\nThese tensions culminated in the Sand War of 1963, a brief but significant military conflict between Algeria and Morocco [16, 58, 61]. Skirmishes on the Saharan border on October 8, 1963, escalated into troop mobilization following Moroccan territorial claims [58]. The conflict involved the Forces armées royales marocaines (FAR) and the Armée nationale populaire algérienne (ANP) [58]. Algeria appealed to the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) instead of the Arab League during the conflict [40].\n\nMediation efforts by Arab and African countries, particularly the intervention of Ethiopian Emperor Haïlé Selassié at the Bamako conference (October 29-30, 1963), led to a ceasefire agreement on November 2, 1963 [6, 58, 62]. The Bamako Agreement established a commission to determine a zone for troop withdrawal and a special arbitration commission to study the border problem [32, 62]. Despite the ceasefire, fighting persisted in the Figuig region until November 5 [58]. The OAU established an ad hoc commission to mediate the dispute, but it failed to bring about a settlement [27, 43].\n\nIn January 1969, King Hassan II of Morocco and Algerian President Houari Boumediene signed a treaty of cooperation and friendship in Ifrane [20]. However, the issue of Western Sahara continued to strain relations [11, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 54, 63]. In 1975, an agreement was signed by Spain, Morocco, and Mauritania regarding the transfer of power after the Spanish withdrawal from Western Sahara, further complicating the issue [20]. Algeria supported the Polisario Front, which opposed the partition and advocated for self-determination for the Sahrawi people [20, 25].\n\n## The Western Sahara and Continued Tensions\n\nThe conflict in the desert (Western Sahara) became the core of the dispute between Algeria and Morocco [16]. The issue of the Sahara became a geostrategic dispute, with Algeria supporting the principle of self-determination for the Sahrawi people, while Morocco emphasized its territorial integrity [20]. In February 1976, Algerian and Moroccan forces clashed at Amgala, close to the Algerian border [20].\n\nThe borders between Algeria and Morocco have been closed for a total of 45 years: 1963-1969, 1976-1988, and from 1994 to the present [16]. The closure in 1994 followed the Hotel Atlas Asni terrorist attacks in Marrakech, which Morocco linked to groups originating from Algeria [19, 20, 21]. Morocco implemented a visa requirement for Algerians, leading to Algeria closing the borders [19, 20, 21].\n\nDespite diplomatic relations being restored in May 1988 and the borders being opened after a 12-year hiatus, tensions soon returned, culminating in the severance of relations in August 2021 [16]. The Maghreb Union, created in 1989, was negatively impacted by the persistent tension and regional rivalry [16, 21].\n\n## Attempts at Resolution and Ongoing Challenges\n\nIn 1972, King Hassan II of Morocco and Algerian President Houari Boumediene signed a treaty confirming the French demarcation of the border [20, 54]. However, this agreement has not fully resolved the underlying tensions [54]. The Western Sahara conflict remains a major obstacle to rapprochement between Morocco and Algeria [54, 84].\n\nThe United Nations has been involved in attempts to resolve the Western Sahara conflict, including the establishment of MINURSO in 1991 to prepare for and supervise a referendum for self-determination [20]. However, disputes over voter eligibility and other issues have prevented the referendum from taking place [20].\n\nThe closed border between Algeria and Morocco hinders economic and security cooperation and is linked to the unresolved Western Sahara conflict [18]. The current status quo generates instability and dire effects on economic prospects for the whole Maghreb region [18]. The political decline of the Polisario Front and Western Sahara's proximity to Mauritania have created an ungoverned area exploited for arms smuggling [18].\n\n## Border Security and Regional Implications\n\nLibya's weak border control contributes to the smuggling of arms, people, and illicit goods, impacting the Maghreb and Sahel regions [12]. In March and April 2012, Libya signed bipartite agreements with Algeria on common security issues [12]. In August 2013, Libya and Algeria decided to activate a joint commission to address security issues related to cross-border incursions by smugglers and terrorists [12]. Algeria is supporting Libya in developing its army and police, with Libyan police attending training courses in Algeria [12].\n\nThe Ghadames summit in January 2013 saw Libya, Algeria, and Tunisia adopt a coordinated security strategy to enhance security along their common borders [12]. This strategy includes information sharing on trafficking routes, a joint committee, civil society initiatives, and development initiatives in border areas [12].\n\nThe focus of the Algerian army has shifted from the border with Morocco to the country's long desert borders with Tunisia, Libya, Niger, and Mali [11]. Algerian authorities are working to encourage and facilitate trade exchanges across border crossings, especially given Algeria's extensive borders with several African countries [29].\n\n## The Maritime Dimension\n\nIn addition to land borders, Algeria also faces challenges in defining its maritime boundaries [52, 59, 89]. The delimitation of maritime spaces in the Mediterranean is complex due to overlapping claims and the presence of islands [52, 59, 118, 120]. Algeria has a maritime border with Spain, and discussions are ongoing regarding the delimitation of maritime zones [125]. In July 2011, Algeria and Tunisia signed a Convention on the delimitation of their maritime border [103]. Negotiations are planned to delimit the maritime border between Algeria and Morocco [103].\n\n## The Role of the OAU/AU\n\nThe Organization of African Unity (OAU), now the African Union (AU), has played a role in addressing border disputes in Africa [2, 23, 24, 27, 32, 40, 43, 56]. The Algerian-Moroccan border conflict served as the first major test for the OAU's peacekeeping and dispute resolution mechanisms [1]. The OAU's Council of Ministers established an Ad-Hoc Commission to mediate the Algerian-Moroccan dispute, but it was unsuccessful [27]. The OAU's charter aimed to promote unity, solidarity, cooperation, sovereignty, territorial integrity, independence, and the eradication of colonialism in Africa [32]. The OAU charter included a provision (Article 19) for the peaceful settlement of disputes among member states through a commission of mediation, conciliation, and arbitration [32]. The AU's Constitutive Act of 2002 allows for interference in member states' internal affairs in cases of unconstitutional changes of government, human rights abuses, and conflicts threatening regional stability [23].\n\nThe African Union Border Programme (AUBP) aims to complete border demarcation by 2017 [104]. The AUBP emphasizes the importance of clearly defined borders for peace, security, and economic integration on the continent [104].\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe border demarcation conflicts involving Algeria are deeply rooted in colonial history and have been exacerbated by regional political dynamics, particularly the Western Sahara issue. While some progress has been made through bilateral agreements and international mediation, significant challenges remain in fully resolving these disputes and fostering regional cooperation. The ongoing tensions continue to impact security, economic development, and political stability in the Maghreb region.",
