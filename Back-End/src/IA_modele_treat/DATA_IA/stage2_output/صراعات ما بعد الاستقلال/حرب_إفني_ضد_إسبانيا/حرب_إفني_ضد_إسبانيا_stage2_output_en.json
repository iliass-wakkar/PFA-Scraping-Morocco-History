  "article_text_raw": "# The Ifni War: Spain's Last Colonial Conflict in North Africa\n\n## Historical Context: Spanish Presence in Ifni\n\nThe Ifni War, also known as the Forgotten War, took place between 1957 and 1958 in the Spanish territories of Ifni and Sahara in Northwest Africa [3, 6, 12, 17]. Spain's interest in the area dates back to the 15th and 16th centuries with the establishment of Santa Cruz de Mar Pequeña, a Spanish enclave on the African Atlantic coast near the Canary Islands [1]. This enclave was maintained for about 50 years [1]. The reconquest of this territory became an objective for Spanish governments, especially during the second half of the 19th century [1]. Spain's victory in the War of Africa (1859-1860) against Morocco positioned Santa Cruz de Mar Pequeña as a potential war prize [1, 12]. Negotiations between Spanish monarchs and Moroccan sultans eventually led to Spain's establishment in Sidi Ifni in 1934 [1, 16]. A Spanish column occupied the Ait Ba 'Amran territory at Sidi Ifni in April 1934 without resistance [16]. Ifni became a military garrison and administrative headquarters of Spanish West Africa [16]. The effective occupation of Ifni happened in 1934, during the Second Spanish Republic, led by Colonel Osvaldo Capaz [3, 72].\n\n## The Outbreak of War and Francoist Spain\n\nThe Ifni War occurred during the Francoist dictatorship and the decolonization and expansion of Morocco in the mid-20th century [2]. Morocco gained independence in 1956 [3, 15, 39, 45, 50, 84]. The war was Spain's last colonial war in North Africa [3, 12]. The conflict was framed by the Franco regime as an invasion by guerrillas of the 'Army of Liberation' rather than an open war between Morocco and Spain [3]. The Sultan of Morocco, Mohamed V, avoided openly declaring against Spanish interests, placing responsibility on the Armed Bands of Liberation (BAL) [10]. The Armed Bands of Liberation (BAL) were a group that acted as the armed wing of the Istiqlal party [10]. The BAL consisted of individuals who had participated in the independence of Morocco but hadn't integrated into the Royal Armed Forces [10]. The initial BAL mobilization involved attacking the airfield and armory in Sidi Ifni, and other Spanish positions [10]. The attack on Sidi Ifni, the capital of the province, occurred on November 23, 1957 [10].\n\n## Military Operations and Spanish Response\n\nThe Spanish military aviation carried out reconnaissance, combat, transport, rescue, and salvage missions using aircraft like HA 112, Texan T-6, HA211, Junker Ju-52, Douglas C-47, Dornier Do27, E-9, Grumman HU-16, and S55 [6]. The Spanish Air Force executed 2179 sorties, 328 recognitions, 33 aerial supplies, 34 paratrooper launches, 1234 transport services, 40 casualty evacuations, 71 liaisons, and 33 escort and salvage missions [6, 7]. The Air Force transported 6263 men, 976,379 kg of supplies, launched 420 paratroopers, dropped 13,200 kg of material over besieged positions, and evacuated 243 casualties [6, 7]. The Spanish Navy played an important logistical role, including transporting troops and supplies [4, 5]. Naval units were organized into two groups, each consisting of two cruisers and three or four destroyers, supported by a frigate, corvettes, minelayers, and tugboats [4, 5]. Twelve civilian ships were used to transport troops and supplies from the Iberian Peninsula and Canary Islands [4, 5]. The Spanish Navy deployed a Marine Corps contingent to establish a beachhead at El Aaiún [4, 5]. Naval vessels provided artillery support during joint operations with the Spanish Army and Air Force [4]. The first expeditionary company of the Marine Infantry was formed on January 16, 1958, with 222 men, including a medical lieutenant and health personnel, and deployed to El Aaiún [4, 5]. El Aaiún beach was a key point during the campaign and was attacked by insurgent bands on November 25, 1957 [4, 5].\n\n## Casualties and Medical Support\n\nApproximately 300 Spanish soldiers died, over 50 were injured, 80 disappeared, and 40 were taken prisoner during the war [3]. Total casualties in the Ifni War are estimated at around 800, including deaths, injuries, and disappearances [10]. Medical officers of the Armada provided health support on ships and at the Marine Corps detachment on El Aaiún beach [4, 5]. Naval hospitals like San Carlos (Cádiz) and the antituberculosis sanatorium in Madrid treated casualties from the conflict [4, 5]. The medical support system consisted of a stepped approach, starting at the front line, continuing at civilian hospitals in Spanish West Africa, evacuating severe cases to the Military Hospital of Las Palmas, and ultimately to mainland Spain if needed [6, 7]. The Sikorsky S-55 H-19 helicopter was used for the first time in combat for medical evacuations during this conflict [6, 7].\n\n## Media Manipulation and Censorship\n\nThe Franco regime censored the Ifni War, leading to it being largely forgotten in Spain [3, 14]. The Spanish press manipulated information through concealment, propaganda, language manipulation, blaming communism, and historical manipulation [3]. The press did not refer to the conflict as a 'war,' but rather used euphemisms like 'incidents,' 'operations of cleaning,' or 'disturbances' [3]. The Ministry of Information and Tourism enforced censorship based on the 'Serrano Súñer Law' of 1938, dictating press serves the state [3]. The Spanish media emphasized the heroism of Spanish troops and the gradual return to normalcy [10]. Following the Ifni War, there was a tacit agreement among media outlets to bury the dead and their memory [10]. The Spanish authorities tried to blame the Soviet Union and international communism for inciting the incidents during the Ifni War [10, 31].\n\n## International Involvement and Shifting Alliances\n\nThe 'Army of Liberation' was said to be supported by the government of Rabat and the United States [3]. The United States, seeking to maintain its alliance with Morocco, received a visit from the Moroccan sultan shortly before the attack on Ifni [10]. Franco had an 'Africanist' sentiment and there was collaboration between Spain and France regarding anti-insurgent operations [10]. The Plan Madrid, a result of an emergency meeting of the National Defense Board presided by Franco, marked a change in attitude toward Moroccan bands and a closer relationship with France [10]. Spain had to seek French military cooperation during the conflict [28]. The Ifni-Sahara conflict revealed the conditioned and limited nature of US military assistance to Spain [28].\n\n## Aftermath and Territorial Changes\n\nIn April 1958, Spain handed over Tarfaya, the southern zone of the protectorate, to Morocco with the Treaties of Cintra [3, 10]. In 1958, Ifni and the Spanish Sahara became provinces of Spain [3, 13]. Spain maintained sovereignty over Sidi Ifni and the Saharan territory but ceded the majority of Ifni province and Villa Bens to the enemy [4, 5]. In 1969, Spain definitively abandoned the territory of Ifni [3, 10, 12, 15, 39, 45, 52, 72]. It was suspected that the handover of Tarfaya to Morocco was part of a pact that established conditions for the cessation of hostilities during the Ifni War [10]. The handover of Sidi Ifni to Morocco occurred on June 30, 1969 [3].\n\n## Long-Term Consequences and Memory\n\nThe Ifni War is described as an ignored, unknown, and silenced conflict [2, 3, 12, 14]. Following the Ifni War, there was a tacit agreement among media outlets to bury the dead and their memory [10]. The conflict highlighted Madrid's need to diversify its security partners during the Cold War [28]. The Spanish colonial power intensified its development efforts and exerted more control over the Sahrawi population in Western Sahara during this period [8]. The Francoist government distributed subsidies and implemented policies aimed at controlling the Sahrawi way of life in areas such as hygiene, education, and gender relations [8, 17, 18, 29, 44].",
