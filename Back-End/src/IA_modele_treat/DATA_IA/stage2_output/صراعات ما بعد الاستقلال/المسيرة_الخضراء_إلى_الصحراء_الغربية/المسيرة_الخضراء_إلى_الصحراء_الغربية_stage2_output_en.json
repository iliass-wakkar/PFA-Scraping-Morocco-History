  "article_text_raw": "# The Green March to Western Sahara\n\n## Background and Historical Context\n\nThe Green March (المسيرة الخضراء إلى الصحراء الغربية) was a pivotal event in the ongoing dispute over Western Sahara, a territory on the Atlantic coast of North Africa bordering Morocco, Mauritania, and Algeria [2, 28]. The territory, formerly known as Spanish Sahara [46, 28], had been a Spanish colony since 1884 [15, 28]. Spain's colonization began with an expedition led by Emilio Bonelli under the presidency of Antonio Cánovas del Castillo, and a Real Decree in December 1884 proclaimed the territory between Cabo Bojador and Cabo Blanco (Rio de Oro) as a Spanish protectorate [15]. Villa Cisneros (now Dajla) was founded as the first Spanish settlement [15, 28]. In 1963, the United Nations listed Western Sahara as a non-self-governing territory [31, 41]. In 1966, the UN General Assembly urged Spain to organize a referendum on self-determination for Western Sahara [31].\n\nAs Spain prepared to withdraw from Western Sahara, Morocco asserted its claim to the territory [12, 45]. Morocco had long opposed the independence of Mauritania, accusing the French in 1960 of attempting to partition Morocco by creating an artificial state called Mauritania [38]. King Hassan II sought to integrate Western Sahara into Morocco, a move that was seen by some as an expansionist policy [58]. The discovery of a phosphate mine at Bu-Craa in 1964 further intensified geopolitical interest in the region, attracting countries like Morocco, Spain, France, and the United States, who competed for control of the world fertilizer market [19].\n\n## The International Court of Justice and the Green March\n\nIn 1974, Spain committed to holding a referendum in the first half of 1975 [50]. Morocco protested, claiming Western Sahara as an integral part of its territory [50]. The General Assembly requested an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on Morocco's historical claim to Western Sahara in 1974 [50]. On October 16, 1975, the ICJ concluded that pre-colonial ties between Western Sahara and Morocco did not imply sovereignty [31, 38, 50]. The ICJ reaffirmed the right of self-determination applied to all Non-Self-Governing Territories, including Western Sahara [50].\n\nOn the same day as the ICJ's verdict, King Hassan II announced the Green March [45, 58, 63, 91]. The Green March was a strategic maneuver involving approximately 350,000 unarmed Moroccan civilians [5, 15, 45, 48, 63], backed by the Royal Armed Forces [15], who marched into Western Sahara [5, 6, 15, 39, 48, 50, 58, 63, 64, 65, 77, 78, 83, 85, 90, 91, 95, 96, 97, 100, 104, 107, 109, 117, 124, 128, 134, 137, 148, 149, 150, 155, 162]. The purpose of the Green March was to assert Morocco's sovereignty over Western Sahara [5, 45, 48, 63, 85, 90, 99, 100, 109, 117, 124, 128, 134, 137, 148, 149, 150, 155, 162]. King Hassan II presented the Green March as an effort to free the Sahrawis from Spanish colonization [39].\n\nThe UN Security Council, in Resolution 380, called upon Morocco to withdraw from the march immediately [31, 38, 50, 78, 117, 150]. Negotiations between Rabat and Madrid led to the postponement of the Green March [45]. On November 6, 1975, the demonstrators penetrated Western Sahara for a few days [45, 50, 78, 117, 124, 150].\n\n## The Madrid Accords and Subsequent Conflict\n\nOn November 14, 1975, Spain, Morocco, and Mauritania signed the Madrid Accords [15, 39, 41, 45, 50, 58, 63, 78, 85, 95, 104, 106, 117, 124, 137, 148, 149, 150, 155, 161, 166]. The Madrid Accords relinquished Spanish Sahara to Morocco and Mauritania [45, 58, 63, 78, 85, 95, 104, 106, 117, 124, 137, 148, 149, 150, 155, 161, 166]. Spain officially withdrew on February 28, 1976 [15, 45, 50, 63, 78, 85, 95, 104, 106, 117, 124, 137, 148, 149, 150, 155, 161, 166], before Morocco and Mauritania took over on April 14 of the same year [45]. Spain ceded the territory’s administration but did not transfer sovereignty [45]. The UN General Assembly adopted two resolutions on December 10, 1975: resolution 3458A (XXX), requesting Spain to ensure self-determination for the Saharan population and for all parties to desist from unilateral action, and resolution 3458B (XXX), noting the Madrid agreement and asking interim authorities to ensure the Saharans' right to self-determination [14].\n\nFollowing the Spanish withdrawal, the Polisario Front, backed by Algeria [41, 44, 45, 56, 63, 74, 85, 104, 117, 124, 137, 148, 150, 155, 162], established the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) in 1973 and began a military struggle [41, 45, 56, 63, 78, 85, 104, 117, 124, 137, 148, 150, 155, 161, 162]. The Polisario Front intensified its struggles for independence in the Sahrawi cities [63]. The Polisario Front proclaimed independence and established the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic in response to Moroccan and Mauritanian invasion in 1976 [50]. Mauritania signed a peace agreement with the Frente Polisario on August 10, 1979, withdrawing its forces and renouncing territorial claims [50, 78, 104, 148]. Morocco consolidated its annexation by incorporating Western Sahara under Moroccan domestic law [50]. By August 1979, Morocco had annexed the southern part of Western Sahara previously abandoned by Mauritania [27].\n\nBetween 1982 and 1987, Morocco built a series of six walls, consolidating its territorial control over Western Sahara, partitioning the territory with around 70% inside the 'useful' zone [27]. The functional military stalemate created by the 1987 wall led to an internationally monitored referendum on self-determination agreed upon in 1988 and ratified in 1991 [27].\n\n## The United Nations and the Stalled Peace Process\n\nThe United Nations Mission for Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) was established in 1991 to implement and monitor the referendum [27, 33, 39, 48, 49, 52, 56, 61, 78, 85, 104, 117, 124, 137, 148, 150, 155, 162]. However, Morocco has since refused to allow the ballot, leading to a stalemate [27, 33, 39, 48, 49, 52, 56, 61, 78, 85, 104, 117, 124, 137, 148, 150, 155, 162]. A key sticking point in the referendum has been the identification of Sahrawis eligible to vote due to the mixing of Moroccans and Sahrawis as a consequence of the Green March [39].\n\nIn 1997, the Houston Agreement was made for a referendum in 1998 [27]. The Moroccan-drafted 'Baker Plan I' of 2001 and 'Baker Plan II' of 2003 were attempts to find a resolution [27]. The Manhasset Negotiations of 2007-8 failed to find a solution [27]. Morocco has proposed an 'autonomy' proposal for Western Sahara, but there is little faith among the Sahrawi in that autonomy being genuine [27].\n\nThe Western Sahara dossier remains open in the United Nations three decades after the Green March [4]. The Western Sahara is the only decolonization file still open in Africa [4]. The stagnation of the peace process damages the credibility of the United Nations [4].\n\n## Lasting Impacts and Ongoing Conflict\n\nThe Green March and subsequent Moroccan control have had a multifaceted impact on Moroccan society [3]. The US Department of State acknowledges Morocco's claim and administration of Western Sahara [3]. Moroccan law and practice are applied in Western Sahara [3]. The impetus for action in Western Sahara originated from within Moroccan society, not the government [3]. The Green March continues to have a substantial effect on Moroccan society [3]. Commemorative songs, such as ‘Sawt El Hassan,’ are sung about the Green March, and postage stamps are issued to commemorate the Green March [3].\n\nHowever, the territorial dispute over the Western Sahara threatens the stability of North Africa [4]. The dispute obstructs relations between Morocco, Algeria, and Spain [4]. The dispute makes the development of the Union du Maghreb Arabe (UMA) virtually impossible [4]. The political future of the area, including the survival of the Moroccan Monarchy, depends on the resolution of the conflict [4].\n\nThe Moroccan government engaged in an armed conflict in the Western Sahara with the Sahrawi population, led by the Polisario Front, from 1975-1991 [8]. A ceasefire was organized by the United Nations in 1991, but there have been no further decisions regarding the status of the Western Sahara [8]. There have been no developments in relation to a self-determination referendum for the Sahrawi people [8].\n\nThe decolonization of Western Sahara remains incomplete, nearly 42 years after being designated a non-self governing territory by the UN Decolonisation Committee [9]. Following the withdrawal of Spain and the invasion by Morocco in 1975, the Saharawi population became divided, with some living under Moroccan control and others as refugees in neighboring countries and Europe [9]. The United Nations peace process has been stalled, and the referendum has been delayed for 14 years [9].\n\nThe Western Sahara conflict remains unresolved after 42 years of occupation (as of 2017) [1]. The Moroccan occupation of Western Sahara has taken root [1]. Civil society associations have tried to highlight the illegality of the plunder of Saharawi resources [1]. Some companies have withheld investments in Western Sahara as a sign of protest [1]. The exploitation of renewable resources in Western Sahara presents a new challenge [1]. The legal arguments against the depletion of Saharawi resources cannot be directly applied to renewable resources [1]. Corporations have attempted to use the loophole of renewable resources to their advantage [1].\n\nThe Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that Western Sahara is a separate territory requiring the consent of its people under international law and the law of self-determination [7]. The European Council instructed the European Commission (COM) to negotiate an amendment to trade agreements concerning Western Sahara [7]. The amendment aimed to continue trade while adequately involving the people concerned by the agreement [7]. The Netherlands stated that Morocco, as the administering power of Western Sahara, must consider the interests and wishes of the Western Saharan people when applying protocols to maritime areas [7].\n\nAs of 2015, more than 150,000 Sahrawis mark 40 years as refugees in the Western Sahara [24]. Second-generation Sahrawi refugees have no memory of the 1975 Moroccan bombardment [24]. A referendum on independence was promised to the Sahrawis in 1991 but has not been carried out as of 2015 [24].\n\nIn March 2022, the Spanish government under Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez broke with five decades of neutrality on Western Sahara [25]. Pedro Sánchez sent a letter to Moroccan King Mohammed VI supporting Morocco's 2007 autonomy plan for Western Sahara within the Moroccan state [25].\n\nThe conflict has the potential for internationalization, aligning with the East/West confrontation [21]. Several states, including some EU members, have shifted from neutrality to backing the Moroccan position [21]. The shift in support is motivated by economic interests and concerns over regional stability [21]. A solution is crucial for global food security due to Morocco's control over a significant portion of the world's phosphate supply, including the share in the Western Sahara territory [21].\n\nIn 1975, as the Spanish were preparing to leave Western Sahara, Morocco invaded, sparking a war with the Polisario Front [27]. Morocco occupies about 70% of Western Sahara, stationing approximately 140,000 soldiers, primarily along a 1700 km long sand berm protected by landmines [27]. Morocco has refused to allow the referendum and began extensive exploitation of Western Sahara's non-renewable natural resources [27]. The exploitation of resources has highlighted the plight of the Saharawi people living in refugee camps in Algeria and occupied Western Sahara [27]. The Polisario Front is openly canvassing for a return to war due to the stalled referendum and continued exploitation [27].\n\nIn 2014, SADR Foreign Minister Mohammed Salem threatened a return to armed struggle after a pledge by Morocco’s King Mohammad to maintain its presence in Western Sahara ‘until the end of time’ [27].\n\nThe Green March marked the beginning of the oppression of the Sahrawi people by Morocco [15]. Spain ordered the abandonment of the Sahara starting November 10th as \"Operación Golondrina\" [15]. In October 16 1975, the International Court of Justice delivered an advisory opinion stating that there were no ties of territorial sovereignty between Western Sahara and the Kingdom of Morocco [15]. Hassan II announced the Green March in response to the ICJ verdict [15]. The \"Operación Marabunta\" was designed by Spain to impede the occupation of El Aaiún by Morocco during the Green March [15].",
