  "article_text_raw": "# The Sand War: A Border Conflict Between Algeria and Morocco\n\n## Background and Origins\n\nThe Sand War (حرب الرمال), a conflict between Algeria and Morocco, took place in September-October 1963 [16]. The war stemmed from a territorial dispute, specifically in the Béchar and Tindouf border regions [16]. Morocco attempted to reclaim the Tindouf and Béchar areas, claiming they were annexed to French Algeria by France decades earlier [15]. The conflict was influenced by ill-defined borders inherited from the colonial period [4]. Regional problems in North Africa originate from boundary formation during the colonial period [4]. The absence of a precise border, the discovery of mineral resources, and Moroccan irredentism fueled by the Greater Morocco ideology contributed to the conflict [15, 16].\n\nThe Treaty of Lalla Maghnia (March 18, 1845) defined only 165 km of the border between French Algeria and Morocco [15]. Article 4 of the treaty stated that there was no territorial limit to establish in the Sahara, and both sovereigns would exercise their rights over their respective subjects [17]. In the 1890s, France annexed the Touat, Gourara, and Tidikelt, which had been part of the Moroccan Empire for centuries [15]. France integrated Tindouf and Colomb-Bechar into the French departments of Algeria in 1952 [15, 16]. Morocco sought the return of disputed territories after gaining independence in 1956 [16].\n\nAfter Algeria's independence in 1962, it did not recognize Morocco's claims to Greater Morocco, including Béchar and Tindouf [15]. The new FLN government aimed to maintain the existing colonial borders [16]. The discovery of oil and gas in the Sahara in 1961 became a serious issue [17].\n\n## Prelude to War\n\nWeeks of border skirmishes preceded the main conflict [16]. In July 1962, the Moroccan army entered Algeria to occupy the Saf-Saf military base and amassed troops around Colomb-Béchar with the goal of securing the Algerian lead mine in Tindouf [20]. In September 1957, serious incidents occurred between the Moroccan Liberation Army (ALM) and the Algerian Liberation Army (ALN), with over 90 Algerian fighters disarmed [18]. In the week of Algeria's potential civil war in late July 1962, Moroccan forces raised the Sharifian flag on Zegdou and Saf Saf posts in southwestern Algeria [18].\n\n## The War\n\nOn September 25, 1963, Moroccan forces launched a major offensive across the Algerian border [16]. On October 8, 1963, the Algerian cities of Hassi Beide and Tinjoub were attacked [20]. On October 13, 1963, Morocco launched a major offensive towards Tindouf [16]. By October 15, 1963, Morocco launched a new attack 30 km from the border, targeting the Ghamid el Ghozlen region, Hassi Beida, and Tindjoub, mobilizing infantry, air force, and armored units [20].\n\nThe Algerian army in 1963 was recently formed from the Armée de Libération Nationale (ALN) [15]. The Algerian army was unprepared during the Sand War [23]. The Moroccan army was better equipped with Western equipment during the Sand War [15].\n\nAlgeria received support from Cuba and Egypt [16]. Cuban forces, including T-34 tanks and artillery, arrived in Oran on October 22, 1963 [16]. A Cuban-Algerian counter-offensive, named \"Operation Dignidad\", was planned but cancelled on October 29 [16]. The FLN was aided by Cuba and Bulgaria, with Cuba sending an armored unit and several hundred armed forces to the region [20]. Egypt supported Algeria during the conflict [15]. Morocco received support from France [16].\n\n## International Involvement and Ceasefire\n\nOn October 14, 1963, the Arab League announced in Cairo the need for negotiations as soon as possible [20]. By October 19, 1963, Ben Bella sent delegates to the UN in New York [20]. Ethiopia, Ghana, and the Arab League formed a six-member committee to resume diplomatic activity between Morocco and Algeria [20].\n\nThe ceasefire was signed on October 30, after pressure from the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) [16]. On October 29, the Moroccan and Algerian leaders prepared to go to Bamako to negotiate and end their dispute [20]. On October 30, 1963, Ben Bella and Hassan II arrived in Bamako, joined by the Prime Minister of Mali and the ruler of Ethiopia [20]. A ceasefire agreement was reached in Bamako, set to begin on November 2 at 0h00 [20]. The Charte d'Addis Abeba was created, including the decisions from the Bamako conference, setting up a cease-fire, troop withdrawal, demilitarized border zone, and the creation of the Organisation of African Unity (OUA) [20]. The OUA members accepted the inviolability of borders designated during colonialism by European colonizers [20]. An OAU agreement on February 20, 1964, led to the status quo ante bellum, with the borders favoring Algeria [16]. A demilitarized zone was established and monitored by multinational peacekeepers under the OAU [16]. A formal armistice was signed on February 20, 1964 [15].\n\n## Casualties and Aftermath\n\nFrench sources estimated 60 Algerian deaths and 250 wounded; later studies suggested 300 Algerian deaths [16]. Algeria claims that more than 800 Algerian soldiers were killed in the Sand War [14]. Morocco officially reported 39 deaths [15, 16]. About 57 Moroccans and 379 Algerians were taken as prisoners of war [15, 16]. The Sand War contributed to the enduring rivalry between Morocco and Algeria [15]. The conflict fueled animosity between Morocco and Algeria [16].\n\nFinal border demarcation in the Tindouf area occurred between 1969 and 1972 [15]. Morocco officially dropped its claims on Algerian territories in 1972 [16]. In January 1969, Algerian President Houari Boumédiène made a state visit to Morocco and signed a friendship treaty [16].\n\nBoth governments used the conflict to suppress internal opposition [15, 16]. The Sand War influenced Algeria's support for the Polisario Front in the Western Sahara conflict to limit Moroccan expansionism [15, 16]. The conflict led Algeria to support the Polisario Front in the Western Sahara conflict [16].\n\n## Political and Ideological Dimensions\n\nThe fundamental cause of the war was ideological, with the UNFP in Morocco advocating for social reforms and aligning with the pan-Arabism of Nasser, in contrast to Hassan II's pro-Western orientation [17]. Ben Barka condemned the Moroccan border claims as a betrayal of the global liberation movement [17]. During the Sand War, Algeria was supported by the majority of Third World countries, Egypt, Cuba, and the Eastern Bloc, while Morocco was supported by the Western world [17]. The Sand War can be considered an episode of the Cold War [17, 30].\n\nHassan II's motives for initiating the Sand War included resolving open border questions and protecting the Moroccan monarchy and national bourgeoisie against the Algerian revolution [20]. Ben Bella contemplated subverting the Moroccan regime due to internal issues in Algeria and believed Morocco was ripe for revolution, supported by Nasser [19]. Ben Bella accused Morocco of organizing and financing the Kabylie rebellion led by Aït Ahmed and concentrating troops on the border [19].\n\n## Long-Term Consequences\n\nThe border problems remained unresolved, continuing to poison relations between Algeria and Morocco [17]. The borders between Algeria and Morocco have been closed for a total of 45 years (1963-1969, 1976-1988, and from 1994 to the present) [13, 14]. Diplomatic relations between Algeria and Morocco have been severed for approximately 20 years [13, 14]. The Morocco-Algeria border has been closed since 1994 and remains a military zone [5]. Diplomatic relations and direct aerial connections between Algeria and Morocco were suspended in 2021 [6].\n\nThe conflict in the Western Sahara is a major cause of the dispute between Algeria and Morocco and has had long-term consequences since 1975 [14]. Algeria severed diplomatic relations with Morocco in August 2021, citing hostile actions by the kingdom [14]. The Algerian Minister of Foreign Affairs stated that the Sand War and the Western Sahara issue have historically caused tensions between the two countries [14]. Algeria accuses Morocco of spying on it using the Israeli 'Pegasus' application and supporting terrorist movements [14].\n\nThe Sand War influenced Algeria's policy towards the Western Sahara conflict and its support for the Polisario Front [15]. Algeria, under President Boumédiène, supported the Polisario Front [31]. One reason for Algeria's support of Polisario was the humiliation of Algeria by Morocco in the \"War of the Sands\" in 1963 [31].\n\n## US Involvement\n\nDuring the Sand War between Algeria and Morocco in October 1963, the US may have played a role in the negotiated settlement [24]. Despite anti-American sentiment in the Algerian press during the Sand War, it is unlikely the US participated in the conflict on the side of Morocco [24]. Instead, the US likely facilitated a negotiated settlement [24].",
