  "article_text_raw": "# The Western Sahara War Against the Polisario Front\n\n## Historical Background\n\nThe Western Sahara War, also known as the Western Sahara conflict, is a protracted struggle for control of the Western Sahara, a territory in Northwest Africa bordering Morocco, Algeria, Mauritania, and the Atlantic Ocean [30]. The conflict's roots lie in the decolonization era, specifically the withdrawal of Spain from the territory in 1975 [3, 6, 14, 16, 23, 38, 39, 42, 43, 44, 48, 61, 71, 74, 80, 85, 87, 90, 96, 100, 108, 111, 115, 119, 121, 122, 127, 133]. Spain began colonizing the Western Sahara in 1884, a process that wasn't fully completed until 1936, after which the territory became known as Spanish Sahara [6, 38]. In 1975, as Spanish colonial authorities were preparing a referendum on independence, Morocco invaded the territory [16]. Spain transferred its colonial authority to Morocco and Mauritania in 1975, a move the UN largely deemed illegitimate [16].\n\n## Key Players and Their Objectives\n\nThe primary parties involved in the conflict are the Kingdom of Morocco and the Polisario Front (Popular Front for the Liberation of Saguia el Hamra and Rio de Oro) [28, 43, 44, 48, 61, 71, 74, 80, 85, 87, 90, 96, 100, 108, 111, 115, 119, 121, 122, 127, 133]. Morocco claims sovereignty over Western Sahara, viewing the territory as an integral part of the Kingdom [23, 34, 43, 71, 90, 117]. The Polisario Front, formed in 1973, seeks full independence for Western Sahara and represents the aspirations of the Sahrawi people for a national state [1, 3, 6, 16, 23, 37, 44, 48, 61, 71, 74, 80, 85, 87, 90, 96, 100, 108, 111, 115, 119, 121, 122, 127, 133]. Algeria has been a key supporter of the Polisario Front, providing rear bases, arms, training, and diplomatic support [3, 16, 17, 23, 39, 43, 45, 49, 51, 61, 71, 74, 80, 90, 115, 117, 119]. Mauritania was initially involved, occupying part of Western Sahara following the Madrid Accords of November 14, 1975, but withdrew in 1979 [6, 16, 44, 71, 74, 80, 90, 115].\n\n## The War (1975-1991)\n\nFollowing Spain's withdrawal, Morocco and Mauritania militarily invaded Western Sahara before it was formally decolonized [3, 6, 16, 44, 71, 74, 80, 90, 115]. The invasion was opposed by the Sahrawi population organized around the Polisario Front [44]. The Polisario Front, formed in 1973, waged a fifteen-year guerrilla struggle against Mauritania and Morocco [3]. By 1979, the Polisario rebels eliminated Mauritanian forces, leading Morocco to seize control of Western Sahara’s southern region [42]. From 1980 to 1987, Morocco built a system of earthen berms, supplemented with landmines, extending 1,690 miles (2,700 kilometers) from southwest to northeast of Western Sahara, as a military strategy [23, 39, 42, 90]. The 'Berm' is manned by 150,000 soldiers and controls 85% of the territory, while the Polisario controls the remaining 15% [39]. The conflict caused the displacement of 100,000 to 150,000 people and resulted in the death of thousands of fighters [39].\n\n## The Ceasefire and the Stalled Referendum\n\nA UN-sponsored cease-fire in 1991 resulted in Morocco controlling most of Western Sahara [3]. The UN Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) attempted to implement a plan for a plebiscite in the 1990s, but disagreements arose regarding voter eligibility [3, 42, 74, 90, 115]. The UN mission arrived in Western Sahara with the intention of solving the conflict within 12 months, but remains there [16]. The UN Security Council issued a resolution calling for negotiations between the parties without preconditions, aiming for a just, lasting, and mutually acceptable political solution that provides for self-determination for the people of Western Sahara [21]. The UN has regarded the Western Sahara issue as a matter of decolonization and has defined its resolution in terms of self-determination since 1991, following the UN-brokered ceasefire and the deployment of MINURSO [21].\n\n## Political and Diplomatic Deadlock\n\nKing Hassan II of Morocco died in mid-1999, and his son, Mohammed VI, subsequently rejected independence for Western Sahara [3, 16]. Morocco offered autonomy to Western Sahara but refuses to allow an independence option [16]. In 2007, Morocco presented a formal autonomy proposal, which Polisario rejected without an independence vote option [16]. Peter van Walsum, the departing UN envoy, stated that Morocco decided in April 2004 not to accept any referendum with independence as an option [13]. James Baker, former US Secretary of State, proposed a period of autonomy followed by a vote, which Polisario accepted but Morocco vetoed [13]. Christopher Ross has been the U.N. envoy to Western Sahara since 2008 [16]. Morocco has essentially stopped negotiating and attempted to have Christopher Ross dismissed in 2013 [16].\n\n## International Involvement and Shifting Alliances\n\nThe conflict has been influenced by various international actors and their shifting alliances [2, 3, 8, 13, 15, 22, 23, 28, 43, 49, 51, 66, 72, 74, 87, 90, 91, 100, 115, 117, 119, 123, 139, 140, 141]. During the Cold War, Morocco portrayed the conflict as a proxy war between East and West, seeking U.S. support against Polisario [3]. The Reagan administration provided Morocco with arms in the 1980s, helping it regain territory lost in the early years of the war [3]. After 9/11, Morocco attempted to portray Polisario as susceptible to 'Jihadism' to maintain U.S. support [3]. The United States has consistently supported Morocco in the conflict [2]. France is accused of blocking progress by protecting Morocco in the Security Council [13]. Spain and France are involved due to their historical colonial roles [13]. The EU is implicated through a fisheries agreement with Morocco in Saharan waters [13]. In June 2004, the U.S. awarded Morocco a free trade agreement and major non-NATO ally status [3]. Spain has abandoned its long-standing position of neutrality on Western Saharan independence from Morocco [15]. In March 2022, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez sent a letter to the King of Morocco expressing support for the Moroccan autonomy proposal of 2007 as a resolution to the Western Sahara conflict [20]. In December 2020, then-US President Donald Trump recognized Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara, conditional on the normalization of relations between Morocco and Israel [20]. France, the United States, Israel, and Spain are backing Rabat (Morocco) in the Western Sahara dispute [22]. This backing is to the detriment of Algeria, which supports statehood for the Sahrawi people [22].\n\n## Human Rights and Humanitarian Concerns\n\nThe conflict has resulted in significant human rights abuses and humanitarian concerns [1, 3, 13, 18, 39, 42, 45, 51, 61, 74, 90, 115, 117, 128, 132]. Refugee camps housing Sahrawis were established in Tindouf, Algeria, in 1976 [3, 4, 33, 36, 39, 45, 52, 56, 62, 68, 75, 84, 90, 100, 109, 115, 117, 128, 132, 140]. Tens of thousands of Saharawis live in these camps [4]. The Moroccan occupation threatens the Sahrawi nation and potentially leads to a more radical fight from Polisario [18]. MINURSO's mandate is limited to ceasefire monitoring and it does not monitor human rights [13, 39, 74]. Sahrawi human rights activists face harsh sentences and degrading conditions in Moroccan prisons [20].\n\n## Economic Dimensions of the Conflict\n\nThe conflict is intertwined with economic interests, particularly the exploitation of natural resources in Western Sahara [12, 13, 16, 20, 25, 35, 45, 51, 58, 59, 61, 72, 74, 84, 90, 99, 100, 105, 115, 117, 123, 129, 131, 138, 142, 145]. Morocco has exploited Western Saharan phosphates since its forces moved into the territory [13]. In 2002, U.N. legal expert Hans Corel deemed Moroccan efforts to exploit Western Saharan natural resources as illegal [16]. The EU's relationship with Western Sahara, including economic engagement, is ad hoc and influenced by geopolitical and legal factors [12]. The European Commission conducted public consultations in Western Sahara to examine the economic and human rights impacts of proposals [12].\n\n## Renewed Armed Conflict and Future Prospects\n\nArmed clashes resumed after the collapse of the peace process [29]. Polisario argued that international law requires a vote where independence would be an option and said it was under pressure to return to armed conflict [13]. The Polisario Front proclaimed the end of the ceasefire with Morocco on November 13, 2020, after being in effect since September 6, 1991 [83]. Algeria will continue supporting the Western Saharan independence movement's renewed armed attacks against Rabat’s forces in the Sahara [15]. The conflict's drivers are dynamic, with tensions caused by war contributing to its continuation [14]. The article suggests exploring free association between Western Sahara and Morocco as an alternative to independence or integration [29]. A free association agreement would need to be accepted by the Sahrawis in a referendum [29].",
