  "article_text_raw": "# Border Tensions Involving Algeria: A Historical Overview\n\n## Colonial Legacy and Early Conflicts\n\nThe borders inherited from colonization are a primary source of disputes between Algeria and its neighbors [1]. The newly independent nations of the Maghrib inherited political problems, particularly concerning frontiers, from their former imperial ruler, France [5]. French colonial policies were largely responsible for the divisive border issue in North Africa, complicated by varying concepts of statehood and long-standing historical problems [5]. When France conquered Algiers in 1830, they did not initially plan to take all of Algeria, and there was no clear concept of an Algerian state or consciousness [5]. French expansion in North Africa brought the colonialists into direct conflict with Morocco, the Beylik of Tunis, and Algerian dissidents [5].\n\nThe Algerian-Moroccan Border Conflict of October 1963, also known as the Sand War, highlights the explosiveness of frontier issues [5, 19]. This conflict, involving an invasion of Algerian territory by Morocco, was a turning point in the formation of Algeria's security doctrine [19]. The \"Sand War\" in October 1963, which involved an invasion of Algerian territory by Morocco, was a turning point in the formation of Algeria's security doctrine [19].\n\nA territorial dispute also existed between Tunisia and Algeria [5]. The Algerian government disputed claims based on the historic rights of Morocco and Tunisia, claiming ownership of all territories controlled by the French administration of colonial Algeria [5].\n\n## The Western Sahara Dispute and Regional Rivalry\n\nThe question of Western Sahara remains a major point of contention between Algeria and Morocco, with the border between the two countries closed since 1994 due to this dispute [14, 25]. Morocco claims sovereignty over Western Sahara, while Algeria supports the Polisario Front, a Sahrawi independence movement [14, 25, 27]. Algeria backed the Polisario Front's declaration of the 'Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic' in 1976, leading to a 16-year war between Morocco/Mauritania and the Polisario [14]. In 1979, Mauritania withdrew its claim to Western Sahara, and Morocco annexed the southern two-thirds of the territory [14].\n\nThe tension between Algeria and Morocco over the Western Sahara prevents greater regional cooperation [12]. The United States' policy on Western Sahara has shifted over time, from supporting Spain's colonial claims to advocating for a referendum on self-determination, to leaning towards Morocco [14]. The Reagan administration in 1981 adopted a pro-Moroccan policy, backing King Hassan II and increasing military aid to counter Algeria's support for the Polisario [14]. The Trump administration in 2020 explicitly affirmed Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara in exchange for Morocco normalizing ties with Israel [14].\n\nRegional rivalry between Morocco and Algeria contributes to the border tensions [1]. Long-standing political differences between Morocco and Algeria impede agreement on border control [1]. The fortification of the Morocco–Algeria border is an aspect of regional competition and serves as a tool to maintain the existing Maghreb subsystem [1].\n\n## Security Concerns and Border Militarization\n\nSince 2011, none of Algeria's seven land borders is considered stable and secure [2]. Regional conflicts are placing unprecedented pressure on Algeria's borders [2]. The Algerian government has expressed concerns about the vulnerability of its borders, and Algerian security services are determined to assure state security amidst border vulnerability [2].\n\nAlgerian foreign policy since 2011 has been impacted by security threats from neighboring countries, particularly Libya and Mali [3]. The disintegration of Libya and Mali has created a new sub-regional context that challenges Algeria's foreign policy [3]. The deteriorating regional security situation has pushed Algeria to reconsider its principles of non-interference, respect for state sovereignty, and support for anti-colonial movements [3]. Algeria's security concerns are intertwined with its domestic stability and regime security [3].\n\nTo reduce the stresses on security and defense forces patrolling land frontiers, Algeria has built the most elaborate series of fortifications, which cover significant stretches along the country's borders with Morocco, Mali, Niger, Libya, and Tunisia [11]. In 2014, Algeria created militarized zones on its borders transferring border security functions to the MOD [32].\n\n## Cross-Border Smuggling and Irregular Migration\n\nCross-border smuggling between Algeria and Tunisia impacts state formation [10]. Formal elements along the Algeria-Tunisia border include state institutions like border police, customs, and territorial markers such as trenches and checkpoints [10]. Informal elements consist of smuggling kingpins, small-time smugglers, lookouts, and drivers who impact the borderland economy [10]. The state negotiates the operational leeway of the informal players along the Algeria-Tunisia border with local authorities [10].\n\nThe Maghreb has been a key origin and transit point for irregular migration to Europe for decades [11]. Maghrebi governments are ambivalent about irregular migration, viewing it as a means for their populations to access better economic opportunities [11]. Commodity smuggling, the irregular cross-border movement of goods such as petrol, is widespread across the region's borders and is a mainstay of borderland populations' livelihoods [11]. Absent external pressure, Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia address irregular migration as akin to cross-border commodity smuggling and do not view enforcement as a high priority [11]. Maghrebi states tolerate significant cross-border smuggling and irregular migration partly because of the need to ensure political stability in economically marginalized regions [11].\n\nLimitations on Algerian migration have the potential to increase illegal border crossings [7]. The impact of these limitations will be felt particularly by Algerians, who previously held a relatively privileged position in France [7]. Increased illicit border crossings in the Mediterranean are predicted, which will strain law enforcement and rescue operations, potentially resulting in more fatalities [7].\n\n## Terrorism and Regional Instability\n\nTransnational terrorism is the dominant preoccupation of the Moroccan, Algerian, and Tunisian governments and drives border security efforts in the region [11]. Algeria and Tunisia have experienced sporadic large-scale terrorist raids from Libya, and far southern Algeria has witnessed a recent uptick in terrorist cross-border movement to and from Mali [11].\n\nAlgeria takes a strong anti-terrorism stance regarding AQIM and prefers military solutions, differing from other Sahelian countries [12]. Even with the strongest military in the region, Algeria is unable to fully police and secure the remote regions where AQIM has a presence [12].\n\nThe conflict in Mali may spill over into Algeria, prompting Algeria to increase its security presence and surveillance in the south [12]. Algeria is choosing not to take an active role in the Tuareg rebellion and conflict in Mali, raising international concerns [12].\n\nThe chaos in Libya is destabilizing Tunisia, exacerbating tensions in the border region [16]. Since 2014, Libya has been a security challenge for Tunisia due to the fragmented military situation and lack of central authority [16]. The perpetrators of attacks in Tunisia had trained at Islamic State camps in Libya [16].\n\n## Diplomatic Efforts and Regional Influence\n\nAlgeria's diplomacy prioritizes the peaceful settlement of crises through dialogue and reconciliation [4]. The thesis studies Algeria's role in mediating international conflicts between 1975 and 2015 [4]. Key conflicts mentioned are the Iran-Iraq territorial disputes (settled in 1975), the Iran hostage crisis (1981), the Ethiopia-Eritrea border conflict (2000), and the Mali politico-military crisis (2015) [4].\n\nAlgeria is perceived as attempting to act as the main power holder in the region, prioritizing control and influence over regional cooperation [12]. Algeria fears other North African countries making alliances that would threaten its status [12].\n\nPresident Abdelmadjid Tebboune envisions reasserting Algeria’s regional leadership [17]. Algeria perceives increased external interference in North Africa and the Sahel as undermining its influence [17].\n\n## Recent Developments and Future Outlook\n\nTensions between Algeria and Morocco have been rising over the past two years (as of September 2022) [21]. Morocco's assertive foreign policy and unstable political situation are contributing factors to the tensions [21]. Changes in Algeria's foreign policy establishment have led to a more hawkish stance on Western Sahara [21].\n\nThe Israel-Hamas conflict has exacerbated existing tensions related to Western Sahara and military build-ups following Algeria's decision to sever diplomatic relations in 2021 [25]. A maritime shooting in September and explosions in Western Sahara in October 2023 heightened the risk of escalation, though both governments ultimately exercised restraint [25].\n\nMali’s military operations near the border with Algeria are likely to exacerbate tensions between Bamako and Algiers [17]. France’s recognition of Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara could encourage similar actions by other European countries [17].\n\nIn February 2024, Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune announced plans for free trade zones with Niger and Mali, despite existing tensions [45]. In February 2024, Algeria conducted a live ammunition exercise on the border with Mali, simulating the destruction of a \"non-conventional enemy\" [45].\n\nProspects for improved Algerian-Moroccan ties are low as of November 17, 2023 [25]. Algeria will use its energy wealth to build international support against Morocco [25]. Rabat and Algiers will compete for influence and soft power in Africa [25].\n\nGrowing tensions between Mali and Algeria are predicted to increase in 2025 [41].",
