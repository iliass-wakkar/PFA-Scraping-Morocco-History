  "article_text_raw": "# The Construction of Defensive Walls in Western Sahara\n\n## Historical Context and Background\n\nThe construction of defensive walls in Western Sahara, also known as the \"Sand Wall\" or \"Berm,\" is a significant event in the ongoing conflict between Morocco and the Polisario Front [22, 33]. The conflict stems from Spain's withdrawal from the territory in 1975 and the subsequent occupation by Morocco and Mauritania, leading to a struggle for self-determination by the Sahrawi people, represented by the Polisario Front [9, 50, 52, 53]. The Western Sahara was colonized by Spain in 1884 [9, 50]. In 1973, the Polisario Front was founded as one of several factions fighting for independence from Spain [9]. In November 1975, the Moroccan government mobilized 350,000 Moroccans to march into the Spanish Sahara in an event known as the Green March [9, 25]. The Madrid Accords, signed in November 1975, transferred the administration of Western Sahara from Spain to Morocco and Mauritania [52, 53]. This transfer, however, excluded Algeria and the Polisario Front [31]. The Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) was proclaimed by the Polisario Front after Spain's withdrawal in 1976 [5, 31, 50, 53].\n\n## Construction and Purpose of the Walls\n\nFaced with a costly guerrilla war against the Polisario Front, Morocco began constructing a series of defensive walls, or \"berms,\" in August 1980 [3, 33, 64]. Construction was completed in 1987 [33, 17]. The walls were built in six stages [7, 48]. The purpose of these walls was to secure phosphate production, protect the \"useful triangle\" including Al-Ayoun, Smara, and Bou Craa, and seal off the territory from attacks by the Polisario Front [3, 7, 48]. The construction and maintenance of the wall has occupied the bulk of national military effort for the last thirty years [22]. The United States provided intelligence assistance for the building of the defensive wall in the desert [9]. France, the United States, and Saudi Arabia supported the construction of the berm [14].\n\n## Physical Characteristics and Military Deployment\n\nThe defensive wall system is approximately 2,700 km long [14, 33, 48, 55, 56, 69]. It consists of sand and stone walls, barbed wire, minefields, and electronic equipment [7, 22, 48, 51, 56, 68]. The walls are three to four meters high [14]. The gaps along the wall are covered by high fences, multiple layers of barbed wire, electronic surveillance devices, and approximately seven million land mines [22, 48]. Forts are located every three to five miles along the wall, manned by as many as 100,000 Moroccan soldiers [22, 33]. The walls were defended by approximately 160,000 Moroccan troops [7]. The Moroccan army installed surveillance systems along the wall, including alarm systems and radars [33, 48]. The radar systems used include Rasura and AN/PPS-15, capable of detecting movements within a 60 km radius [33]. The external main line of the walls follows the approximate line of the border with Algeria and Mauritania [7].\n\n## Impact and Consequences\n\nThe construction of the defensive walls had a significant impact on the conflict [7, 48, 58]. The walls limited the effectiveness of Polisario raids and allowed the resumption of phosphate production [3, 7]. By building the walls, Morocco was able to consolidate its defenses and react more quickly to Polisario attacks [7]. The walls cut the Western Sahara into two territories: the Moroccan-occupied zone and the POLISARIO-controlled zone [7]. The berm bisects Western Sahara, dividing Sahrawis [14]. The wall separates Saharawis in Moroccan-occupied territory from POLISARIO-liberated areas and refugee camps in Algeria [14]. The construction of the wall led the Sahrawi army to transition from guerrilla warfare to a war of attrition [48]. The wall negatively impacts the social, psychological, political, and economic aspects of Sahrawi life, including family separation, restricted movement, and hindering a referendum of self-determination [48]. The Sahara Occidental has become the zone with the highest density of landmines due to the Moroccan wall's construction [56]. More than 2,500 victims have been registered since 1975 due to the minefields around the Moroccan wall [56].\n\n## International Involvement and Perspectives\n\nThe United States has supported Morocco’s occupation of the Western Sahara throughout the conflict [9]. In 1982 the United States and Morocco signed a joint military agreement, U.S. Green Berets were dispatched to the territory to help train and advise Moroccan forces, and the U.S. began providing intelligence assistance for the building of a defensive wall in the desert [9]. U.S. support for Morocco, and the building of the berm in particular, was fundamental to its success in securing and maintaining control over most of the Western Sahara territory [9]. France also supported Morocco, including its involvement in the Green March and the provision of military aid [49]. The construction of the wall lasted for seven years with the aid of France and the United Kingdom [49]. International bodies do not recognize Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara [48]. The UN's MINURSO mission in Western Sahara is the oldest peacekeeping operation in Africa, established in 1991 [50]. The MINURSO mandate has been prevented from expanding to include the monitoring of human rights due to opposition from Spain and France [69].\n\n## Current Status and Future Prospects\n\nThe conflict in Western Sahara remains unresolved [52, 53]. The Polisario Front controls one-third of the territory east of the wall, where the SADR exercises state powers [5]. The United Nations has repeatedly urged the parties to continue negotiations towards a mutually acceptable political solution providing for self-determination [62]. The construction and maintenance of the wall has occupied the bulk of national military effort for the last thirty years [22]. The Sahrawi perspective is that the wall aims for the extermination of the Sahrawi population, colonization, and usurpation of natural resources [48]. The author, a commander in the Sahrawi People's Liberation Army, asserts that the wall has lost its purpose and will eventually be dismantled [48].",
