  "article_text_raw": "# The Roman Annexation of Mauretania\n\n## Background and Initial Roman Interactions\n\nThe region of North Africa known as Mauretania, inhabited by the Mauri people [52, 54], had a complex relationship with Rome long before its formal annexation. By the mid-2nd century BC, most Mediterranean states were politically tied to Rome, with Mauretania being a notable exception [23]. Initially, Rome's approach to Mauretania mirrored Carthage's, focusing on trade rather than territorial acquisition [34]. The Phoenicians had established trading colonies in North Africa [6], and Carthage had commercial relations with Numidia and Mauretania [83]. The Mauri lived between the Atlantic coast and the Moulouya River, while the Numidians resided between the Mauri and western Carthaginian territory [52].\n\n## The Reign of Juba II and Ptolemy\n\nJuba II ruled the client kingdom of Mauretania from 25 BC to AD 23, upholding Roman interests [16]. He was married to Cleopatra Selene, daughter of Mark Antony and Cleopatra VII, and they established a multicultural environment in Caesarea [16]. Juba II was a noted scholar, explorer, and antiquarian whose writings were referenced by Pliny the Elder and Plutarch [2]. His reign was characterized by military campaigns and conflicts with neighboring tribes [2]. Juba II's son, Ptolemy, succeeded him [19].\n\n## Annexation Under Caligula and Claudius\n\nThe kingdom of Mauretania's independence came to an end in AD 40 when Emperor Gaius (Caligula) invited Ptolemy to Rome and had him executed [5, 19]. This act triggered internal unrest in Mauretania [19]. Caligula almost immediately annexed Mauretania [40]. January 1, 40 AD marked the beginning of the provincial era, which continued until the 7th century [40]. Claudius ordered the annexation of Mauretania [19]. The decision to transfer command of the Legio III Augusta to an imperial legate was part of the strategy for annexing Mauretania [73, 74].\n\nAedemon led an armed resistance until shortly before Caligula's death in January 41 AD [40]. Emperor Claudius sent two expeditions in 42 AD to quell resistance in the Atlas Mountains [40]. Several years of fighting were required to subdue the nomadic tribes and restore order [19]. Generals C. Suetonius Paulenus and Hosidius Geta led Roman forces in Mauretania to suppress the unrest [19]. M. Licinius Crassus Frugi also served in Mauretania in 41 AD [74].\n\n## Division of Mauretania\n\nIn 42 AD, Claudius divided the annexed territories into two Roman provinces: Mauretania Tingitana (centered on Tingi/Tangier) and Mauretania Caesariensis (centered on Caesarea/Cherchell) [5, 40]. Mauretania Tingitana extended from the Atlantic to the Malva river (Moulouya), while Mauretania Caesariensis covered the area between the Malva and the Ampsaga (Oued el-Kebir) [40]. The governors of both provinces were equestrian procurators [40]. The province of Mauretania Tingitana was established in 42 AD [12].\n\n## Roman Administration and Military Presence\n\nThe Roman authority in Mauretania Caesariensis was limited in the early decades after annexation [40]. Augustus established several veteran colonies in Mauretania, mostly along coastlines and near established indigenous settlements [5]. The Roman presence in the Mauretaniae initially served security interests rather than a primary goal of Romanization [5]. The army played a crucial role in the province, with auxiliary units guaranteeing control of the territory [87]. The establishment of a permanent garrison in Mauretania Tingitana was entrusted to equestrian procurators [41].\n\nThe Tabula Banasitana inscription provides evidence of Roman citizenship being granted to tribal leaders of the Zegrenses [9]. The 'colloquium inscriptions' of Volubilis reflect diplomatic negotiations between Roman procurators and the Baquates [9]. The defensive system of Volubilis was designed primarily to protect the city itself [12].\n\n## Later Developments and Challenges\n\nUnder Trajan, efforts were made to control essential interior regions, and a military road was built from east to west from Sétif to Albulae [40]. The Severan dynasty extended the limits of Mauretania Caesariensis toward the south, and a new military road (lanova praetentura) was built between 198 and 203 AD [40].\n\nIntermittent troubles occurred in the Mauretaniae during the second and third centuries AD, often related to territorial disputes, economic pressures, or social unrest [5]. Diplomacy, evidenced by conloguia with tribes like the Baquates, was used alongside military action by Rome [5]. The Zegrenses tribe, despite some granting of Roman citizenship, retained many aspects of their tribal laws and organization [5].\n\nThe article \"Les troubles de Maurétanie\" discusses the recasting of Roman African history and the debates surrounding colonialism and resistance to Roman rule [25]. The article \"Rome et la Maurétanie tingitane : un constat d'échec ?\" considers the success or failure of Roman policy in Mauretania Tingitana, highlighting the conflict between the nomadic lifestyle of the local population and the sedentary life the Romans sought to establish [31].\n\n## The Later Roman Empire and Decline\n\nAround 285 AD, the southern border of Mauretania Tingitana was moved to the Loukkos River, and numerous centers occupied during the Haut-Empire were evacuated [32]. Mauretania Sitifensis was created in 303 AD under Diocletian [40]. Mauretania Tingitana was placed in the diocese of Spain, while Mauretania Caesariensis and Sitifensis were placed in the diocese of Africa [40].\n\nThe article \"La fin du Maroc romain\" examines the decline of Roman rule in Morocco, suggesting the transition from the High to the Late Empire occurred before 297 AD [26]. The article \"From Periphery to Core in Late Antique Mauretania\" focuses on the formation of sub-Roman successor states in Mauretania Caesariensis during the 5th and 6th centuries AD [4].\n\n## Indigenous Resistance and Successor States\n\nThe importance of Moorish tribes (gentes) in both provinces, such as the Baquates, Macénites, Zegrenses (in Tingitana), and the Mazices, Bavares, and Quinquegentiani (in Caesariensis), is noted [40]. Significant insurrections occurred, including in the 140s AD under Antoninus Pius, between 263 and 262 AD, in the 290s, and between 370 and 375 AD (Firmus's revolt) [40].\n\nAfter 455 AD, Moorish princes who seized control of the provinces attempted to preserve the Roman heritage, such as the title \"rex gentium Maurorum et Romanorum\" adopted by King Masuna [40, 77]. The kingdom of Altava and the kingdom of Masuna were key successor states [4].\n\n## Legacy\n\nThe Roman annexation of Mauretania had a lasting impact on the region, shaping its political, social, and cultural landscape for centuries to come. While Roman control eventually waned, the legacy of Roman rule continued to influence the region long after the empire's decline [40].",
