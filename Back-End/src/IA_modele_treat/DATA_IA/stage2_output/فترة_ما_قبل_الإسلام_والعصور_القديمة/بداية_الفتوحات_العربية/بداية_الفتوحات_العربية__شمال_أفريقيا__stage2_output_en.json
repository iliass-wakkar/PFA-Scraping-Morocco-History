  "article_text_raw": "# The Beginning of the Arab Conquests in North Africa\n\n## Background and Context\n\nThe Arab conquests, a significant historical phenomenon, began in the 7th century and led to the formation of a vast empire [8, 45]. This expansion followed the rise of the Prophet Muhammad and the unification of Arabia under Islam [8, 24, 38, 52]. The conquests were not solely religious in nature, although religion played a crucial role [8, 16]. The rise of the Prophet and the existing balance of power between empires influenced the Arab conquests [8]. The traditional date for the death of Prophet Muhammad is 632 CE [14]. Some scholars propose that the conquests began before this date, based on non-Muslim sources [14].\n\nThe early Arab conquests, spanning from 622 A.D. to 656 A.D., involved mobility as a key factor [5]. The camel and horse were crucial for transportation and warfare [5]. The conquests transformed the Old World, incorporating former Roman provinces in North Africa into the new Islamic world [42].\n\n## Initial Expansion and Key Figures\n\nThe Arab conquest of northwest Africa is a major event in North African Studies [12]. The Arab conquest occurred in stages, beginning in the 640s [12, 13]. The decisive capture of Egypt in the early 640s laid the foundations for the Arab conquest of North Africa [42, 61]. In 642 and 643, the conquest of Cyrenaica and Tripolitania took place [42]. ‘Amr ibn al-‘As, before leading the troops that conquered Egypt, had traded in Egypt and Ethiopia before the Hijra (622) [42]. He founded the first mosque in Africa in Fustat in 641 [42]. The Byzantines evacuated Alexandria in 642 [42].\n\nKey leaders in the Arab conquest of al-Maghrib included Muawiya b. Hudayj, Uqbah ibn Nafi, Hassan ibn al-Numan, and Musa ibn Nusayr [18]. The conquest began during the reign of Umar ibn al-Khattab (634-644) [18]. Muawiya b. Hudayj was sent to Ifriqiya in 665 [18]. Uqbah ibn Nafi built the city of Kairouan (al-Qayrawān) in Ifrīqiyā between 670 and 675 [12, 18, 42]. The garrison town of al-Qayrawān, established in 670, became the capital of Arab presence in the west [12, 13].\n\n## Berber Resistance and Islamization\n\nThe Arab conquest of the Maghreb was resumed from Egypt [42]. In 688, Kairouan was retaken, and in 695, Carthage was conquered [42]. Between 695 and 700, the Berbers of the Aurès, led by the Kahina, led a strong resistance to the Arab conquest [42]. The Arab conquest of northwest Africa led to the Islamization and Arabization of the Berber populations [13]. Historians debate the chronology, character, and extent of the Islamization and Arabization processes [13].\n\nThe Berbers of North Africa converted to Islam in large numbers soon after their conquest by the Arabs in the second half of the seventh century [20]. However, there is a lack of reliable evidence regarding the conversion process [20]. The Berbers became protagonists in Islamic history, often as dissident Muslims of the Kharijite persuasion [20]. The Maghrib saw revolts in the 740s involving Berbers and Kharijism [20].\n\n## Expansion into Iberia\n\nMusa ibn Nusayr, Governor of Kairouan, completed the conquest of the Maghreb, opening the door to the conquest of Spain in 711 [42]. In 711, Ṭāriq b. Ziyād crossed the Mediterranean into Iberia with an army predominantly composed of northwest Africans [12, 13]. The Muslims who entered Iberia in 711 were mainly Berbers [11]. Ṭāriq b. Ziyād was a Berber [11]. The event is the 'conquest of Spain', a part of the wider Islamic expansion from the Middle East into North Africa and beyond [10]. The conquest began in 711 with the crossing of the Strait of Gibraltar by a mostly Berber force led by Ṭāriq ibn Ziyād [10]. Mūsā ibn Nuṣayr was the governor of Ifrīqiya (modern-day Tunisia) and played a key role in the conquest [10].\n\n## Administration and Early Society\n\nThe Umayyads (661-750) made the Maghrib a single province (wilāya) [13]. In the west, the Arab elite put in place a system of precedence that guaranteed them preferential treatment [12]. In 739 and 740, rebellions from al-Qayrawān to Tangier seriously threatened Umayyad rule in the region [12, 13]. In al-Andalus, a similar rebellion in 741-2 showed that disunity among Arabs could seriously challenge the status quo [12]. When the ʿAbbāsids and their supporters in the east put an end to Umayyad rule in 750, al-Qayrawān hailed the new rulers [12].\n\nThe Umayyad Caliphate, particularly under Mu'awiya, focused on consolidating power while simultaneously paying attention to the conquests [18]. The study period covers 41 to 91 AH/661 to 710 [18]. All territories of al-Maghrib, except Ceuta, were captured during the Umayyad era [18].\n\nThe Arabs began a process of “Berberization” of northwest Africa, its peoples, and their pasts [12, 13]. Medieval Arabic sources agree that the Arab conquests also involved the enslavement of a great number of northwest Africans [12, 13]. The preferred nisba for slaves from the Maghrib was “al-Barbarī” [12, 13].\n\n## The Conquest of Malta\n\nMalta's transition to Islam occurred in 870 [3, 4]. The period of clear Arab sovereignty in Malta is considered to be from 870 to 1091 [3]. The text analyzes the transition using Byzantine and Arab sources [4]. North African coasts were heavily fortified in the early 9th century [4]. Arab raids on Sicily occurred before 827 [4]. In 827, Euphemios, the Byzantine governor of Sicily, sought help from Ifriqiya [4]. Ziyadat Allah, Emir of Ifriqiya, sent a force of 10,000 and 700 cavalry in 100 keels to Sicily [4]. Malta was taken in 257 AH (870-871) according to Ibn al-Khaldun [4]. The date of definitive capture is recorded in the Chronicle of Cambridge as August 29, 870 [4].\n\n## Linguistic and Cultural Impact\n\nThe Islamic conquest was closely linked to the spread of Arabic [33]. The Berbers' adoption of Islam and their need to learn Arabic for understanding religious teachings were key factors [33]. Arab migrations to the Maghreb facilitated the spread and development of Arabic [33]. Mosques and kuttabs built alongside the conquests played a role [33]. The Islamic conquest of the Maghreb was the beginning of a new Islamic culture that spread with the language of the Quran [33].\n\nArab conquests in North Africa began in 647-648 [39]. The Arab conquests left a lasting impact on the culture of the region (Berberie) [39]. Arabic replaced Berber languages in a large part of the Maghreb [39]. Arabic was also influenced by Berber and Punic languages [39].\n\n## Responses to the Conquests\n\nThe book \"Late Antique Responses to the Arab Conquests\" examines the impact of the Arab conquests on various regions and cultures [6, 7]. It explores the historical context, offering insights into the social, cultural, and political transformations during the early Islamic period and the reactions of different groups and communities to the Arab conquests [7]. The book shows how the Arab conquests changed both the Arabian conquerors and the conquered [6].\n\nMaximus the Confessor's life and works intersected with the events surrounding the Arab conquests, particularly focusing on their impact on the Byzantine Empire and North Africa [23]. Epistle 14, written between 634–640, references the Arab conquests and attributes them to Christian iniquities [23].\n\n## Later Developments\n\nThe Kharijite doctrine made a major entrance into the history of the Maghreb with the revolt of 740-742 against Arab governors [42]. In the mid-8th century, a double movement of decomposition and autonomy affected the westernmost conquests of Islam [42]. In 808, the Idrissids founded Fes [42]. In 909, a Shiite adventurer proclaimed himself Caliph and seized Kairouan [42]. The Fatimid caliphs founded Mahdiyya [42]. In the 11th century, Arab tribes started to migrate westwards [42].",
