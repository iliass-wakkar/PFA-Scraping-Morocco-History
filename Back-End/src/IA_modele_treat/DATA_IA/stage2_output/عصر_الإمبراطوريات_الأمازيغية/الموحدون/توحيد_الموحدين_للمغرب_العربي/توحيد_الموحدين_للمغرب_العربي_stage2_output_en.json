  "article_text_raw": "# The Almohad Unification of the Maghreb\n\n## Background and Origins\n\nThe Almohad movement emerged in the Maghreb during the mid-12th to mid-13th centuries, aiming to unify the region and, more broadly, the entire Muslim West [1]. This unification surpassed the earlier efforts of the Almoravids [1]. The movement stemmed from a \"religious reform\" initiated by Ibn Tumart, who became the Mahdi of the Almohads [1]. The Muwahhidun (unitarians) formed the core support base for the Almohad movement [1]. The Almohads' doctrine emphasized *tawhid* (the affirmation of the oneness of God) and rejected anthropomorphism [1].\n\n## Motivations and Goals\n\nThe Almohads pursued religious, political, and economic objectives [1]. These included controlling trans-Saharan trade routes and integrating economic development poles [1]. The Almohads sought to establish a unified political entity based on their religious ideology [1].\n\n## Ibn Tumart and the Almohad Doctrine\n\nIbn Tumart played a crucial role in shaping the Almohad movement [1]. He authored religious texts in the Amazigh language [3]. The Almohads employed the Berber language in their preaching [1]. Ibn Tumart's narratives are complicated by the hagiographic nature of the sources and contradictions within them [2]. The historical accounts are subject to the influence of the official ideology [2].\n\n## Organization of the Almohad Movement\n\nThe Almohad movement was organized through councils, including the Ten (Ahl al-Djamā˓a), the Fifty (Ahl al-Khamsīn), and the Talaba (propagandists) [1]. These councils played a key role in decision-making and the dissemination of Almohad ideology [1].\n\n## Expansion and Military Campaigns\n\nAfter Ibn Tumart's death, Abd al-Mu'min succeeded him and expanded the Almohad empire [1]. The Almohads faced resistance from various groups, including the Banu Ghaniya [1]. Key battles, such as the Battle of Alarcos (1195) and the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa (1212), significantly impacted the Almohad empire [1, 7].\n\n## The Role of the Amazigh Language\n\nThe Almohads took measures regarding the Amazigh language, including making it a language of communication within the society [3]. Ibn Tumart used the Amazigh language to spread his ideas [3]. The Almohads' measures regarding the Amazigh language were not based on ethnic nationalism, but on the need to facilitate linguistic communication in the society [3].\n\n## Decline and Fragmentation\n\nThe Almohad empire eventually fragmented due to internal conflicts and external pressures [1]. Al-Ma'mun renounced the Mahdist doctrine, leading to further instability [1]. The Banu Marin eventually conquered Marrakech in 1269, marking the end of Almohad rule [1].\n\n## The Almohad Legacy\n\nThe Almohad period saw the development of Andalusian art, integrating elements from the Maghreb [9]. North Africa served as a conduit for Eastern artistic influences [9]. The Almohad unification influenced the development of Andalusian art [9]. The Almohad dynasty's history and impact on the region are significant [7]. The Almohad unification of the Maghreb is a key event in African and Arab history [8].",
