  "article_text_raw": "# The Almohad Conquest of Al-Andalus\n\n## Background of Al-Andalus\n\nAl-Andalus, the term used by Muslims to refer to the Iberian Peninsula, was established following the Muslim conquest in 711 AD [20]. This conquest, led by Arab and Berber troops, brought an end to Visigothic rule in Hispania [20, 24]. The Muslim forces, under the leadership of figures like Tariq ibn Ziyad, gained control over most of the peninsula, with the exception of the mountainous regions in the north and northwest where Christian kingdoms emerged [11, 20, 29]. By the 11th century, the majority of the population in Al-Andalus were Arabic-speaking Muslims [20]. The Christian population diminished through emigration, deportation, and conversion, while Jewish communities generally flourished, although periods of forced conversion did occur [20].\n\nThe Umayyad dynasty, after being overthrown in the Levant, established an independent emirate in Al-Andalus in 756 CE [42, 53]. Cordoba became the capital, first of the Umayyad emirate (756–929) and then of the Umayyad caliphate (929–1031) [20]. During this period, Cordoba became a major center of wealth and culture in Europe, flourishing due to agriculture and trade [20, 40]. However, the Umayyad Caliphate was abolished in 1031, leading to the emergence of smaller Taifa kingdoms [20]. These Taifa kingdoms, ruled by local notables, were militarily weak and forced to pay tribute to the advancing Christian kingdoms [20]. The fall of Toledo to the Christians in 1085 prompted the Taifa kings to seek aid from the Almoravids [20].\n\n## The Almoravid Precedent\n\nThe Almoravids, Berber forces from the Sahara, had conquered the Maghreb and founded Marrakech [20]. They defeated the Christians at the battle of Zallāqa in 1086 and eventually incorporated the Taifa kingdoms into their empire [20]. The Almoravids advocated Mālikī orthodoxy and organized periodical expeditions beyond the Christian frontier [4].\n\n## The Rise of the Almohads and their Ideology\n\nThe Almohad dynasty emerged in North Africa in the mid-12th century, confronting Mālikī doctrines [4]. They prioritized unifying the Muslim West over fighting Christians, although they did conquer Almería and Baeza from Castilian hands and expelled the Normans from the coast of Ifriqiya [4]. The Almohads used the ideology of jihad as an instrument for propaganda and legitimacy [4]. A chapter in \"The Legacy of Muslim Spain\" specifically addresses the Almohad ideology in relation to Al-Andalus and North Africa [8, 19, 23, 27, 45, 51].\n\n## The Almohad Conquest\n\nThe Almohad regime confronted Mālikī doctrines in the mid-twelfth century, but prioritized unifying the Muslim West over fighting Christians [4]. Caliph Abū Yūsuf Ya‘qūb al-Manṣūr (r. 1184-99) promoted an ideology of holy war with determination [4]. The Almohad victory at Alarcos (1195) took place amidst an ideological background propitious to the duty to fight the Christians [4]. Caliph an-Nāṣir called all Muslims to join the jihad in 1211 [4].\n\n## The Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa\n\nThe Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa is considered a turning point in the Christian conquest of al-Andalus [4]. Many fuqahā’ (Muslim law experts) joined military campaigns seeking martyrdom, especially at Las Navas [4]. The Andalusi society was unable to effectively resist the conquering dynamics of Iberian feudal aristocracies and monarchies after the conquest of Toledo (1085) [4].\n\n## Social and Cultural Impact\n\nThe Almoravids and Almohads nurtured specifically Islamic thought and feeling due to their religious outlook [14]. The Almohad regime's rule in Al-Andalus had a significant social impact [19, 23, 27, 51]. The Almohads are characterized as narrow-minded forces that contributed to the end of the culture of tolerance in Al-Andalus [17]. The progressive growth of Christian kingdoms led to the domination of territories occupied by the Muslim Andalusi population [13]. The Andalusi population faced the choice of staying in their homes or emigrating and undergoing forced exile [13]. The memory of the Andalusi refugees is described as a reminder of a lost era of tolerance [13].\n\n## Legacy and Memory\n\nThe Almohad period is part of the broader history of Al-Andalus, which has been subject to various interpretations and myths [22, 34, 47, 54, 63]. In the last two decades, the Spanish press's portrayal of the Muslim world shifted from unsympathetic to enthusiastic [22]. This change is partly due to immigration trends, control over oil resources, and relativism in Western discourses towards the Third World [22]. In Spain, a significant internal element is the mass-media's reinvention of a mythical al-Andalus as a tolerant and pluralistic society [22]. This idealized interpretation of seven centuries of Muslim presence in the Iberian Peninsula is based on ignorance and distorts the historical record [22]. The manipulation of the myth of al-Andalus, regardless of intent, has ideological and political implications [22].",
