  "article_text_raw": "# The Almohad Revolution Against the Almoravids\n\n## Background and Origins\n\nThe Almohad Revolution, or ثورة الموحدين ضد المرابطين, was a significant event in the history of the medieval Maghrib and al-Andalus, marking the end of Almoravid rule and the rise of the Almohad Caliphate [7, 10]. The Almoravids, a Berber dynasty, had unified al-Andalus and parts of North Africa, but faced increasing challenges to their legitimacy [43, 44]. The Almohad movement emerged as a religious reform movement that opposed the Almoravids [19].\n\n## The Rise of the Almohad Movement\n\nIbn Tūmart, the founder of the Almohad movement, initiated religious reforms that challenged the prevailing Malikite orthodoxy [18]. He criticized the Almoravids' interpretations of the Qur'an and their reliance on Maliki scholars [18]. Ibn Tumart introduced a new religious doctrine around 1121, centered on Tawhid (the oneness of God) [19, 45]. He embraced various theological currents and claimed to be the Mahdi [19]. The Almohads aimed to re-establish the link between the Muslim community and the Qur'an and the Prophet's example [4]. They presented themselves as restorers of the original ideals and values of the Prophet's community [23].\n\nIbn Tumart's movement gained traction in the Atlas Mountains, particularly among the Masmuda Berber tribes [18, 54, 57]. Īgīlīz, the birthplace of Ibn Tūmart, became a key location for the Almohad movement and a center of resistance against the Almoravids [53, 58]. The Almohads considered the mosques they encountered in conquered territories to be polluted and in need of purification [14].\n\n## Conflict and Expansion\n\nThe Almohads engaged in military campaigns against the Almoravids, whom they accused of perverting Islam [35]. The Battle of Al-Buhayra in 524 AH/1130 AD was a significant defeat for the Almohads, resulting in the death of several key figures in Ibn Tumart's movement [38]. Ibn Tumart himself died three months later [38]. Despite this setback, the Almohad movement continued under the leadership of Abd al-Mu'min, who succeeded Ibn Tumart [18, 35].\n\nAbd al-Mu'min conquered Marrakesh in 1147, marking a turning point in the conflict [18]. The Almohads sacked the city and slaughtered the garrison [37]. The Almohads then expanded their control throughout North Africa and into al-Andalus [12, 18]. They benefited from Almoravid weakening and the Christian threat [10].\n\n## Almohad Rule in Al-Andalus\n\nThe Almohads entered Al-Andalus at the request of its people before unifying Morocco [12]. They governed the Islamic West and al-Andalus during the 6th/12th and the first half of the 7th/13th centuries [4]. The Almohads aimed to reconnect the Muslim community with the Qur'an and the Prophet's example [4]. They sought to break with the 'Maliki' tradition [4].\n\nThe Almohads implemented a centralized administration and replaced Almoravid provincial governors with their own family members [44]. They established a system of education in Marrakech [44]. The Almohads also constructed mosques, minarets, and fortresses in al-Andalus [44]. They favored religious and legal practices different from the traditional Andalusi Maliki practices [17].\n\nThe Almohads initially focused on internal religious reform and military campaigns against the Almoravids [70]. However, they later shifted their focus to external jihad against the Christian kingdoms in the Iberian Peninsula [70]. Almohad caliphs, particularly Abū Ya‘qūb Yūsuf, actively promoted jihad against Christians [70].\n\n## Impact on Religious Minorities\n\nThe Almohads offered Jews and Christians the choice of conversion to Islam or expulsion [16]. This policy led to forced conversions and emigration of Jewish and Christian communities [1, 6, 16]. The Almohads considered mosques in conquered territories to be polluted and in need of purification [14].\n\n## Military Strategy and Decline\n\nThe Almohads expanded eastward, opening a front with Arab tribes in Ifriqiya and the Banu Ghaniya in the Balearic Islands [12]. However, they did not give sufficient attention to the northern front in Al-Andalus [12]. The Almohads' military strategy showed deficiencies after the defeat at Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212 [12]. This defeat had catastrophic consequences for Al-Andalus and North Africa [11]. Major cities like Cordoba, Valencia, Murcia, Jaen, and Sevilla fell to the Christians [11]. The Almohad state fractured due to internal conflicts and the division of power [12].\n\n## The Legacy of the Almohad Revolution\n\nThe Almohad Revolution brought about significant changes in the political, religious, and cultural landscape of the medieval Maghrib and al-Andalus [4, 10]. The Almohads' emphasis on religious reform, centralized administration, and military expansion left a lasting impact on the region [44]. However, their policies also led to persecution of religious minorities and ultimately contributed to their own decline [1, 16]. The Almohad period saw changes in the world of scholarship in al-Andalus, with an attempt to break with the 'Maliki' tradition [4]. The Almohad revolution can be seen as the culmination of a longer process of intellectual, religious, and political emancipation of the Western Muslim world [27].",
