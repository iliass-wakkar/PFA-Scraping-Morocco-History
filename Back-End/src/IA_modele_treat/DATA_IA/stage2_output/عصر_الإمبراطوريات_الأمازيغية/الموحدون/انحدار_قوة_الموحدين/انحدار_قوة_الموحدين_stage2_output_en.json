  "article_text_raw": "# The Decline of Almohad Power\n\n## Origins and Rise of the Almohad Empire\n\nThe Almohad Empire, or al-Muwahhidūn, was founded in the mid-12th century [1]. The movement originated among the Maṣmūda tribes of the High Atlas Mountains in Morocco [1, 3]. Ibn Tūmart, a Maṣmūda Berber tribesman, was considered the mahdī by the Almohads [3]. He preached the Almohad doctrine from 1117 until his death in 1130 [36]. Ibn Tūmart was born around 1081 in Igli, a village in the Hargha tribe [36]. He traveled to Cordoba in 1106 to study Zahirite doctrine and subsequently to the Mashreq, including Baghdad, where he studied Ash'arite theology under the influence of al-Ghazali [36]. Upon his return to the Maghreb in 1117, he preached against the decadent lifestyles of the urban population and was expelled from Bejaïa for his extremism [36].\n\nʿAbd al-Muʾmin, Ibn Tūmart’s successor, constructed the Almohad empire [1, 3]. He secured his recognition as caliph among Ibn Tumart's followers by around 1133 [9]. By 1159, the Almohads had conquered all of North Africa [25]. In 1162, ‘Abd al-Mu’min converted Cordoba again in the capital of al-Andalus [29]. By 1172, the Almohads controlled al-Andalus, the Maghreb, and much of Ifriqiya [9, 25]. The Almohads promoted the Maṣmūda language, alongside Arabic [1]. They were known for urban architecture, especially minarets, and patronized the arts and sciences [1].\n\n## Almohad Governance and Society\n\nThe Almohads emphasized the concept of Tawhid (the oneness of God) [52, 53, 60]. They saw themselves as a renewed form of early Islam, following the model of the prophet Muhammad [53]. The Almohad rule involved a centralization of power under the Caliph [53]. The Almohad administration employed a bureaucracy and a formalization of legal and administrative procedures [53]. The Almohads used the title of Caliph, which signified their claim to universal authority over the dār al-islām [53]. They emphasized order and used the term \"troupeau\" (ra‘iyya) and the term amr (order) in relation to the Almohad exercise of power [51].\n\nThe Almohads implemented significant reforms in the chancery, administration, legal system, and military [60]. There was a shift in authority away from the Maliki legal scholars and towards the rulers [60]. The Almohads created a specialized class called the ṭalabat, who were trained at a school in Marrakech [60]. They integrated Arab tribes, which may have contributed to the empire's longevity [60]. The Almohads implemented a major monetary reform affecting the shape, inscriptions, and metrology of the coins [21]. They rejected recognition of the Abbasid caliphs in coins and included a reference to the Mahdi [21].\n\nThe Almohads also faced challenges, including revolts and the rise of alternative powers such as the Banū Ghäniya [6]. The Almohads considered a large part of the population 'deviant' or 'criminal' [3]. They refused to grant dhimmi status to non-Muslims, leading many to flee [25]. The Almohads exerted pressure on Jews to convert, and after 1165, Judaism and Christianity officially disappeared from the Maghreb [50].\n\n## Factors Contributing to the Decline\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the decline of Almohad power. The Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212 marked a major turning point [6, 7, 12, 13, 15, 22, 25, 31, 47, 51, 56]. This defeat by Christian forces in Spain definitively broke Almohad military power [31]. The Almohad empire suffered a significant setback at the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa (1212) [44].\n\nInternal tensions between Almohads and Andalusians also played a role [7, 10]. The loss of Majorca in 1229 was linked to these internal tensions [7, 10]. The presence of Almohad refugees in Mallorca contributed to the instability that facilitated the conquest of Mallorca [10]. The Almohad valí (governor) Abu Yahya Muhammad ibn 'Ali ibn Musa in Mallorca also played a role [10].\n\nThe Almohads faced logistical challenges in managing military operations on multiple fronts [37]. The reign of al-Mustanṣir (1214-1224) is mentioned in relation to the decline of Almohad military campaigns [37]. The Almohads' ability to supply their troops was impacted [56].\n\nFrom around 1235, Almohad power started to weaken in Morocco, challenged by the rising Marinid dynasty [38]. Almohad power in Spain declined, partly due to local princes like the Nasrids emerging in Granada in 1232, and eventually to Christian conquests [38]. The fall of major cities like Valencia (1238) and Seville (1248) to the Christians marked the final stages of the Almohad decline [12, 38]. Cordova fell to Christian forces in 1236, and Seville in 1248 [25]. The fall of the Almohad dynasty in Seville marked the end of Islamic rule in Seville and Andalusia [12].\n\nThe Almohads' initial rejection of silk and gold garments also impacted textile production [17]. The decline in the taste for textiles decorated with large medallions began in the second half of the 12th century [17].\n\n## Successor States and Legacy\n\nThe decline of the Almohad empire led to the emergence of four independent kingdoms: one in Spain and three in the Maghreb [44]. The Hafsids were installed in Ifrīqiya after the Almohads prevailed [19]. The Hafsid kingdom was founded by Abu Zakaria Yahya (1229-1249) [41]. The Hafsids claimed to have inherited the throne of Ifrīqiya [11]. The Marinids followed the Almohads in Morocco [13]. The Abdelwadides (in Tlemcen), the Marinids (in southern Morocco), and the Hafsids (in Tunisia) dominated these kingdoms [46].\n\nThe Almohad period (1147-1269) is considered a high point of Maghrebi civilization [6, 44]. Almohad art is described as an outgrowth of Almoravid styles, reaching its peak in the 12th century [44]. Significant Almohad architectural achievements include the Kutubiyya Mosque in Marrakech, the Giralda in Seville, and the Hassan Tower in Rabat [44]. The Almohad system of fortifications, including urban walls and rural castles, remained functional until the Christian conquest [38].",
