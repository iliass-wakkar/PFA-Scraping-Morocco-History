  "article_text_raw": "# The Almoravid Influence and Decline of the Ghana Empire\n\n## Origins and Rise of the Ghana Empire\n\nThe Empire of Ghana, also known as Wagadu, was one of the earliest known political formations in West Africa [1]. Arabic sources began mentioning 'Ghāna,' a ruler and city, in the 9th century due to trans-Saharan trade [1]. The empire was known for its riches in gold and held a preeminent role in the western Sahel [1]. The first mention of the empire of Ghana is found in the works of the astronomer El Fazzari just before 800 A.D. [3]. Arabic writings mention that the Empire of Ghana had existed since the second century A.D. [3]. The empire has been equated with the Soninké people’s legend of Wagadu [1]. David Conrad argues that the Soninké knew the ancient kingdom as Wagadu [3]. The word ‘Ghana’ means ‘king’; the inhabitants of the country were the Sarakole [5]. El Bakri suggests 'Ghana' is a title meaning 'Chief of War' [3]. Some believe the name 'Ghana' is derived from the Arabic adjective 'ghanna', meaning beautiful [3].\n\nArchaeological investigations in southern Mauretania have revealed stone masonry villages occupied by prehistoric cultivators as early as 1000 B.C. [2]. The inhabitants of these villages were likely Negro and very probably Soninke, with a culture developed largely without external influences [2]. Around 600 B.C., Libyco-Berbers from North Africa arrived in the area [2]. The initial effect of Libyco-Berber contact was the collapse of the existing sociopolitical organization [2]. Subsequent adjustment, along with trans-Saharan trade carried out by North Africans, led to the re-emergence of the pre-existing pattern, resulting in the Ghana Empire [2]. The prehistoric complex suggests a powerful chiefdom with characteristics of subsequent West African states [2].\n\nIn its apogee, the capital of the empire of Ghana, Kumbi Saleh, was located between the northern bend of the Niger River in the east and the Headwaters of the Senegal River in the west [3]. Kumbi Saleh was divided into two separate towns: one for negro pagans (El Ghaba) and one for Muslims [3]. Excavations at Koumbi Saleh in Southern Mauritania are considered the most probable site of the medieval Western Sudan capital of the Ghana Empire [5]. Radiocarbon dates suggest that Koumbi Saleh flourished between the sixth and eighteenth centuries c.e. [18].\n\nGhana (Wagadu) was wealthy and powerful due to its gold resources and its strategic location for trade between the Sahara, the Sahel, and the West African forest [10]. Ghanaian kings were renowned for their wealth derived from gold mines [5]. Most of the gold in circulation in the Muslim world came from Ghana in the 8th and 9th centuries [5]. Ancient Ghana thrived through extensive trade in salt, copper, and gold [18]. Al-Fazārī's writings from the early 9th century describe Ghana as 'the land of gold' [18].\n\n## The Almoravid Movement and Initial Interactions\n\nThe Almoravids were a Berber Muslim group aiming to expand influence and promote religious devotion [9]. They were a reformist movement advocating a purified form of Malekism [60]. The Almoravid movement's pressure on Ghana in the 9th century influenced the empire's interactions with Islam [16]. The Almoravids were Sanhaja Berbers, primarily Sufis, who split off from northward expansion [16]. The Almoravids aimed to restore sunna, a strict Muslim orthodoxy, throughout western Islam [19, 31].\n\nConflicts arose between the Almoravids and the Ghana Empire due to the Almoravids' goals [9]. The Almoravids captured key trade centers, including Awdaghust [9]. In 1054, Almoravids, allied with Sanhaja Berbers, seized Awdaghust from Zanata Berbers [9]. By 1055, Abū Bakr ibn ՙUmar captured Awdaghust [9]. The Almoravids destroyed Awdaghost in 1055, allegedly due to its submission to Ghana [20]. The Almoravids sacked the Muslim city of Awdaghast for submitting to the pagan king of Ghana [21].\n\nThe Almoravids initiated Islamization in Ghana territory after capturing Awdaghust [9]. Al-Bakrī, an 11th-century Arab writer, described the city of Ghana as consisting of two towns, one largely Muslim with twelve mosques, and the king's town 6 miles distant [18]. Kings of the Ghana Empire tolerated Muslim merchants and those from Ghana who wished to convert, but there is no evidence the kings themselves converted [11].\n\n## The Almoravid Conquest and its Aftermath\n\nIt is traditionally believed that Almoravids captured Kumbi Saleh in 1076 [9]. The supposed conquest of Ghana by the Almoravids is dated to 1076 or 1102-3 [13]. In 1077, Ghana was taken by Berbers, and a pagan (negro) dynasty was replaced by a Muslim dynasty [5]. The Almoravids warred against the Ghana Empire between 1050 and 1080 [12, 19, 31]. The Ghana Empire collapsed in 1076 due to Almoravid conflicts [12, 19, 31]. The Almoravid sack of Kumbi Saleh occurred in the 11th century [9].\n\nHowever, the notion of a definitive Almoravid conquest is challenged by some historians [4, 13, 29, 30, 40, 43, 44, 47, 48, 49]. The paper \"The Conquest That Never Was: Ghana and the Almoravids, 1076. II. The Local Oral Sources,\" challenges the idea that the Almoravids conquered Ghana [4]. The paper suggests drought played a major role in the disintegration of the Soninke state of Wagadu, which is possibly linked to Ghana [4]. The paper questions the positive identification between the Wagadu of oral tradition and the Ghana of written sources [4].\n\nAlmoravid presence and control of Sijilmasa and Awdaghust effectively controlled Kumbi’s trade policies [9]. Almoravid control of Sijilmasa, Awdaghust, and Kumbi shifted trade away from the Ghana Empire [9]. The economic impact of trade shifts ruined Ghana's political power, leading to its collapse by the 13th century [9]. Almoravid actions resulted in conversions to Islam among the Ghana population, especially Soninke merchants [9]. The Almoravid presence encouraged provinces of Ghana Empire to assert independence, weakening Ghana [9]. Almoravid control of trans-Saharan trade reduced Ghana's profit [9]. Trade shifted to Walata, Timbuktu, and Gao [9]. Ghana no longer served as the southernmost terminus of trans-Saharan trade after the Almoravid presence [9]. Almoravid presence shifted trade westward onto the Niger River and north into the Sahara [9].\n\nAlmoravid control of Kumbi lasted less than two decades [9]. By the early 12th century, Ghana reasserted political independence but did not recover its economic wealth [9]. Almoravid successes weakened Ghana, enabling vassal states to defeat Ghana's military in the 13th century [9]. Without economic wealth, Ghana could not upgrade its military and was later turned into a province by the Susu and Mali states [9]. Abū Bakr ibn ՙUmar, leader of the Almoravids, died in 1087 [9]. By 1086, the Almoravids had effective control over the region [9].\n\nAfter the Almoravid conquest, Ghana became but one of several states: Diafunu, Mema, Susu, and Tekrur [20]. The provinces of Mande (Manding) and Takrur had thrown off Ghana's rule \"as early as the middle of the eleventh century\" [20]. In 1203, Ghana was subjugated and enslaved by the king of Sosso [5]. In 1240, Ghana was destroyed by the king of Mali [5, 16]. Some inhabitants of Ghana fled south to Dia and Djenné, while smaller groups of Sarakole scattered across the Sudan [5].\n\n## Debates and Alternative Perspectives\n\nHistorians debate the nature of the Almoravid conquest of Ghana, with some asserting a major conquest that broke Ghana's vitality [30]. D. Conrad and H. Fisher argue against a significant Almoravid conquest of Ghana, based on written texts and oral traditions [30]. Conrad and Fisher challenge the existence of a corresponding dynastic rupture and deny that Ghana was weakened by the Almoravid interlude [30]. The article considers the identity between the Ghana Empire and Wagadou, and the significance of Koumbi Saleh as its capital [30]. The archaeological record at Koumbi Saleh does not clearly show the Almoravid incursions of the XIe century [38].\n\nThe traditional attribution of the Ghana Empire's (Wagadu) fall to the Almoravids has been challenged by historians such as Abdoulaye Bathily and Oumar Kane [40, 43, 44, 47, 48, 49]. The Ghana Empire was already in decline due to internal wars and climatic conditions before the arrival of the Almoravids [40, 43, 44, 47, 48, 49]. The primary causes of the fall of the Ghana Empire were internal conflicts and deteriorating climatic conditions, not the Almoravids [43, 44, 47, 48, 49]. The theory that the Almoravids Islamized the Wagadu-Ghana has been refuted by historians from the historical school of Dakar, based on the analysis of written and oral sources [40, 44, 48, 49]. Islamization of the Ghana Empire predates the arrival of the Almoravids [40, 43, 44, 47, 48, 49].\n\n## Legacy\n\nBy the mid-14th century, Ghāna's ruler became subordinate to the Empire of Mali [1]. The fall of Koumbi Saleh (Ghana's capital) in 1076 did not stop the gold trade [12, 19, 31]. Takrur and Manding, former vassal kingdoms of Ghana, continued active trade with Berber Arabs after Ghana's collapse [12, 19, 31]. The Almoravid period facilitated the spread of Islam, especially among Soninke merchants [9]. The Almoravid actions significantly changed the socio-political and religious environment of the region [9].",
