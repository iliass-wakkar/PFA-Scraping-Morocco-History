  "article_text_raw": "# The Rise of the Almoravids and the Conquest of Morocco\n\n## Origins and Early Development\n\nThe Almoravids (al-Murabitun), meaning \"monk warriors,\" emerged as a rigorous religious movement among the Sanhaja Berbers in the Sahara [45]. Their origins can be traced to the 11th century, with a focus on legalistic piety and \"holy war\" against perceived moral laxity among Muslims [45]. The Berber groups, Lamtuna, Massufa and Djuddala, converted to Islam superficially and later formed the core of the Almoravid movement [12]. The movement was initiated by Yahyà Ibn Ibrahim in the Sahara desert [42]. Abu Bakr and Yusuf Ibn Tashufin led the Almoravids in military expansion across North Africa [42]. Yusuf Ibn Tasufin organized the Almoravids politically, conquering North Africa from 1055 [45].\n\n## Expansion and Consolidation in Morocco\n\nThe Almoravids violently attacked Awdāghust, citing the need to restore justice and abolish abusive taxes [28]. By the end of the 11th century, the Almoravids eliminated the remnants of Kharijism, Shiism, and Barghawata heresy in the western Maghreb, establishing the dominance of the Maliki school of Sunni Islam [12]. The Almoravid dynasty ruled Morocco from 1055 to 1130 and is credited with the foundation of Marrakech [11]. Marrakech was founded by Yusuf Ibn Tashufin in 1070, drawing inspiration from Sijilmasa [42]. The Almoravid emir Yusuf ibn Tashfin constructed the Qasr al-Hajar in 1070, establishing military architectural norms [33].\n\n## Intervention in Al-Andalus\n\nIn 1085, the Christian conquest of Toledo prompted the Almoravids to cross the Strait of Gibraltar into Al-Andalus [45]. Al-Muctamid, the ruler of Seville, was forced to appeal to the Almoravids, who were in the process of subduing the west of the Maghreb [14]. The Almoravids overthrew Al-Muctamid after he defended Seville in 1091 [14]. The Almoravids gained recognition as the supreme authority in Al-Andalus, establishing an empire from the Ebro River to the southern Sahara [45]. The Almoravid rule was characterized by intolerance towards both lax Muslims and non-Muslims [45]. The Almoravids entered the Iberian Peninsula in 1090 [45]. The Almoravid empire spanned from the Ebro River to the Sahara [45].\n\n## Almoravid Administration and Society\n\nThe Almoravids chose to bear the title, “Commander of Muslims,” instead of “Commander of the Faithful” out of respect for the central political unity in Baghdād in the fifth century of the Hijra [9]. The Almoravids achieved political and religious unification of North Africa and Al-Andalus [33]. The Almoravid walls of Marrakech, constructed in 1126, used tapial (rammed earth) and incorporated access in simple bends for greater security [33]. Almoravid walls in Marrakech and Al-Andalus used a stone base and tapial reinforced with lime [42]. Almoravid walls often featured square towers at regular intervals [42]. Almoravid walls also featured recessed entrances for improved defense [42].\n\n## Decline and Fall\n\nThe Almohad movement, advocating a less formalistic interpretation of Islam, emerged in the Atlas Mountains [45]. The Almohads began challenging Almoravid power in the 1120s under Ibn Tumart and Abd-al-Mumin [45]. The weakening of the Almoravid state due to war with the Almohads, Christian advances in al-Andalus, and internal revolts led to its demise [34]. The Almohads conquered Marrakech in 1147, marking the end of the Almoravid emirate after conquering all of al-Magrib [34]. The Almohads conquered Fez on April 26, 1146, due to the betrayal of al-Yayyani [37]. The Almohads conquered Seville in January 1147 [37].\n\n## Legacy\n\nDespite their opposition, the Almohads shared political, administrative, economic, and artistic aspects with the Almoravids, including architectural foundations [34]. The Almohads created new artistic expression distinct from the Almoravids [34]. The Almohad dynasty restored the emblem of the “Commander of the Faithful,” and its rulers bore the title “Caliph” [9]. The Maliki school of thought was introduced to Mauritania by the Almoravids in the 11th century [26].",
