  "article_text_raw": "# The Battle of Zallaqa: A Clash Between Castile and the Almoravids\n\n## Historical Context\n\nThe Battle of Zallaqa, also known as the Battle of Sagrajas, took place in 1086 in the southwest region of al-Andalus, near the Portuguese border [1, 5]. This battle occurred during a period of significant political upheaval in the Iberian Peninsula, marked by the disintegration of the Umayyad Caliphate into various Taifa kingdoms [4]. The Taifa period, lasting from 1013 to 1069, was characterized by competitive politics among these smaller kingdoms [2]. This fragmentation created a power vacuum that was exploited by the expanding Christian kingdoms to the north, particularly the kingdom of Leon-Castile under Alfonso VI [4]. Alfonso VI's ambition was to unite Iberia under his rule [4]. The capture of Toledo by Alfonso VI in 1085 was a significant event that preceded the Battle of Zallaqa [4, 6].\n\n## The Opposing Forces\n\nThe battle pitted Alfonso VI, King of Castile and Galicia (r. 1077–1109), against al-Mu‘tamid Ibn ‘Abbad, Prince of the emirate of Seville (r. 1061–1091) [1]. Facing increasing pressure from Alfonso VI, al-Mu'tamid Ibn Abbad sought assistance from the Almoravids, a powerful Berber dynasty from North Africa [2, 4, 7]. The Almoravids, led by Yusuf ibn Tashufin, responded to the call and crossed the Strait of Gibraltar into al-Andalus [2].\n\n## The Battle and its Aftermath\n\nThe Battle of Zallaqa resulted in a significant defeat for Alfonso VI [4, 5, 6]. The Almoravid victory checked the advance of the Christian kingdoms and marked a turning point in the Reconquista [4]. Following the battle, Alfonso VI entrusted El Cid with the protection of Valencia [5, 6]. El Cid, who had previously served the Muslim king of Zaragoza, ruled Valencia from 1092 to 1099, defending it against the Almoravids [5]. The Almoravids' intervention had a profound impact on religious tolerance and the treatment of minorities in al-Andalus [4]. The years 1086-1094 were a time of political transition in Muslim Spain [2].\n\n## Historiographical Perspectives\n\nHistorical accounts of the Battle of Zallaqa are found in various sources, including poems composed shortly after the battle and historical accounts from later periods [1]. The study of the Taifa Kings era (1013-1086) and the role of the 'ulama' (Muslim religious and legal scholars) provides further context for understanding the events leading up to the battle [2]. Contemporary historians often view the Andalusi ulama as a homogeneous group, but this view is challenged by dividing them into \"mosque ulama\" and \"palace ulama\" [2]. Most historical sources for the Taifa kings era are narrated from the point of view of a subset of the mosque ulama who opposed the Taifa kings and supported their overthrow [2]. The battle is also examined through the lens of mythos and logos, analyzing how poetic and historical narratives shaped its memory [1].\n\n## El Cid's Role\n\nEl Cid, a key figure in the Reconquista, played a significant role in the events surrounding the Battle of Zallaqa [5, 6]. Although initially in disfavor with Alfonso VI, El Cid later served Muslim rulers and developed a prominent position in the Levante [6]. After the defeat at Zallaqa, Alfonso VI accepted El Cid again as a vassal, entrusting him with the protection of Valencia [6]. El Cid's actions are related to the broader context of the Christian-Muslim conflicts, including the Battle of Zallaqa [5].\n\n## Scholarly Analysis\n\nThe Battle of Zallaqa has been the subject of scholarly analysis, with historians examining its causes, consequences, and representations in historical and literary sources [1, 8]. An article titled \"Novedades sobre la batalla llamada de al-Zallaqa (1086)\" by Lévi-Provençal, E; Gómez, E Ga; and Asín, J Oliver, published in the journal Al-Andalus in 1950, provides further insights into the battle [8]. The battle is also discussed in the context of the book \"L'Espagne et la Sicile musulmanes aux XIe et XIIe siècles\" by Pierre Guichard [7].",
