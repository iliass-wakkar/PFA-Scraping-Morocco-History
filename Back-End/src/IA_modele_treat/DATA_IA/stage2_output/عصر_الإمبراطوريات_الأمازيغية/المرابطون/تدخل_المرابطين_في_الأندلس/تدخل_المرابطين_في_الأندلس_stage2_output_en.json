  "article_text_raw": "# The Almoravid Intervention in Al-Andalus\n\n## Background: Al-Andalus Before the Almoravids\n\nAl-Andalus, the area of the Iberian Peninsula under Muslim rule from 711 to 1492, experienced significant political and social changes in the centuries leading up to the Almoravid intervention [15]. The initial Muslim conquest in 711 led to the establishment of Al-Andalus [3]. The Umayyad dynasty ruled Al-Andalus from 756 CE [3]. Cordoba flourished as a cultural center, excelling in science, philosophy, medicine, astronomy, poetry, and history [36]. However, the Caliphate of Cordoba disintegrated after the death of Al-Mansur's son, Abd al-Malik, in 1008, giving rise to the Taifa states by 1031 [6]. These Taifa rulers lacked the unity to effectively resist the Christian kingdoms in the north [6]. Until the early eleventh century, Christian kingdoms in Spain suffered military defeats from Al-Andalus rulers [6]. Al-Mansur (978-1002) led approximately fifty campaigns against the Christian north, sacking Barcelona in 985 and Santiago de Compostela in 997 [6]. The Taifa period saw the end of a unified judicial policy in Al-Andalus [29]. The political fragmentation and weakness in Al-Andalus created the conditions for the later Almoravid intervention [6].\n\n## The Rise of the Almoravids\n\nThe Almoravids (al-Murabitun) were a Berber dynasty originating from the Western Sahara [67]. They were a group of Muslim hermits or monk-soldiers from the Cenhegíes Berber nomads who embraced a rigorous interpretation of Islam [67].\n\n## The Almoravid Intervention\n\nThe Almoravids arrived in the Iberian Peninsula in 1086 [67]. Al-Mu'tamid Ibn 'Abbad, prince of Seville, considered appealing to Yusuf b. Tashfin, the Almoravid leader, to combat the Christians [36]. Yusuf b. Tashfin defeated the Christians at the Battle of Zallaqa in 1087 [36]. However, Alphonse VI quickly rebuilt his forces [36]. Yusuf b. Tashfin decided to unify Al-Andalus and annex it to his kingdom, deposing the Taifa kings [36]. Yusuf b. Tashfin was supported by fuqaha who criticized the Andalusian princes for their impiety and corruption [36]. The Almoravids managed to politically reunify al-Andalus [29].\n\n## Almoravid Rule and Influence\n\nThe Almoravids' legal practices are examined through the analysis of twelve court cases [13]. Chapter 19 in \"Dispensing Justice in Islam: Qadis and their Judgements\" presents twelve court cases on the application of Penal Law under the Almoravids [12]. The Almoravids made interventions in the judiciary, which sometimes clashed with the interests of legal scholars [29]. The Almoravids managed to politically reunify al-Andalus [29]. The Almoravid rule in the Upper March from 1110-1118, though short, left an imprint in material culture through fortification programs [26]. The Almoravids fortified points like The Zafranales, La Torraza, and Velilla de Ebro Tower to control the territory [26]. During the Almoravid period, 'Almoravids' and 'indigenous Muslims' were considered different social elements [26].\n\nThe Almoravids influenced clothing styles in Al-Andalus, generalizing the use of the turban among soldiers and horsemen of the Taifas [67]. The Almoravids were critical of the scandalous way Andalusians drank wine [67]. The Almoravids allowed the consumption of grape juice (rubb) as a syrup, but not wine itself [67].\n\nThe reception of al-Ghazālī's thought in al-Andalus resulted in negative reactions, including condemnation and public burning of his books [33]. Ibn Ṭumlūs stated that fuqahā' appeared before the Almoravid amīr and claimed al-Ghazālī's books could lead Muslims to lose faith, recommending their burning [33]. The first campaign against al-Ghazali's books took place in 503 AH (1109 CE) during the reign of ‘Alī b. Yūsuf [33].\n\nThe Almoravid integration of Almeria led to the opening of markets in Africa and its rise as the most important port in the western Mediterranean [68]. In the Almoravid period, Ibn al-Fahmi used the tax on buildings (ta‘tib) paid by the people of Almería, to strengthen the city walls [68].\n\n## Legal and Social Aspects\n\nMālikī discourses on arbitration and conciliation in al-Andalus were affected by the Almoravid invasion [29]. Ibn Rushd al-Jadd's career evolved under the Almoravids, who intervened in the judiciary [29]. Camilo Gómez Rivas has stressed the role of mediation as performed by Mālikī qāḍīs and fuqahā’ in the economic and social development of the Islamic West under Almoravid rule [29].\n\nThe Almoravids and Almohads, despite theoretically advocating re-Islamization and austerity, saw an increase in the disassociation between legal theory and social practice regarding tomb ornamentation [56]. During the Almoravid period, two new types of funerary stelae were introduced: the tabular stela with a symbolic arch and the mqābriyya [56]. Almoravid epigraphy saw the use of marble and a more uniform, evolved cúfico script [56]. For the first time in funerary epigraphy, the formula profiláctica deltacawwuḏ was used during the Almoravid period [56].\n\n## Challenges to Almoravid Rule\n\nThe Almoravid presence in Al-Andalus was not without its challenges. In 1126, Christians from Granada, Córdoba, and Seville were deported to Meknes and Fez due to their support for Alfonso I of Aragon's incursion into Al-Andalus [60, 61]. This deportation order was based on a fetwa by Ibn Ward [60, 61].\n\n## The End of the Almoravid Period\n\nThe Almoravid rule in the Upper March lasted from 1110-1150 [45]. Abu l-Ḥasan Ṯābit b. ʿAbd Allāh al‑ʿAwfī, who died in 1120-1121, served as judge and wrote a letter requesting aid from the Almoravid emir Tamīm b. Yūsuf just before the capitulation of Zaragoza on December 3, 1118 [45]. The Almohads succeeded the Almoravids [10]. Ibn Mardanīsh was considered the Almohad empire's 'single, most formidable enemy' [10].\n\n## Legacy\n\nThe Almoravid intervention in Al-Andalus marked a significant turning point in the region's history. While they initially came to the aid of the Taifa kingdoms against the Christian advance, they ultimately consolidated power and imposed their own rule [36]. Their influence extended to various aspects of life, from legal practices and social customs to urban development and artistic expression [12, 56, 68, 67]. The Almoravid period is remembered as a time of both reunification and change, leaving a lasting impact on the cultural and political landscape of Al-Andalus [29, 71].",
