  "article_text_raw": "# The First Barbary War: America's Conflict with Tripoli, 1801-1805\n\n## Background to the Conflict\n\nThe First Barbary War, also known as the Tripolitan War, was a naval conflict fought between the United States and Tripoli (present-day Libya) from 1801 to 1805 [6, 15]. This war marked the first instance of American military power projection across the world [18]. The roots of the conflict lay in the practice of Barbary piracy, where states in North Africa—Morocco, Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli—engaged in attacking merchant vessels in the Mediterranean Sea, seizing their goods, and enslaving their crews [3, 5, 14, 46]. These Barbary pirates, supported by Pashas and Deys, demanded tribute from European and American vessels in exchange for safe passage [3]. European powers, including England and France, often paid annual tribute as a form of 'insurance' [3].\n\nFollowing American independence in 1783, American vessels lost British protection and had to deal with Barbary piracy independently [3]. The U.S. government, lacking funds to pay tribute or build a navy, initially attempted to negotiate treaties with the Barbary states [3, 60]. In 1786, the U.S. government agreed to pay tribute to the Barbary states to stop attacks on American ships [14]. By 1797, the United States had paid out $1.25 million in tribute [14]. The Naval Act of 1794, passed on March 27, established the first US Navy to combat these attacks and demands for money [3, 14]. The USS Constitution was the first naval vessel to complete construction [3].\n\nHowever, this policy of appeasement was not universally supported. Thomas Jefferson, while initially favoring war over paying tribute, later acknowledged the necessity of a navy [60, 67]. By 1799 the U.S. was in arrears of $140,000 to Algiers and some $150,000 to Tripoli [14]. In 1801, the Pasha of Tripoli, Yussif Karamanli, demanded $225,000 in tribute from the United States [3]. Jefferson refused the demand, leading the Pasha of Tripoli to declare war against the United States by chopping down the flagstaff in front of the U.S. Consulate in Tripoli on May 10, 1801 [3, 61, 75].\n\n## The Course of the War\n\nJefferson responded by sending frigates to protect American interests in the Mediterranean Sea, initiating naval engagements against the Barbary pirates [3]. A U.S. naval fleet was sent under the command of Commodore Richard Dale [14]. The Enterprise defeated the Tripolitan vessel Tripoli in the first naval battle [3]. Commodore Edward Preble later led four ships to blockade Tripoli Harbor [3].\n\nOne of the most significant events of the war was the capture of the USS Philadelphia in October 1803 [3, 6, 14]. Captain William Bainbridge of the Philadelphia ran aground on Kaliusa Reef and was captured by Tripolitan forces [6]. The loss of the Philadelphia and its crew was a national embarrassment for the United States [6]. In February 1804, Lieutenant Stephen Decatur Jr. led a daring mission to burn the captured frigate Philadelphia in Tripoli harbor, a pivotal moment in the war [3, 6, 14]. Decatur led 75 volunteers to destroy the Philadelphia in Tripoli harbor [29]. Decatur was awarded a sword by Congress and promoted to Captain at 25, becoming the youngest man in the navy to hold that rank [29].\n\nCommodore Edward Preble's strategy, developed between 1803 and 1804, influenced the Navy's doctrine toward naval war [6]. Preble blockaded Tripoli and bombarded the harbor and city multiple times in August and September of 1804 [29]. On September 4th, the ketch Intrepid, crewed by volunteers including Richard Somers, Lt. Joseph Israel and Midshipman Henry Wadsworth, was sent as a floating bomb into Tripoli harbor but blew up, resulting in all hands lost [29].\n\nWilliam Eaton, appointed Navy agent for the Barbary Regencies in May 1804, devised a plan to install Hamet Karamanli as Pasha of Tripoli [3]. In April 1805, William Eaton led the attack in the Battle of Derna, marking the first battle of American troops on foreign soil and the first time the US flag flew on captured territory overseas [3].\n\n## The Treaty of Peace and Aftermath\n\nThe negotiated peace in June 1805 ended the capture of American ships and demands for tribute, effectively ending the First Barbary War [3]. Peace was signed on June 3, 1805, with Tripoli agreeing to $60,000 for Bainbridge and the 300 crewmen of the Philadelphia [29]. The Senate did not approve the peace treaty until the following year after the war's end [3]. The U.S. negotiated a diplomatic peace treaty with Tripoli in 1805 [6]. The negotiated peace in June 1805 ended the capture of American ships and demands for tribute, effectively ending the First Barbary War [3].\n\nThe First Barbary War contributed significantly to the development of a uniquely American republican naval doctrine, characterized by a limited but effective navy, humane leadership, and aggressive tactics [6]. The war also contributed to the permanence of the Navy within the American government [6].\n\nHowever, the peace was short-lived. Hadji Ali, the Dey of Algiers from 1809–1815, declared war on the United States during the War of 1812 at British instigation [3]. This led to the Second Barbary War in 1815 [3, 11].\n\n## Key Figures\n\nSeveral key figures played crucial roles in the First Barbary War. Thomas Jefferson's refusal to pay tribute and his decision to use military force were pivotal in initiating the conflict [3, 7]. Commodore Edward Preble's leadership and aggressive strategy were instrumental in shaping the U.S. Navy's approach to naval warfare [6]. Lieutenant Stephen Decatur Jr.'s daring raid to destroy the USS Philadelphia made him a national hero [3, 6, 14]. William Eaton's campaign to capture Derna with Hamet Karamanli was a significant land-based operation [3].\n\n## Impact and Legacy\n\nThe First Barbary War had a lasting impact on the United States. It demonstrated the need for a strong navy to protect American commerce and citizens abroad [6, 18]. The war also contributed to the development of American national identity and the emergence of naval heroes [6, 18]. The Barbary Wars helped fashion a true national identity [18]. The conflict also marked the beginning of a long and ongoing U.S. military presence in the Middle East [1]. The Barbary Wars increased the American public's interest in the greater Islamic world [1].\n\nThe Barbary Wars also influenced the diplomatic and military strategies of the early United States [11]. The war helped the US engage in global diplomatic endeavors and become a stronger nation [11]. The Barbary Wars ended when the dispute came to a diplomatic resolution that let the United States trade freely overseas [16].\n\nIn the years following the First Barbary War, the United States continued to grapple with the issue of Barbary piracy, eventually leading to the Second Barbary War in 1815 [3, 11]. The Barbary Wars are viewed as evidence of long-standing hostility between Christians and Muslims [13]. Some commentators have suggested that the Barbary powers were 'holy warriors' or 'terrorists' fighting a jihad against the United States [25]. However, some historians dispute these interpretations as Islamophobic [26].",
