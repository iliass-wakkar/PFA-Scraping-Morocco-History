  "article_text_raw": "# The Sieges of Mazagan: A History of Conflict and Transformation\n\n## Origins and Fortification of Mazagan\n\nMazagan, now known as El Jadida, was founded by King Emmanuel of Portugal in 1514 [12]. The toponym 'Mazagan' is possibly of Berber origin, with forms such as 'Mazighan' appearing in texts from the 11th and 12th centuries [12, 15]. Duarte Pacheco Pereira described Mazagan around the beginning of the 16th century, noting the location of a destroyed city [12]. In the summer of 1514, construction of the castle of Mazagan accelerated under Portuguese military protection [12]. Some strategists questioned the need for a fortress at Mazagan given the fortress being built at Azamor [12]. Mazagan began as a small protectorate of the Portuguese crown in 1486 [2]. After the conquest of Azamor in 1513, King Manuel I ordered the transformation of Mazagan into a bastioned fortress to protect the Carreira da Índia [2]. In 1541, Mazagan was transformed into a grand fortress city, considered the first 'ideal city' of the Renaissance built outside of Europe [15].\n\nAround 1540, the building of the bastioned fortress of Mazagan in North Africa marked a turning point in Portuguese fortification [7]. The hiring of an Italian engineer played a major role in the construction of the Mazagan fortress [7]. The experimental process and knowledge transfer involved in the construction of Mazagan went beyond a simple technical delivery from the center to the periphery [7]. In 1541, Benedetto da Ravenna inspected Portuguese cities in Morocco, including Septa, Tangier, and Mazagan [1]. Benedetto da Ravenna's plan for Mazagan is considered the first perfect European bulwarked fortification [1]. In 1541, Benedetto da Ravenna and Miguel de Arruda visited Mazagão to modernise the fortifications [8]. Francisco de Holanda drew the initial model for the fortifications at Mazagão applying the bastion system, though he never visited Mazagão himself [8]. The construction of angled bastions in Mazagão started in 1541, potentially impacting discussions on fort design [8].\n\nAdministrative records related to Mazagan from 1541 reveal the difficulty in obtaining good lime for the new ramparts, with lime being considered more reliable than earth filling [5]. The cistern in Mazagan was built between 1541 and 1547 [2]. The fortress in Mazagão resisted local armies until 1769, at which point it was abandoned due to a long siege and the inability to maintain a garrison [25].\n\n## Sieges and Conflicts\n\nAttacks and sieges on the fortress of Mazagan were frequent throughout its history [12]. Attacks occurred in 1517, and in 1521, Portugues and Moors perished under the walls [12]. In 1525, the King of Fez laid siege to Mazagan [12]. In March 1561, there was a battle after the son of the Sharif demanded the keys to the fortress [12]. In 1562, Agostinho de Gavy de Mendonça's book \"Historia do famoso cerco...\" describes a siege of Mazagan [2]. In 1562, during the defense of Mazagan by Mulay Abdallah's forces, the poem 'De bello Mazagonico' was created, portraying Saadi rulers negatively [9]. Antonio Lopes' poem 'De bello Mazagonico' drew inspiration from Aeschylus' 'The Persians' in its depiction of Muslim rulers [9].\n\nIn 1578, following the Battle of the Three Kings, Moulay esh-Sheykh, a son of the defeated sultan of Morocco, sought refuge in Mazagan, which was then held by the Portuguese [19]. From Mazagan, Moulay esh-Sheykh traveled to Lisbon at the end of December 1578 under the protection of the Portuguese [19].\n\nIn 1623, over 10,000 Moors attacked Mazagan [12]. Gonçalo Coutinho, governor of Mazagan from 1624 to 1627, left detailed descriptions of the ribat of Tit [23]. In 1640, the Captain and over 100 Portuguese cavalry died in combat [12].\n\nTwo documents titled \"Noticia da grande batalha...\" (1757) and \"Noticia do grande assalto e batalha...\" (1756) report on battles and assaults on Mazagan in February 1757 and June 1756 respectively [2]. In 1768, a Moroccan army of 75,000 soldiers besieged Mazagan [12]. In December 1768, the King of Morocco declared Jihad against Mazagan [15]. The Moroccan army, consisting of 120,000 men supported by French military engineers, besieged Mazagan [15]. The Governor of Mazagan prevented the Portuguese from leaving the fortress to defend themselves [15]. On January 30, Moulay Mohammed sent messengers to demand the keys of the city to avoid war [15].\n\n## The Abandonment of Mazagan\n\nMazagan was the last Portuguese city in the Maghreb, abandoned in 1769 [2]. Mazagan was the only Portuguese establishment remaining on the Atlantic coast of Morocco [15]. The abandonment of Mazagan was decided in January 1769 by the Marquis de Pombal and the King of Portugal [15]. On March 11, 1769, the Portuguese evacuated Mazagan [12]. On March 11, 1769, the entire population of Mazagan was forced to abandon the city and return to Lisbon [15]. On March 1, 1769, a fleet of 14 ships arrived from Lisbon with instructions for the abandonment of the city [15]. The fleet had departed from Lisbon on February 3, 1769 [15]. A truce was established with the besieging forces on March 9, 1769 [15]. The population of Mazagan was told that the abandonment was for their own safety from the 'barbarity of the Moors' [15].\n\nThe population of Mazagan at the time of evacuation was approximately 2100 people, under the governance of Dinis Gregorio de Melo e Castro Mendonça [12]. Approximately 2,100 people, comprising 460 families, 31 single soldiers, and 4 priests, sailed for Lisbon [15]. Women, children, invalids, and the sick were evacuated first [15]. Sacred images, silverware, and church ornaments were prioritized during the evacuation [15]. Carriages were burned, iron cannons were thrown into the sea, and walls and buildings were exploded to leave only ruins [15]. On March 8, 1769, embarkation occurred through the 'Porte de la Mer' [15]. The Portuguese destroyed a bastion in Mazagan as they withdrew, killing hundreds of Muslim soldiers [9]. In 1769, there were approximately 200 horses in Mazagan [15]. The city's fortifications had walls that were twelve meters wide [15]. In 1769, Mazagan had five churches, eight small chapels, and fifteen priests [15]. Colonel Carlos Julião, a military officer who participated in the 1769 mission, recalled being part of the expedition against the 'contagious society' of Mazagan [15].\n\nThe 2100 evacuees were intended to help populate the Amazon [12]. The abandonment of Mazagan was part of a larger plan by Pombal to secure Portuguese interests in the Amazon, seeing the city as a drain on resources [15]. The Portuguese community of Mazagan was deported to the Amazon [12]. On March 11, 1769, the Portuguese community left Mazagan on 12 ships for Lisbon under the order of King Joseph and the Marquis of Pombal [12]. In 1769, 371 families (2000 people) embarked from Lisbon to Para on nine ships on September 15 [12]. They arrived in Belém do Para in early January 1770 [12]. From 1772, the inhabitants of Mazagan were gradually transferred to Nova Mazagão [12]. The Mazagan population was relocated to Vila Nova de Mazagão in the Amazon region of Brazil in 1771 after a delay and poor treatment in Lisbon [15]. In 1775, five years after their arrival to Brazil, there were still 68 Mazagan families awaiting relocation in Belém [15]. The new city of Mazagão in Brazil was designed by Domingo Sambuceti and officially founded in 1771 [15].\n\n## Transformation and Legacy\n\nSultan Muhammad III renamed Mazagan to El-Mahduma ('destroyed') after the Portuguese withdrawal and destruction [9, 15]. Mazagan became El-Mahduma ('The Destroyed') and remained empty for 50 years [15]. Later Moroccan rulers worked to rebuild Mazagan, eventually renaming it El-Jadida ('new' or 'renewed') [9]. Around 1820, Jewish merchants requested permission to settle there, and the city was rebuilt and renamed El Jadida ('The New') [15]. In 1821, the city was renamed El Jadida (the New) [25]. In 1822, Alawite rulers commissioned the rebuilding of the connection to the mainland and new city walls in El-Jadida [9]. Christian families were permitted to settle in El-Jadida and practice their religion [9]. The arrival of a Jewish community in the mid-19th century contributed to the cosmopolitan image of El-Jadida [9].\n\nSultan alaouite Sidi Muhammad ben Abd Allah rebuilt Casablanca in the 18th century after the Portuguese evacuated Mazagan in 1769 [17]. The rebuilding of Casablanca was partly motivated by the fear of a Christian counter-offensive after the evacuation of Mazagan [17]. Sidi Muhammad ben Abd Allah sought to fill the defensive gap between Rabat and Mazagan by rebuilding Casablanca [17].\n\nEl Jadida obtained UNESCO World Heritage status in 2004 under the name \"Ville portugaise de Mazagan (El Jadida)\" [25]. Hassan II and Muhammad VI sought UNESCO recognition for the fortress of El-Jadida to promote tourism [9]. Mazagan (now El Jadida) has been a UNESCO heritage site since 2004 [2]. In 2004, the Portuguese City of Mazagan (El Jadida) was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List [9]. Mazagan was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2004 [15].\n\nThe Mazagan Beach Resort, a single hotel in the Mazagan complex, advertises car transfers from Casablanca Airport [22]. Mazagan, located near El Jadida, was one of the five resorts planned for the Atlantic coast as part of the Plan Azur [20, 29]. The Plan Azur aimed to create six new coastal resorts, but only Mediterrania Saïdia (opened in 2009) and Mazagan (opened in spring 2010) were realized [22]. The Mazagan resort is located about an hour south of Casablanca and is served by Casablanca's airport [22].",
