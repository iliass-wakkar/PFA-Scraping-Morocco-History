  "article_text_raw": "# The First Moroccan Crisis: A Geopolitical Confrontation\n\n## Background and Context\n\nThe First Moroccan Crisis, also known as the Tangier Crisis, unfolded between 1905 and 1906 and centered on the struggle for control over the Sultanate of Morocco [4, 6, 15]. This crisis is considered a key moment in geopolitical confrontation among major world powers [4]. Morocco's strategic and economic importance attracted the attention of European powers, including France, Germany, Great Britain, and Spain [15, 57, 94]. The crisis was an outgrowth of events extending back to the Congress of Berlin [15]. By the beginning of the 20th century, Morocco was the only independent state in the Maghreb [49].\n\nFrance sought to establish a protectorate in Morocco, a move that was formalized by the Treaty of Fez in 1912 [2, 50, 52]. However, France's ambitions were complicated by existing agreements and the interests of other European powers [2, 15]. The Madrid Convention of 1880 guaranteed equal economic access to Morocco for all signatory powers [2]. The Entente Cordiale, signed between England and France on April 8, 1904, settled colonial disputes, with France recognizing British occupation of Egypt in exchange for British permission for France to institute reforms in Morocco [2, 15, 37]. Secret articles of the Entente Cordiale contemplated the eventual partitioning of Morocco between France and Spain [15].\n\n## German Intervention and the Tangier Visit\n\nGermany, under Kaiser Wilhelm II, opposed French influence in Morocco [9, 15]. Germany's grievances included ignored economic interests, a blow to national prestige, and apprehension over the Anglo-French agreement [15]. Germany's total tonnage of ships calling at Moroccan ports in 1905 was larger than France's, highlighting German economic interests [15]. Germany hoped to obtain the port of Casablanca through the Conference of Algeciras [15]. Germany intervened in Morocco partly to test the relations between England and France [15]. The Russo-Japanese War weakened Russia, leading Germany to act opportunistically in Morocco [15].\n\nEmperor Wilhelm II visited Tangier on March 31, 1905, to support the Sultan of Morocco and challenge the legality of the Anglo-French agreement [2, 15]. Germany argued that the Anglo-French agreement violated the Madrid Convention of 1880, which guaranteed equal economic access to Morocco for all signatory powers [2]. The Kaiser presented himself as the guarantor of the Sultan's independence and sovereignty [50]. This act triggered the First Moroccan Crisis [9, 15]. Chancellor Bernhard von Bülow played a crucial role in guiding German policy during the crisis, convincing the Kaiser to visit Tangiers [2].\n\n## Diplomatic Maneuvering and the Algeciras Conference\n\nFrance initially sought a bilateral agreement with Germany, but Germany insisted on an international conference to decide the future of Morocco [2]. Kühlmann proposed a new international conference on Morocco in early March [3]. Bülow favored the international conference idea after the Kaiser's visit to Tangier [3]. The Conference of Algeciras was called to settle the Moroccan question [15].\n\nPresident Theodore Roosevelt of the United States played a role in the crisis [9, 11, 15, 36]. In January 1905, von Bulow inquired whether the United States would be affected by French administrative reforms in Morocco [15]. On March 6, 1905, Sternburg asked Roosevelt to join Germany in maintaining the open door in Morocco [15]. On April 5, the Kaiser insisted on a conference to decide the Moroccan question, citing German interests and dignity [15]. By May 13, the Kaiser threatened war if support for a conference was not obtained [15]. In late April/early May, Roosevelt attempted to bring England and Germany together, but was accused of being under the Kaiser's influence [15]. On April 22, England pledged strong opposition to Germany acquiring a port on the Moorish coast [15].\n\nThe French Cabinet crisis, resulting in Foreign Minister Théophile Delcassé's resignation, occurred because of the conference issue [15, 22]. Delcassé failed to secure Germany's assent to the French move on Morocco, a major diplomatic blunder [15]. Delcassé opposed any international conference, while Germany threatened war if its demands were not met [22]. Delcassé believed Germany's limited power projection capabilities made its threats less credible, while Prime Minister Maurice Rouvier believed Germany was resolved and capable of punishing France [22]. France agreed to the conference on June 25 after being pressured by the Kaiser via Roosevelt [15]. On July 8, an agreement was reached where Germany pledged to pursue no goal at the Conference that would compromise France's legitimate interests or be contrary to French treaty rights [15].\n\nThe Algeciras Conference concluded on April 7, 1906, granting France significant prerogatives in Morocco [2, 63]. The conference aimed to resolve Franco-German antagonism over Morocco [52]. Henry White was chosen as the principal United States delegate for his diplomatic experience and his sympathy towards the Anglo-French [15]. At the first meeting of the Conference on January 16, 1906, the Duke of Almodovar (Spain) was elected president [15]. By February 7, 1906, there was complete agreement on the matter of tax reforms at the conference [15]. On February 3, Revoil proposed to Von Radowitz that the mandate for the police be shared with Spain as a concession, a French strategy to enlist U.S intervention [15]. On February 4, White expressed support for the Franco-Spanish proposal, stating it met the maximum equity and logic required of France [15]. On February 6, White wrote to Root that France would not yield on the matter of the police [15]. On February 8, Von Radowitz talked with White and Venosta again, proposing that the Sultan have control of the police but with instructors from three secondary powers, a plan White refused to endorse [15]. On February 13, Germany sent a telegram indicating they would rather disrupt the conference than retreat further [15]. From February 14-15, White and Revoil had conversations that resulted in the White-Revoil formula, with the recommendation for Roosevelt to recommend a compromise to the Kaiser [15]. On February 16, White recommended that Germany either accept the French proposals or end the Conference [15]. On March 7, Roosevelt sent a letter to the Kaiser urging acceptance of Roosevelt's recommendations [15]. On March 8, the Austrian delegate proposed a plan to assign French police to certain ports and Spanish police to others, with Casablanca under an Inspector General [15]. On the 14th of March 1906, a French ministerial crisis ended and the Kaiser sent a stronger telegram to Roosevelt denouncing the French [15]. On the 17th of March, Root informed White that The US stood for freedom of commerce and a limited control by France and Spain through a multi-lateral mandate [15]. Roosevelt made a public statement praising Germany and it's leaders on April 12 1906 [15].\n\n## Consequences and Interpretations\n\nThe First Moroccan Crisis highlighted the conflict between Germany's desire for international recognition and its actual status in the eyes of other great powers [2]. The crisis also played a role in the polarization of international relations leading up to World War I [4, 6]. Some historians view the crisis as a major confrontation between Great Powers over a sultanate [6]. The crisis also contributed to the British \"continental commitment,\" with joint British-French staff talks taking place from December 1905 to May 1906 [25].\n\nThe crisis can be interpreted through various theoretical lenses. One perspective suggests that Germany's actions were primarily driven by a need to defend its identity and prestige, which it felt were being ignored by France's actions in Morocco, rather than by purely material or strategic considerations [2]. An alternative interpretation uses an incomplete information game model to explain the actions of players in the early stages of the crisis, as well as British support of France, France's firm stance, and Germany's decision to seek a conference [1].\n\nThe crisis also had a significant impact on Spain [7, 65]. The Moroccan question became a potential solution for Spain after the \"Desastre de Ultramar\" (Spanish-American War) [65]. The crisis contributed to the crisis of Spanish Liberalism in the 1920s [7]. The Spanish army intervened to suppress the threat of revolution [7].\n\n## Moroccan Perspectives and Resistance\n\nTraditional analyses of the Moroccan Crisis often overlook the role of Moroccan socio-political actors and its historical context [14]. A counter-narrative emphasizes agency in the periphery and explores the relationship between empire, emerging Moroccan classes, and the expansion of European capital [14]. Moroccan protest and resistance were widespread and persistent throughout the period 1900-1912 [17]. French colonial policy coded Moroccan resistance as traditional anarchy and xenophobia, ignoring its political meaning [17].\n\n## Ottoman Involvement\n\nThe Ottoman Empire, in collaboration with Germany, supported Moroccan resistance groups against French colonization during World War I (1914-1918) [5, 29]. The goal was to stir up a general insurrection in Morocco and support underground activities of the Central Powers using Spanish Morocco as a base [29]. Enver Pasha, the Ottoman War Minister, planned to send Ottoman officers to Spain in October 1914 to organize war operations in North Africa [29]. Mawlay Abd-al Hafiz, the former Moroccan sultan based in Spain, was a key actor they wanted to involve [29].\n\n## Long-Term Implications\n\nThe First Moroccan Crisis was a significant event in the lead-up to World War I, highlighting the complex interplay of imperial ambitions, national prestige, and shifting alliances [4, 6, 15]. It also had lasting consequences for Morocco, leading to the establishment of French and Spanish protectorates and shaping the country's political and social landscape for decades to come [17, 18, 48].",
