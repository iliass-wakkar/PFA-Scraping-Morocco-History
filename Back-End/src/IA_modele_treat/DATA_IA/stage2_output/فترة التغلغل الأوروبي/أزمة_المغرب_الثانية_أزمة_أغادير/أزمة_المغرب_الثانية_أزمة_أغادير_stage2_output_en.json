  "article_text_raw": "# The Agadir Crisis: The Second Moroccan Crisis of 1911\n\n## Background to the Crisis\n\nThe Agadir Crisis, also known as the Second Moroccan Crisis, occurred in 1911 and exposed the growing tensions between France and Germany, foreshadowing the outbreak of World War I [23]. The crisis stemmed from long-standing imperial rivalries between European powers, particularly France and Germany, over Morocco [13, 15]. Germany's position among the great powers of Europe had endured setbacks since 1890, with Russia becoming an ally of France in 1894 and Great Britain signing an agreement with France in 1904 [4]. In 1907, Russia and Great Britain also came to terms [4]. The Anglo-French Entente of 1904 settled the future of Morocco, with Great Britain agreeing that France might establish a protectorate there [4, 24]. Germany, a signatory of the Madrid Convention of 1880, was not officially notified or consulted about the French protectorate in Morocco [4]. This contributed to Morocco becoming a symbol of Germany's declining prestige [4].\n\nThe Entente Cordiale of April 8, 1904, between Britain and France, was a settlement of colonial disputes, with France recognizing British interests in Egypt in exchange for British recognition of French interests in Morocco [24, 37]. As French ambassador Paul Cambon stated, \"we give you Egypt in exchange for Morocco\" [24]. This agreement laid the groundwork for a closer relationship between the two nations leading up to World War I [37].\n\nThe Tangier Crisis of 1905 was a significant diplomatic conflict between Germany and France over the status of Morocco [20]. German Emperor Wilhelm II visited Tangier on March 31, 1905, asserting support for Moroccan sovereignty and challenging French control [20, 31]. This action stemmed from German concerns about French expansionism and its agreements with Britain and Spain [20]. The crisis escalated as Germany called for an international conference, leading to the Algeciras Conference in 1906, where France's claims were largely upheld, isolating Germany [20]. The Tangier Crisis reinforced the Anglo-French alliance and contributed to the formation of the Triple Entente [20].\n\n## The Crisis Unfolds\n\nIn the spring of 1911, the French Foreign Office decided to seize Morocco, using domestic unrest as a pretext to intervene and protect foreigners in Fez [32]. In April 1911, a rebellion in Morocco led to a French military intervention under the pretext of protecting Europeans and French assets [31]. Sultan Abd al-Hafid was besieged by rebels, prompting French intervention [31]. On May 21, 1911, French troops occupied Fez, and on June 8, Meknes, actions that violated the Act of Algeciras [88, 71].\n\nOn July 1, 1911, Germany escalated the situation by sending the gunboat Panther to Agadir, initiating the Second Moroccan Crisis (Agadir Crisis) [20, 23, 32, 31]. Germany's pretext for sending ships was to assist German companies in the Souss Valley [23]. The deployment of the Panther was also intended to intimidate the British navy, as Germany sought to challenge British naval dominance [31]. Hermann Wilberg, the German sales representative sent to provide the pretext for intervention, arrived three days after the Panther [23]. The German ships Berlin and Panther alternated off the port of Agadir during the crisis [4].\n\nThe German government, specifically Alfred von Kiderlen-Wächter, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, used the French intervention as an opportunity to demand colonial compensations in return for Germany accepting a French protectorate over Morocco [39, 71]. Kiderlen-Wächter attempted to use \"public opinion\" (the press) as a diplomatic weapon during the Second Moroccan Crisis [39].\n\n## International Reactions and Negotiations\n\nThe Agadir Crisis led to a threat of war between France and Germany [23]. London publicly backed French claims in Morocco, solidifying Anglo-French relations [32]. The crisis accelerated secret talks between Brigadier General Henry Wilson and French staff officers, planning possible British intervention [32]. On August 23, a meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence outlined war plans, with civilian ministers accepting the prospect of a British army on the Continent [32].\n\nLloyd George's Mansion House speech on July 21, 1911, clearly spelled out Britain's future action against Germany [35]. Paul Cambon, the French Ambassador to London, viewed the speech as the culmination of growing British irritation with Germany [3]. Cambon suggested encouraging flattering appraisals of Lloyd George and his speech in French newspapers [3]. Grey informed Churchill and Lloyd George of a potential fleet attack, prompting him to warn McKenna [38].\n\nThe Agadir Crisis demonstrated the Entente's evolution into a \"virtual\" alliance, with Grey indicating Britain's commitment to a Continental policy to Dominion prime ministers [32]. Grey's actions during the Agadir Crisis were in response to German claims and actions [57].\n\nConversations between Kiderlen and J. Cambon on July 13 and 14, 1911, indicated that territory in Africa, specifically the Congo, would be acceptable to Germany as compensation [4].\n\n## Resolution and Aftermath\n\nThe Agadir Crisis concluded in early autumn with Germany conceding defeat but receiving territory in the French Congo as compensation [32]. A Franco-German treaty was signed on November 4, 1911, giving France a free hand in Morocco in exchange for ceding some African colonies [23]. The gunboat Panther and the cruiser Berlin left Agadir Bay after the treaty was signed [23]. France obtained a free hand in Morocco by ceding territory in the Congo to the German colony of Cameroon after the Agadir Crisis [67].\n\nThe Agadir Crisis caused Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg and the German government to face financial pressure due to the need for more army funds, leading them to attempt to slow down the naval race [32]. The Haldane mission to Berlin, resulting from the Agadir crisis, failed to achieve a slowdown in naval construction despite German offers of benevolent neutrality [32].\n\nThe Agadir Crisis led to a revamp of the French staff system and General Joseph Joffre taking charge [32]. General Victor Michel was dismissed in Paris due to his defensive strategy against Germany [32].\n\nThe Italian government, watching French advances on Fez, decided to seize Tripoli from the Ottomans in August 1911, leading to a formal declaration of war on September 29, 1911 [32].\n\nIn Berlin, conservative critics assailed the government's meager gains from the Agadir Crisis, leading the Prussian Army to seek more troops and contributing to the arms race [32]. German assessment after the Agadir Crisis led to the conclusion that Britain might enter a war on the side of France and Russia [32].\n\nThe Agadir Crisis significantly increased the likelihood of a major power war in Europe [13]. The crisis contributed to the growing divisions in Europe and the deteriorating conditions that led to World War I [20, 30, 31]. After the Tangier crisis of 1905, Europe became increasingly divided into two heavily armed camps [20].\n\n## The Impact on Morocco\n\nThe Treaty of Fez was signed in 1911, allowing France to establish a protectorate over Morocco in 1912 [31]. Under the Treaty of Fez, France ceded territory in French Equatorial Africa to Germany as compensation [31]. The Franco-Spanish treaty was signed on November 27th, marking a step towards establishing a French protectorate in the Shereefian Empire [49]. Spain defined three zones in Northern Morocco including the Riff, the district of Tetuan, and the Spanish Gharb since 1900 [49]. Spain spent approximately $40,000,000 since 1900 to secure its holdings in Northern Morocco [49]. French troops landed in Agadir on June 15, 1913 [23].\n\n## Socialist Perspectives\n\nThe International's reaction to the Second Moroccan Crisis (1911) was less significant than its reaction to the Italo-Turkish War (1911-1912) [12]. The SPD (Social Democratic Party of Germany) and SFIO (French Section of the Workers' International) were closely involved in the First Moroccan Crisis, which affected the International's response [12]. The International Socialist Bureau (ISB) held a conference in Zurich in 1911 where the Moroccan question was thoroughly debated, but it was decided not to publicize the discussion [12]. Vorwärts and L'Humanité published articles and calls related to the Moroccan question during the crisis in 1911 [12]. Jean Jaurès of L'Humanité wrote about the danger and need for sang-froid during the Moroccan crisis in July 1911 [12]. A call to demonstrate against the war-mongers and for solidarity with French and English brothers was published on the front page of Vorwärts on September 1, 1911, stating that Morocco wasn't worth the bones of a single German worker [12].\n\n## British Domestic Impact\n\nFollowing the 1911 Agadir Crisis, Britain’s defence establishment acknowledged the political and social influence that the fear of invasion wielded in British society [42]. British defence establishment expected public opinion to detrimentally influence strategic operations following the Agadir Crisis [42]. The Invasion Scare of 1914 was sparked by public anxiety at the beginning of World War I [42].",
