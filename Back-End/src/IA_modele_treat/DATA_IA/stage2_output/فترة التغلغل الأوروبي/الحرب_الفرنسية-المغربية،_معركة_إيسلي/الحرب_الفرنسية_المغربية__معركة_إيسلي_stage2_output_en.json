  "article_text_raw": "# The Franco-Moroccan War and the Battle of Isly\n\n## Background: French Conquest of Algeria and Moroccan Involvement\n\nThe Franco-Moroccan War of 1844, culminating in the Battle of Isly, stemmed from the French conquest of Algeria, which began in 1830 [2, 3]. In July 1830, a French expeditionary force landed west of Algiers and captured the city, marking the beginning of a long-term occupation of an Arab country by a European power [1, 3]. The conquest was initiated by Charles X to end Muslim privateering and increase his popularity [2]. Following the capture of Algiers, French troops began plundering, arresting, and killing people [2]. Charles X was deposed in July 1830, and Louis-Philippe became the new ruler of France [2].\n\nAlgerian resistance to the French was led by figures such as Ahmed Bey in Constantine and Abd al-Qādir in the west [2]. Abd al-Qādir's resistance gained momentum, and he concluded a treaty with General Desmichels in 1834, recognizing him as the sovereign of territories in Oran province not under French control [2]. However, conflict continued, and in 1842, Abd al-Qādir was driven into Morocco due to French military action [2].\n\nMorocco, under Sultan Abd al-Rahman (ruled 1822-1859), provided sanctuary to Abd al-Qādir, leading to a crisis in Franco-Moroccan relations [1, 2]. The western border of Algeria, nominally the Tafna River, was porous and shared tribal connections with Morocco [2]. France sought to compel Morocco to expel Abd al-Qādir [2].\n\n## The Franco-Moroccan War and the Battle of Isly\n\nThe crisis over Abd al-Qādir's presence in Morocco led to the First Franco-Moroccan War in 1844 [2]. The culmination of this conflict was the Battle of Isly, fought on August 14, 1844, where the French army routed the Moroccans [1, 9, 10]. The French victory compelled the Sultan of Morocco to expel Abd al-Qādir [2]. The battle is also referred to as having occurred on August 13, 1844 [10].\n\nFollowing events in Morocco in August 1844, King Louis-Philippe decided to create a new room in the Château de Versailles to celebrate the victories of Isly and Mogador [9]. Horace Vernet was commissioned to paint the *Bataille d'Isly* [9]. Vernet traveled to Morocco in March 1845 to document and gather motifs for his new compositions [9]. The *Bataille d'Isly* painting was temporarily placed in the Salle de la Smalah before finding its permanent place in the Salle du Maroc in August 1847 [9].\n\nLetters from Sultan Abd al-Rahman to his son Muhammad (later Sultan Muhammad IV, ruled 1859-1873) were found in Muhammad's camp on August 14, 1884, at the end of the Battle of Isly [1]. These letters, along with others acquired in 1920 by the library of the French Protectorate in Morocco, are key sources for assessing the impact of the Battle of Isly on Abd al-Rahman's attitude towards the French [1].\n\n## Aftermath and Consequences\n\nThe Treaty of Tanger (September 10, 1844) closed the Moroccan territory to Abd el-Kader [9]. Abd al-Qādir eventually surrendered to French forces in 1847 [2]. The Franco-Moroccan War of 1844 forced Morocco to stop supporting Algerian rebels against the French and accept the French-established border between Morocco and Algeria [6].\n\nThe Moroccan defeat at the Battle of Isly awakened Morocco to the military potential of modern European states and prompted initial modernization efforts in the army and administration [5, 10]. Following the Battle of Isly, Morocco signed commercial treaties with several European countries [10]. The defeat also influenced the Alawite dynasty's decision to maintain a policy of isolation to avoid foreign influence [8].\n\nThe Battle of Isly and its geopolitical and economic consequences marked a key date shaping European rivalries in pre-colonial Morocco between 1844 and 1890 [5]. The expansion of France in Algeria (1830) and Tunisia (1881) put pressure on Morocco, leading to the Treaty of Fes in 1912, which established the French Protectorate over Morocco [10]. The Franco-Moroccan War contributed to France's aim to build a second colonial empire in the Maghreb [6].",
