  "article_text_raw": "# The Bombardment of Casablanca and the French Occupation\n\n## Background and Prelude to Conflict\n\nThe French presence in Morocco intensified in the early 20th century, marked by increasing disorder and intervention [51]. The Conference of Algeciras (January 16 to April 7, 1906) strengthened France's economic and military position in Morocco [32]. However, internal unrest persisted, leading to the Treaty of Fez on March 30, 1912, which established the French Protectorate [32, 33]. This protectorate granted France administrative, political, and military control over Morocco [33]. The actual conquest and pacification of the country took twenty-two years after the signing of the treaty [30]. Even before the formal establishment of the protectorate, tensions were rising. The murder of Dr. Émile Mauchamp in Marrakech on March 19, 1907, served as a pretext for French military action [35, 51]. Hubert Lyautey used this event as justification for the French occupation of Oujda, a significant step in establishing the protectorate [35].\n\n## The 1907 Bombardment of Casablanca\n\nOn July 30, 1907, nine Europeans were massacred in Casablanca, precipitating the French decision to occupy the city [25, 51]. This massacre prompted the French government to send the warship 'Galilée' to protect the French consulate and French nationals [25]. On August 5, 1907, the 'Galilée' landed a small troop of 66 men, who faced gunfire at the Porte de la Marine [25, 42]. This landing led to fighting and the subsequent bombardment of Casablanca [25]. The decision to bombard the city was met with criticism from other powers and members of the French parliament [25]. A French expeditionary force was concentrated at Oran and escorted to Casablanca by warships [25]. The expeditionary force, consisting of 2,000 men under General Drude, landed in Casablanca on August 7, 1907, at noon, replacing the marines [25, 51]. The VI/1er RE (Foreign Legion) also landed on August 7 to defend against attacks from the Chaouia tribes [51]. The French bombardment of Casablanca is depicted in the postcard 'La France au Maroc', showing the carnage [10].\n\n## The French Occupation and Colonial Administration\n\nFollowing the bombardment, Casablanca came under French control [8]. The French were responsible for maintaining order in the city after the 1907 riots [45]. The French occupation of Morocco, including Casablanca, was interrupted by World War I (1914-1918) but resumed methodically in 1920 [30]. The French faced resistance in various regions, including the Middle Atlas, south of the Grand Atlas, and the region of Taza [30]. Casablanca served as a base to subdue the Chaouia tribes [51]. The French colonial administration introduced modern public health measures and work discipline [10]. Colonial settings, like Morocco, were used to experiment with welfare society norms before they were implemented in France [10]. French urban planning in Morocco during the colonial period involved two approaches: \"techno-cosmopolitanism\" and \"middling modernism\" [7, 10]. \"Techno-cosmopolitanism\" aimed to integrate general planning principles with specific cultural and social contexts, operationalizing history, society, and culture [7]. Modernization under French colonialism involved identifying and operationalizing Moroccan tradition to achieve health, productivity, and efficiency [7].\n\n## World War II and Operation Torch\n\nFollowing France's defeat by Nazi Germany in June 1940, Morocco, as a French protectorate, fell under Axis dominion [2, 8]. Casablanca came under Vichy authority [2]. Marshal Philippe Pétain, head of the Vichy regime, also led France's colonial possessions, including Morocco [2]. In November 1942, Anglo-American forces landed in French North Africa as part of Operation Torch [4, 6, 8, 43]. The Allied landing occurred on November 8, 1942 [4]. General Eisenhower was the Commander in Chief of Operation Torch [8]. The operation aimed to capture Casablanca, Oran, Algiers, and Tunis [8]. French Casablanca came under bombardment early in the morning of November 7 by American admirals [8]. American troops advanced towards Casablanca on land along the Casablanca-Rabat highway against French artillery fire [8]. Allied forces defeated the Vichy resistance in Casablanca after an intense bombardment from November 8-11 [2]. French Casablanca surrendered on November 11 after experiencing heavy losses [8]. After the victory against Axis defenders, the Americans allowed the French to temporarily hold power in Casablanca [8]. The Vichy French were defeated in Morocco, ending Axis rule in the region [8].\n\n## The Casablanca Conference and Moroccan Nationalism\n\nThe Allies convened the Casablanca Conference from January 14-24, 1943 [1, 2]. President Roosevelt and Churchill met with Resident General Noguès and Sultan Sidi Mohammed Ben Youssef [2]. President Franklin D. Roosevelt visited Moroccan King Muhammad V in a suburb of Casablanca and promised him independence [8]. Roosevelt's promise generated a wave of Moroccan nationalism [8]. The support of the United States and the United Kingdom for Moroccan independence angered French authorities [8]. In 1945, a famine occurred in Morocco, for which the French did nothing, while the Americans offered food aid [8]. Muhammad V praised the American government in Tangier, ignoring praise to the French government, in the presence of French officials [8]. France exiled Muhammad V in 1952, causing the citizens of Morocco to associate their nationalism with Muhammad V’s exile [8]. France restored Muhammad V to the throne after facing public disapproval and a revolution in Morocco [8]. In 1955, Muhammad V met with the French Foreign Minister in Paris and declared the end of a “minor jihad” to gain independence [8].\n\n## Vichy Rule and its Impact\n\nCasablanca came under Vichy authority in June 1940 [2]. Sultan Sidi Mohammed ben Youssef signed decrees on August 5, 1941, mirroring Vichy's anti-Jewish laws, restricting Jewish professional options, education, and residence [2]. In November 1941, Moroccan Jews were to cease practicing prohibited professions or face imprisonment and fines, though exemptions were possible [2]. Léon René Sultan lost his French citizenship and was disbarred due to Vichy laws; he continued to advocate against the protectorate authorities [2]. Forced labor camps in Morocco housed Eastern European Jews and political prisoners, with approximately 7,000 prisoners, about one-third Jewish, building the Trans-Saharan Railway [2]. Hélène Cazes Benatar established the Moroccan Refugee Aid Committee to assist refugees in Morocco during the Vichy period [2]. President Roosevelt met with Resident General Noguès in Casablanca in January 1943 and expressed views on limiting the number of Jews in professions in North Africa [2].\n\n## Post-War Developments and Independence\n\nAfter the Allied liberation in November 1942, Algerian Jews like Leon Sultan had to wait months to regain French citizenship and Moroccan Jews to regain employment and living quarters [2]. Léon René Sultan founded the Moroccan Communist Party in 1943 [2]. The Istiqlal party released its Manifesto of Independence in Morocco on January 11, 1944, demanding independence under Sultan Sidi Mohammed Ben Youssef [2]. Jacques Lemaigre Dubreuil actively participated in the \"African resistance\" and helped prepare the way for the Allied landings in November 1942 [28]. He was assassinated in Casablanca on June 11, 1955, by French \"counter-terrorists\" due to his support for Moroccan independence [28]. By 1956, Morocco gained its independence [62].\n\n## The French Air Force in Morocco\n\nThe French military aviation dates back to 1909 [41]. During World War II, Curtiss P-40F Warhawks were delivered to Casablanca, French Protectorate of Morocco on January 9, 1943, for the Aviation of the Army of Africa of Giraud [41]. During Operation Torch, French Curtiss H.75 Hawks opposed US Navy F4F Wildcats [41]. The French Air Force was also involved in the Algerian War (1952-1962) [41].\n\n## The Spanish Red Cross and French Competition\n\nFollowing the French naval bombardment of Casablanca in 1907, the Société de Secours aux Blessés Militaires (SSBM) sent a group of twelve nurses to Casablanca [59]. Inès de Bourgoing, who later became the wife of Maréchal Lyautey, was among the nurses sent to Casablanca in 1907 [59]. The Spanish Red Cross was marginalized by French competition in French-controlled Casablanca [59].",
