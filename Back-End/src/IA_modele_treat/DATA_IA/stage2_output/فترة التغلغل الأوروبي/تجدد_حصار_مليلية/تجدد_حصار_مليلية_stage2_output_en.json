  "article_text_raw": "# Renewed Sieges of Melilla: A History of Conflict and Control\n\nMelilla, a Spanish city and port located on the Mediterranean coast of Morocco, has a long and complex history marked by sieges, conflicts, and shifting power dynamics [4]. From its initial conquest in 1497 to modern-day challenges related to migration and border control, Melilla has been a focal point of tension between Spain and Morocco, as well as a strategic location in the broader Mediterranean region [6, 4].\n\n## Early History and Initial Sieges\n\nMelilla was conquered on September 17, 1497, by Juan Alonso de Guzmán, the third Duke of Medina Sidonia [36]. Gibraltar served as a logistical center during the conquest and as a subsequent port of supply for the newly acquired enclave [73]. The Duke administered Melilla until 1556, when it was relinquished to the Spanish Crown [36]. The Muslim response to the conquest was immediate, with attacks by Riffians and 3,000 soldiers sent by the King of Fez [56].\n\nFrom the 15th century to the mid-18th century, Melilla's territory was limited to approximately one square kilometer [36]. The city was constantly harassed by bordering tribes and suffered frequent sieges [36]. A drug laboratory in Malaga supplied medicines to pharmacies in the hospitals of Melilla, Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera, and Alhucemas [54].\n\nIn the late 17th century, there was a siege of Melilla that lasted 40 days [43]. In 1694 and 1696, the Moors attempted to besiege Melilla [43]. The Fuerte de San Lorenzo was built in 1583 but was lost in the 1678 siege by the Sultan of Morocco, Muley Ismail [27]. Muley Ismail Ben Xeríf continuously besieged Melilla during the transition from the Austrias to the Bourbons [38].\n\n## The 18th Century: The Siege of 1774-1775\n\nThe siege of Melilla by Moroccan Sultan Mohammed III from December 9, 1774, to March 19, 1775, represents a significant event in the city's history [28, 34, 35]. Mohammed III aimed to expel the Spanish from North Africa, rearming with English support to attack Spanish plazas [28]. The Spanish defense was led by Irish Marshall Juan Sherlock [28].\n\nThe initial Spanish garrison in Melilla consisted of 776 men from the Regimiento Fijo de Melilla, but reinforcements increased the forces to 3251 soldiers [28]. Approximately 40,000 Moroccan soldiers began the siege, using artillery imported from England and operated by European artillerists [28]. Juan Sherlock organized the evacuation of women, children, and the elderly from Melilla [28]. Spanish forces successfully countered Moroccan mining strategies through countermining and the use of explosives [28]. On January 9, Spanish forces launched an offensive on Moroccan trenches, causing approximately 700 casualties [28]. On February 14, a major Moroccan assault on the Fuerte de la Victoria was repelled by Spanish artillery and rifle fire [28].\n\nMohammed III lifted the siege on March 16, 1775, and the last Moroccan soldiers withdrew on March 19, 1775 [28]. Estimates suggest around 12,000 projectiles fell on Melilla during the siege [28]. Spanish casualties are estimated between 105-117 dead and 509-584 wounded, while Moroccan casualties are estimated between 1,400 and 15,000 dead [28]. The Spanish victory secured Melilla under the sovereignty of Carlos III [28].\n\nThe kasbah of Djenada, also known as the Santiago quarter, was built by the Guelaya Rifeños at the end of the 18th century after the siege of 1774-1775 [32]. It acted as a headquarters for a network of trenches surrounding Melilla, used to constrict the city [32]. The Alcazaba or Rifeño quarter of Djenada, also known as the \"cuartel moro de Santiago,\" was an Islamic fortification that served as the head of a network of trenches that encircled Melilla [31].\n\n## 19th Century Expansion and Conflicts\n\nIn the 19th century, the first war with Morocco resulted in the expansion of Melilla's boundaries, recognized in 1860 [29]. Conflicts with Riffians arose in 1871 due to their disregard for the Sultan's pacts [29]. The Margallo War in 1893 was triggered by the construction of a fort in Sidi Guariach, leading to Riffian attacks and the death of General Margallo [29]. In 1893, six thousand Rif warriors besieged Melilla, forcing inhabitants to take refuge inside the old walled enclosure [29]. The Spanish government responded by sending warships to bombard Riffian positions, requiring 22,000 soldiers to recover external positions [29].\n\nThe population of Melilla grew significantly after the Margallo War, reaching approximately 30,000 by the end of the 19th century [29]. In 1864, free residence was permitted in Melilla, leading to the growth of the Mantelete neighborhood outside the old citadel [29].\n\n## The 20th Century: Rif War and Spanish Civil War\n\nIn 1904, Spain and France agreed to divide Morocco, leading to the establishment of the Spanish Protectorate [29]. In 1909, the Rif War began after Riffians killed several mine workers, resulting in Spanish military action and the mobilization of 42,000 reservists [29]. In 1921, the Spanish suffered a major military defeat at Annual, leading to a widespread retreat and the loss of territory and equipment [29]. In 1925, Spanish troops, commanded by General Francisco Franco, landed in Alhucemas, marking the beginning of the end of the Rif rebellion [29].\n\nThe coup d'état that triggered the Spanish Civil War started in Melilla on July 17, 1936 [36]. Franco relinquished territories claimed by Morocco and Equatorial Guinea under pressure, while retaining Ceuta and Melilla [12].\n\n## Modern Challenges: Migration and Border Control\n\nIn the late 1990s, Melilla experienced an increase in illegal immigrants crossing the border [36]. In October 2005, the \"siege\" of Ceuta and Melilla by thousands of immigrants was a major issue [11]. Spain tried to defend its borders by erecting a three-meter high fence around the enclaves, with plans to raise it to six meters [11]. At least 11 people were killed in the wave of immigrants trying to cross the fence [11]. Spain renewed an accord with Morocco allowing Spain to deport all immigrants to Morocco, regardless of their country of origin [11].\n\nThe erection of razor wire fences at the US-Mexico border in 2018 brought to mind similar fences in Ceuta and Melilla, Spanish enclaves in Morocco [7]. The use of razor wire fences in Ceuta and Melilla is linked to efforts to control migrant movement [7]. Thousands of migrants live in camps in the forests behind Ceuta and Melilla, referred to as \"ghettos\" by the migrants [15].\n\nIn May 2021, Morocco opened its borders with Spain, prompting migrants to cross, which generated tensions [4]. On June 24, 2022, at least 37 migrants died in Ceuta and Melilla during an attempt to cross into the enclaves [4]. Morocco, due to its “advanced statute” in relations with the European Unit, has taken up the control of the borders of Ceuta and Melilla [16].\n\n## Contemporary Melilla\n\nMelilla is described as a modern European city, while Nador, Morocco, is described as a city in a marginal region of northeastern Morocco [25]. The two cities are separated by a 10-kilometer border [25]. Tens of thousands of Moroccans cross the border daily to purchase goods in Melilla, a free port [25]. The border is described as a point of significant political, economic, and strategic importance [25]. The border is reputed to be a hub for illegal economic activities, such as smuggling and drug trafficking [25].\n\nMelilla's Estatuto de Autonomía was approved in 1995 [36]. Elections were held in Spain on May 28, 2023, to decide the composition of municipal councils, including the assemblies of the two 'Autonomous Cities' of Ceuta and Melilla [17].",
