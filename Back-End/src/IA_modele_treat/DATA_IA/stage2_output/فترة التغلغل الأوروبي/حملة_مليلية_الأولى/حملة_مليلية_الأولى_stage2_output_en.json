  "article_text_raw": "# The First Melilla Campaign: Conflict and Colonialism in 1909\n\n## Background and Context\n\nThe First Melilla Campaign, also known as the Melilla War or the Gurugú War, took place in 1909 [65, 20]. This conflict was rooted in Spain's long-standing presence in Morocco, dating back to the Middle Ages [5]. By 1911, Spain was the only foreign power with a foothold on Moroccan soil, possessing the cities of Melilla and Ceuta, as well as the island presidios of Penon de Velez de Gomera, the Alhucemas, and the Zaffarines [5]. Melilla, a Spanish territory of 12 km2 located in northeastern Morocco, had been under Spanish sovereignty since 1497 [15]. It initially served as a prison colony for nearly four centuries before its economic and political transformation began in the second half of the 19th century [15]. Melilla was declared a free port in 1863 [14, 15].\n\nThe Algeciras Conference in 1906 established French supremacy over Morocco but acknowledged Spanish influence in northern territories [14]. This led to the implementation of the Spanish Protectorate of Morocco in 1912 in the Rif, Ifni, and Tarfaya regions [11, 14]. However, Ceuta and Melilla were not included in the Algeciras convention, as Spain considered its rights over these territories to predate the Protectorate [14].\n\n## Causes of the Conflict\n\nSince 1909, Spanish forces had been expanding from Melilla towards the Rif heartland [19]. By 1921, they had almost reached Alhucemas Bay [19]. The 1909 Melilla campaign was influenced by the economic opportunity opened by the protective mission of the Spanish army in Morocco awarded by the Algeciras Conference [31]. Mining resources became a priority for Spanish oligarchs, which prompted an economic penetration into a region of Morocco controlled by a series of tribes [31].\n\nThe construction of a Spanish fort at Sidi Ouriach was a key factor leading to the conflict [17]. The Rif tribes petitioned against the fort's construction because it interfered with their mosque and cemetery [17]. General Margallo threatened punishment to anyone who attempted to interrupt the work [17]. The Kabyles opposed the construction of the fort, perceiving its strategic importance for controlling their movements [17]. The fort's proximity to a shrine frequented by Moorish women was also cited as a cause of the outbreak [17].\n\nThe war was triggered by a confluence of political and economic interests surrounding the exploitation of the Guelaya mines [83]. The assassination of Spanish workers on July 9, 1909, served as the immediate catalyst for the war [29, 83].\n\n## The War\n\nOn July 9, 1909, Riffian tribesmen attacked a military outpost protecting Spanish workers building a railway to serve mines near Melilla, killing four workers and one sentry [29]. On July 13, 1909, six thousand Riffians attacked a force of two thousand Spaniards [29]. On July 23, 1909, tribesmen engaged Spanish forces for a third time [29]. The Spanish government reinforced its forces with 40,000 reserves due to the conflict near Melilla in 1909 [29].\n\nMoroccan tribes attacked the Spanish garrison at Melilla on October 2, 1893, with Spanish casualties reported and reinforcements ordered [17]. The Kabyles destroyed the fort in question on October 3 [17]. General Margallo was killed in a sortie on October 29 from Melilla [17]. Around 15,000 Spanish troops under General Arsenio Martinez de Campos were needed to restore order near Melilla in 1893 [29].\n\nThe Spanish losses in recent fighting at Melilla were seven killed (including General Margallo) and thirty wounded [17]. The official report from General Margallo (dated October 4) stated the Moorish attack forced the laborers and their guards to take refuge within the shed which was being constructed near the site fixed upon for the fort of Sidi Aguariach [17]. The official report stated the Spanish losses were 15 killed, 4 missing, 3 officers and 34 regulars and convicts wounded, and 13 bruised, with the enemy loss estimated at 4,000 [17].\n\nThe Spanish government aimed to strengthen the Sultan's position, requesting British support in urging the Sultan's government to prevent further aggressions by the Kabyles [17]. The Spanish Minister of War was empowered by the Government to take the requisite measures that the expeditionary force destined for Melilla should consist of from 7,000 to 8,000 men [17].\n\n## Spanish Military Response\n\nThe Spanish government reinforced its forces with 40,000 reserves due to the conflict near Melilla in 1909 [29]. The call-up of troops for the colonial conflict in Morocco led to anti-war protests in Barcelona, known as the \"Tragic Week\" in late July and early August 1909 [29, 31].\n\nThe Aerostation Service deployed to Melilla for the first time on July 27, 1909, under the command of Captain Antonio Gordejuela, contributing to reconnaissance and artillery spotting [96].\n\nAs a consequence of the 1909-1910 campaign, Spanish forces moved out from Melilla and occupied an enclave stretching from Cape Tres Forcas to the southern shore of Mar Chica [29].\n\n## The Role of Air Medical Transportation\n\nThe First Melilla Campaign marked the beginning of air medical transportation in Spain [13, 94, 95]. The geography of the Rif and Yebala regions, combined with the significant number of casualties from modern weaponry, necessitated the use of aircraft to transport the wounded to hospitals, some of which were located over 100 km from the front lines [94]. The Spanish military aviation was a pioneer in Morocco, and Commander Mariano Gómez Ulla played a crucial role in the urgent evacuation of the wounded [94].\n\nEvacuation circuits were established between aerodromes like Saina Ramel (Tetuán), Auamara (Larache), Ceuta, Arcila, the Atalayón base in Melilla, and Zeluán [94]. Tablada (Seville) served as the main base for medical supplies and receiving evacuees [94]. The first airplane for medical transport arrived in Seville in May 1923 for use in the war in Morocco [13].\n\nOn November 1, 1922, Dr. Nogueras’ team was transported to Dar-Drius camp in Melilla via airplane to treat multiple injured people [13]. Nurse Elvira López Maurín participated in the November 1, 1922 flight to Dar-Drius, becoming the first nurse to fly on a health mission in Spain [13].\n\nThe first sanitary airplane, Breguet XIV Tbis Nº 98, arrived at Tablada aerodrome (Seville) in May 1923 and joined the Nador aerodrome (Melilla) on May 23, 1923 [13]. The first transfer of a wounded soldier, Lieutenant Ordinales, occurred on June 8, 1923, from Dar-Drius to Nador (Melilla) [13].\n\n## The Use of Armored Vehicles\n\nThe Spanish Army used armored vehicles during the Rif Rebellion, specifically focusing on the initial deployment and challenges faced [19]. Spain rushed the Foreign Legion and Regulares to defend Melilla [19]. Spain acquired Renault FT-17 tanks from France and deployed them in the March 18, 1922, battle of Ambar [19]. The tanks experienced a less than successful debut due to factors such as the separation of infantry and tanks, faulty ammunition, and lack of coordinated training [19]. Tanks were used in the amphibious landings at Alhucemas Bay in September 1925 [19].\n\n## Social and Political Impact\n\nThe call-up of troops for the colonial conflict in Morocco led to anti-war protests in Barcelona, known as the \"Tragic Week\" in late July and early August 1909 [29, 31]. The Wolf Ravine defeat in 1909, during the Melilla campaign, generated violent left-wing protests in Barcelona [31].\n\nThe disastrous campaign in Melilla in 1909 contributed to Spain's neutrality during World War I [20]. Spain's army was in no condition to participate in alliances or a European war due to its inefficiencies [20].\n\nThe 1893 Melilla War, also known as the \"War of Margallo\", is described as a significant event in Spanish-Moroccan relations [17]. The British archives contain 132 diplomatic correspondences, telegrams, and consular reports related to the 1893 Melilla conflict between the Rif tribes and Spanish forces [17].\n\n## Aftermath and Legacy\n\nAs a consequence of the 1909-1910 campaign, Spanish forces moved out from Melilla and occupied an enclave stretching from Cape Tres Forcas to the southern shore of Mar Chica [29]. The campaign of 1909 ended with the army seizing Quebdana and Guelaya in November 1909 [69]. 4,131 dead and wounded and 100 million pesetas were spent in the campaign [69].\n\nThe Spanish consolidation of gains near Melilla following the 1893 war is mentioned [52]. The fortifications of the border in Ceuta and Melilla were just the first steps towards a stricter control of the whole Spanish southern border [9]. In January 1998 Juan Cotino (PP), chief executive officer of the Spanish national police from 1996 to 2002, announced the implementation of an enforcement project called “Plan Sur” [9].\n\nThe events of 1909 and the subsequent campaigns in Morocco had a lasting impact on Spanish military doctrine, colonial policy, and public opinion, shaping the course of Spanish history in the 20th century [63, 68, 69].",
