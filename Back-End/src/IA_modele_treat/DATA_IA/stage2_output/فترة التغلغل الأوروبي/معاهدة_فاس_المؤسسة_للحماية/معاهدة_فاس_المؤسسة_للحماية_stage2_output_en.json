  "article_text_raw": "# The Treaty of Fez and the Establishment of the French Protectorate in Morocco\n\n## Background and Context\n\nThe Treaty of Fez (معاهدة فاس), signed on March 30, 1912, between France and Morocco, marked a pivotal moment in Moroccan history, establishing the French Protectorate over the country [1]. This event was the culmination of increasing European influence and internal strife within Morocco [1]. Prior to the treaty, Morocco faced numerous challenges, including a weakened state, internal rebellions, and financial instability [1]. Sultan Hassan I attempted reforms in the late 19th century, but faced resistance [1]. The defeat in the Battle of Isly in 1844 further weakened Morocco and increased European influence [1]. After Hassan I's death, Sultan Abd al-Aziz's reign (1894-1908) was characterized by financial instability and internal rebellions, including the Zerhouni rebellion in 1901 [1]. Moulay Hafid began considering taking over from his brother Abd al-Aziz as early as 1907 and was proclaimed Sultan in Fez on August 15, 1907, under conditions of expelling Europeans [1].\n\nEuropean powers, including France, Spain, Italy, and Great Britain, had been vying for control over Morocco [1, 8]. France signed various agreements with these powers between 1904 and 1911 to pave the way for its control [1]. The Algeciras Conference in 1906 affirmed the sovereignty of Morocco while opening the door to greater European involvement [1]. The Franco-Spanish Convention of 1904 aimed to balance French and Spanish interests in Morocco [26]. However, the Agadir Crisis in 1911 heightened tensions and accelerated the process leading to the French protectorate [1, 33]. Germany sent a gunboat to Agadir amidst an uprising against Sultan Abdelhafid, prompting France to send troops to Fez [33]. A definite treaty of diplomatic alliance between France and Morocco was concluded in February 1910 [8].\n\n## The Treaty of Fez\n\nSultan Abd al-Hafiz was ultimately forced to sign the Treaty of Fez in 1912, despite initial resistance [1]. The treaty ceded the sovereignty of Morocco to France and is referred to as the 'Treaty of Protection' [1]. It assigned the task of implementing administrative, financial, and judiciary reforms to the colonial power [6]. The treaty also tasked the Protectorate with modernizing education and the army [6].\n\nArticle 1 of the Treaty focused on implementing reforms while safeguarding the Sultan's status [1]. Article 2 permitted the French government to occupy territories needed for the maintenance of order [1]. Article 3 stated that the French government was to lend constant support to the Sultan and protect him against any danger [1]. Article 4 focused on enabling the Moroccan army to be reorganized under French oversight [1]. Article 5 stated that the French government was to represent the Sultan in all foreign affairs [1]. Article 6 is cited as an example of international agency in practice, where one subject of international law acts on behalf of another [42].\n\n## Establishment of the Protectorate and Initial Policies\n\nFollowing the signing of the Treaty of Fez, France formally established its protectorate over Morocco [16, 17, 18, 19, 28, 30, 33, 41]. Morocco was divided into three zones: a French protectorate, a Spanish protectorate, and the international zone of Tangier [16, 17, 18, 19, 28, 30]. The Franco-Spanish convention of November 27, 1912, established the Spanish protectorate [16, 17, 18, 19, 28, 30]. The international zone of Tangier was set up by France, Spain, and Great Britain on December 18, 1923 [16, 17, 18, 19, 28, 30].\n\nThe French administration, initially under General Lyautey, aimed to establish French control while appearing to respect Moroccan traditions and institutions [1, 15]. Lyautey served as Resident General from 1912 to 1925 [15, 29, 31]. He adopted a policy of respecting Islam and Moroccan customs [15]. Lyautey believed it would be an error not to respect Islam in Morocco, as Islam was in the possession of the Moroccans [15]. The French aimed for economic and moral penetration of Morocco through close association, administering the country through its own government organs and respecting its customs, as opposed to direct rule or annexation [15]. Lyautey emphasized the importance of respecting Islam to ensure smoother administration and the pacification of Morocco [15]. France aimed to restore order, unify the Empire, and re-establish the state in Morocco under the guise of police actions to manage the Makhzen [15].\n\nThe French implemented policies characterized as racial, fiscally biased, obscurantist, antiliberal, colonizing, and assimilative [3]. Public and private investments focused on infrastructure, agriculture, and mining [6]. Colonial agriculture focused on land reform, technological equipment, and exclusive access to foreign markets, disrupting traditional agriculture [6]. Land reform involved privatization of public domain and seizure of tribal lands [6].\n\n## Impact on Moroccan Society and Culture\n\nThe French Protectorate had a profound impact on Moroccan society and culture [7, 10, 29, 31, 45, 51, 57, 66, 67]. The introduction of French into the educational system shaped Moroccan identity [7]. After Morocco gained independence in 1956, the government's language policy aimed to reconstruct Arab-Moroccan national identity by prioritizing standard Arabic in public education [7]. However, French remained the language of the upper classes and is required for fluency in key sectors [7]. The French language became the official language of the colonial administration in Morocco starting in 1912 [66].\n\nThe French colonial administration classified Moroccan society into Arab and Berber ethnic groups [2]. Urban Arabophone nationalist elites and colonial administrators struggled over Arab and Berber ethnic classifications [2]. The French policy aimed at 'de-islamization' of Berbers [2]. The 'Berber Dahir' intensified nationalist sentiment [1, 2].\n\nThe French Protectorate also influenced urban development [4, 12, 51]. The segregation of the medina from the Ville Nouvelle, built for European use, was implemented by French administrators [4, 12]. The French urban and architectural legacy remains prominent in Morocco [12]. The 'Ville Nouvelle' typically featured colonial white concrete buildings with radial and geometrical street designs [12].\n\n## Resistance and the Path to Independence\n\nOpposition to the Treaty of Fez and the French Protectorate led to uprisings and resistance movements throughout Morocco [1, 39, 43]. The tribal rebellion of 1911 provided the justification for the dispatch of a French expeditionary force to Fez [39]. The Rif War (1921-1926), led by ʿAbd al-Krim al-Khattabi, significantly impacted Moroccan nationalism [2]. The Berber Dahir of 1930 intensified nationalist sentiment [1, 2]. The Istiklal Party was founded in 1944 [1]. The M'hammed ben Aboud's manifesto for independence was promoted and it led to demands of Morocco being independent [1].\n\nFrance exiled Sultan Muhammad V in 1953 [1, 33]. This led to riots and active opposition [33]. The end of World War 2 and America supporting Morocco led to the termination of the French Protectorate [1]. France granted Morocco formal independence in 1956, and Spain forfeited their protectorate along the northern coast [33]. France formally ended the Treaty of Fez in 1956, recognizing Morocco's independence and sovereignty [1]. The negotiations for Moroccan independence concluded in March 1956 [49]. French recognition of Moroccan independence was partly due to internal disunity caused by radical Moroccan nationalism [49].\n\n## The Spanish Zone and its Impact\n\nThe Treaty of Fez also led to the establishment of a Spanish zone of influence in Morocco [33, 36]. Spain controlled the northern coast of Morocco minus Tangiers and the Spanish-occupied areas of the Sahara, while the French ruled supreme everywhere else [33]. The Spanish Protectorate was established by the Franco-Spanish convention on November 27, 1912 [16, 17, 18, 19, 28, 30].\n\nThe Spanish Protectorate also implemented its own policies and faced its own challenges [79, 85, 90, 92, 93, 94, 95, 101]. The Spanish army undertook significant infrastructural development [79]. The Spanish Protectorate also saw the implementation of a new legal order [93, 94, 95]. The Spanish faced resistance from the local population, leading to military action and pacification efforts [85]. The Disaster of Annual in 1921 was a significant event in the Spanish Protectorate [52, 90].\n\n## Aftermath and Legacy\n\nFollowing the end of the French and Spanish protectorates in 1956, Morocco faced the challenge of building a new, independent nation [1, 33, 49, 65, 67, 84]. The newly emancipated state had three key elements: an administrative apparatus, modern infrastructure, and the Makhzen tradition allied with the colonial tradition [65]. The government implemented a language policy prioritizing standard Arabic in public education [7]. However, French remained the language of the upper classes and is required for fluency in key sectors [7]. The Moroccan state elites attempted to nullify the impacts of the French Protectorate through the promotion of 'Moroccan-ness' and 'African-ness' [3].\n\nThe legacy of the Treaty of Fez and the subsequent French Protectorate continues to shape Morocco today [7, 12, 51, 66]. The French urban and architectural legacy remains prominent in Moroccan cities [12]. The French language is considered the most visible trace of French colonization in Morocco [66]. The Moroccan government continues to grapple with the challenges of balancing tradition and modernity, navigating its relationship with Europe, and addressing socio-economic inequalities [3, 7, 65, 66].",
