  "article_text_raw": "# Anglo-Moroccan Relations: A History of Diplomacy, Trade, and Conflict\n\n## Early Relations and Alliance Against Spain\n\nAnglo-Moroccan relations date back to the 13th century, with an envoy from King John of England seeking military assistance from Sultan Mohamed al-Naṣīr against France [18, 19]. Mercantile and trading opportunities became noticeable around the 16th century [18, 19]. The first known British trading voyages to Morocco occurred in 1551, driven by interest in gold, saltpetre, and sugar [2]. James Aldy's account of this voyage provides insight into early British experiences in Barbary [18]. England and Morocco found common ground against Spain, with Morocco providing saltpetre for English gunpowder in exchange for arms [2]. Elizabeth I chartered the Barbary Company in Morocco, which produced crucial economic and political benefits for England [14]. The Barbary Company was formed in 1585 under the Earl of Leicester to foster trade relations [2]. In 1583, Lord Burghley advised Queen Elizabeth on the suitability of an alliance with Morocco [16].\n\nSa’adī Sultans ‘Abd al-Mālek (1575–1578) and Aḥmed al-Manṣūr (1578–1603) exchanged diplomatic letters with Queen Elizabeth I (1558–1603) to strengthen mutual diplomacies and issue decrees favoring English merchants [18, 19]. Elizabeth I engaged in diplomatic relations with the Barbary states, particularly Morocco, selling arms and supplies in exchange for sugar [34]. The alliance grew stronger under Aḥmed al-Manṣūr, particularly after the defeat of the Portuguese in 1578 at the Battle of Alcazar [18, 19]. This alliance granted England unprecedented protectionist privileges at sea, while Morocco gained substantial power and diplomatic recognition [18]. England’s victory over the Spanish Armada in 1588 changed al-Mansur’s impression of Elizabeth and prompted him to propose a joint attack against Spain [14]. Drake's expedition against Lisbon in 1589 was planned with the expectation of Moroccan support, which ultimately did not materialize [2]. Moroccan ships possibly aided the English at Cadiz in 1596, according to intelligence from the Fugger merchants [2]. In 1596, Elizabeth’s ships and soldiers, along with ships and supplies from al-Mansur, were victorious in their attack on Cadiz [14, 28]. Morocco provided logistical assistance to the English attack on Cadiz in 1596 [8].\n\nElizabeth I and her government considered a formal alliance with Morocco, proposed by Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur, but it was never consummated [2]. Al-Mansur proposed a military venture against Spain to Queen Elizabeth [9]. Elizabeth's disinclination towards the military venture against Spain was a negotiation tactic for English profitability [9]. In 1600, Abd el-Ouahed ben Messaoud visited London to confirm the collaboration between Elizabeth I and Ahmad Al-Mansur [5]. Al-Mansur sent another delegation in 1600 to England, but they disagreed on jointly invading Spain [14]. In 1601, al-Mansur proposed an attack on Spanish holdings in the Americas to Elizabeth, which she rejected [14]. In 1602, al-Mansur signed a military agreement with Spain against their joint rival, the Ottoman Empire [14].\n\n## Cooling Relations and Piracy in the 17th Century\n\nAfter the death of Aḥmed al-Manṣūr and Queen Elizabeth I, political instability in Morocco under Mūlay Zaydān (1608–1627) caused tensions in Anglo-Moroccan relations [19]. James I's accession led to a cooling in relations with Morocco [2]. James I aimed to consolidate relations with Spain [15, 16]. The volatile European climate of the early seventeenth century forced Charles I to focus inwardly [15].\n\nDuring this period, Barbary pirates operating out of Algiers, Tangiers, Tunis, Tripoli, and Salé disrupted international trade in the Atlantic and Mediterranean [5]. English shipping suffered from the depredations of Barbary corsairs, causing anxiety due to the capture and forced conversion of English mariners [5]. The King of England viewed North African pirate citadels as a hindrance to commercial expansion and an affront to national pride [5]. The Sultan of Morocco considered the pirate citadels a threat to his regional pre-eminence, viewing them as rebels or forward operating bases of the Ottoman Empire [5]. In 1626, the Moriscos of Salé concluded a treaty with British emissary John Harrison to secure independence [2]. Charles I refused to ratify Harrison’s treaty with the Moriscos of Salé [2]. British naval assistance aided in the siege of Salé [2]. Mulay Muhammad wrote to Charles I after the siege of Salé, emphasizing joint interests in trade and suppressing rebellion [2].\n\nJawdar bin Abdallah's Moroccan embassy in 1637 aimed to build on cooperation against the rebel-pirates at Salé and was received with enthusiasm in London [2]. The account of Jawdar bin Abdallah's embassy in 1637 described the sultan in glowing terms and emphasized the benefits of trade [2]. The Moroccan embassy to London in 1637-1638 had a significant place in Caroline foreign policy [5].\n\n## Tangier and Renewed Relations\n\nThe English occupation of Tangier in 1661 marked an early instance of British presence in the Islamic World [24]. After the British evacuation of Tangier in 1683, Mulay Ismail attempted to renew good relations with Charles II, offering to provision British ships [2]. Mohammed bin Hadou's Moroccan embassy arrived in 1682 and was celebrated in London [2].\n\n## 18th Century Diplomacy and Trade\n\nIn the 18th century, Morocco sought to replace piracy with official trade [32]. Sidi Muhammad b. 'Abd Allah ruled Morocco from 1757 to 1790 [32]. Sidi Muhammad aimed to build a European-style navy, including a war fleet and a merchant fleet [32]. A major objective for both Christian nations and the Moroccan sultan was the redemption or exchange of captives [32]. Morocco concluded a treaty with Great Britain on July 28, 1760, related to the supply of Gibraltar [32, 33]. This treaty was prompted by the capture of 334 English subjects after three English ships wrecked on the Moroccan coast in 1758 [33]. The main articles of the 1760 Anglo-Moroccan peace treaty are documented [33]. Morocco signed trade treaties with Denmark, Sweden, Spain, Venice, Genoa, France, Portugal, the Netherlands, Hamburg, and Prussia [32]. Relations between Morocco and France deteriorated, leading to the departure of the French consul general Louis Chénier in 1781 [32].\n\n## 19th Century: Trade, Abolitionism, and Imperialism\n\nThe article \"Ceuta in Anglo-Moroccan Relations, 1806-1815\" examines Anglo-Moroccan relations during 1806-1815 [3]. The article discusses Mulay Sulayman's (1792-1822) reign and the accusation that he isolated Morocco [3]. The article argues that the European situation, specifically the Napoleonic Wars, contributed to Morocco's isolation [3]. After the British drove the French from Egypt, Mulay Sulayman sought British support [3]. Mulay Sulayman sought British assistance in 1806 to recover Ceuta from Spain [3]. In 1808, Spain became a British ally against France [3]. The Congress of Vienna in 1814 confirmed Spain's claim to Ceuta [3].\n\nJames Richardson, a British explorer and anti-slavery activist, sought to convince Sultan Mawlay Abderrahman (r. 1822-1859) to abolish slavery in Morocco in 1843-44 [13]. In 1842, pressure mounted on Morocco from British international abolitionist campaigns to end the slave trade [13]. The Anglo-Moroccan Commercial Treaty was signed on December 9th, 1856 [13]. The General Treaty of 1856 between Britain and Morocco allowed for British consuls in Moroccan towns and allowed British subjects to travel and live in the Sultan of Morocco's dominions [23]. The signing of the Anglo-Moroccan \"Convention of Commerce and Friendship\" in 1856 marked the beginning of Morocco's decline into anarchy and loss of independence [27]. John Drummond Hay was Britain’s Representative Plenipotentiary in Morocco from 1845 to 1886 [27].\n\nMoroccan merchants, mainly from Fez, relocated to Manchester in the 1830s [20]. Treaties between Morocco and Britain granted subjects the right to travel and trade in each other's country, beginning with the Treaty of Peace and Commerce in 1751 and subsequent renewals in 1760, 1791, 1801, and 1824 [11, 20]. English tea became Morocco's national beverage due to commercial encounters between Britain and Morocco [11, 20].\n\nBritish informal empire created a crisis over Moroccan sovereignty in the late nineteenth century [22]. The thesis analyzes letters between Sultan Hassan I and local leaders in the Sous regarding black-market ports opened by British trading companies [22].",
