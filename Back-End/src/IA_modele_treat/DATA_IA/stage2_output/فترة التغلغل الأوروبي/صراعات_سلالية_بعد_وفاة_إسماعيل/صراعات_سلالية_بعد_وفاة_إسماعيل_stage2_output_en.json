  "article_text_raw": "# Dynastic Conflicts Following the Death of Ismail\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe phrase \"صراعات سلالية بعد وفاة إسماعيل\" translates to \"Dynastic Conflicts Following the Death of Ismail.\" This article synthesizes information from various sources to explore instances of succession struggles and internal power conflicts that occurred after the death of rulers named Ismail in different historical contexts. These include, but are not limited to, the Alaouite dynasty in Morocco after the death of Moulay Ismail in 1727 [15, 17, 18, 19, 24, 27], the Safavid dynasty after the death of Shah Ismail I in 1524 [9, 16], and the rule of Khedive Ismail of Egypt, whose deposition in 1879 led to political instability [2, 23, 26]. The article also examines succession issues in other dynasties, such as the Ptolemaic dynasty in Egypt [4], the Al Sabah dynasty in Kuwait [5], and the Nasrid dynasty of Granada [31, 32], to provide a broader understanding of the dynamics of dynastic conflicts.\n\n## Morocco After Moulay Ismail's Death (1727)\n\nFollowing the death of the Alaouite sultan Moulay Ismail in 1727, Morocco entered a period of significant instability and civil war [10, 15, 17, 24]. This period, lasting until 1757, was marked by numerous contenders vying for the throne [10]. The possession of dynastic emblems, such as the sultan's parasol, horses, saddles, javelots, and lances, became crucial for establishing royal legitimacy [15]. The recovery of these emblems was a primary objective for those seeking to claim the throne [15].\n\nDuring this time of turmoil, various local leaders and factions seized control of cities and regions. For example, Abdelhaq Fennich controlled Salé from 1738 to 1757 [18, 19, 27], making Bab Sebta the seat of his caïdat [27]. The people of Salé destroyed the Kasbah of the Gnaouas in 1738 in response to the actions of the guards stationed there [19]. In 1736, Moulay ‘Abdallah was deposed by the inhabitants of Fez, and Mohammed b. ’Arbiyya was installed on the throne [15]. The Jewish community also suffered during the thirty years of disorder following Moulay Ismail's death [17].\n\nThe Alawite rulers, including Moulay Ismail, used an army and administration to maintain the divisions of communities and repress any profound disruption of a social scheme that they aimed to dominate completely [20]. The monarchy sought to maintain control of change by placing itself at the heart of the royal power, under its aegis and its dependence, and to achieve this, the Alawites had to crush the 'founding' cities [20].\n\n## Safavid Dynasty After Ismail I's Death (1524)\n\nShah Ismail I, leader of the Safavids, seized Tabriz in 1501 and established Shia Islam as the official religion [9]. Upon Ismail's death in 1524, his son Tahmasp, aged ten, became Shah [9]. The coronation of Tahmasp I on June 2, 1524, triggered a decade-long power struggle among the Qizilbash clans [16]. These clans, including rumlu, chamlu, stadjlu, takkalu, zolghdar, afshâr, qâdjâr, and warsāk, sought to regain influence after being sidelined since 1508-1510 [16]. Div Sultan Rumlu initiated hostilities by murdering Jalal al-Din Mohammad Tabrizi and established a regency based on alleged testamentary dispositions of Ismail I [16]. Sam Mirza replaced Tahmasp as governor of Khorasan [16]. Tahmasp's brothers included Alqas Mirza (1515-1550), Sam Mirza (1517-1566), and Bahram Mirza (1517-1550) [16].\n\nIsmail I bequeathed an empire of three million square kilometers, stretching from the Euphrates to the Amou-Daria, to his son Tahmasp [16]. The early life of Ismaïl I was marked by uncertainty, with seven loyal individuals providing a regency under Kar Kia Mīrzā Ali to ensure the survival of the Safavid order in 1493 [7]. Rustam attempted to eliminate Ismaïl during the six years he lived in Lāhījān [7].\n\n## Egypt After Khedive Ismail's Deposition (1879)\n\nKhedive Ismail ruled Egypt from 1863 to 1879 [3, 23]. He was deposed in 1879 due to financial catastrophe and international pressure [2]. He was replaced by his son, Tawfiq Pasha [2]. Ismail's reign saw a revival of educational and cultural institutions despite the increase in foreign debt and European pressure [26]. A Caisse de la Dette Publique was established in 1876 due to the increase in foreign debt, leading to Franco-British control [26]. The British occupation of Egypt began in 1882, influencing political developments following Ismail's departure [2]. The Orabi revolution (1880-1882) was a consequence of financial problems and growing discontent in Egypt [2]. The British occupation in 1882 led to the exile of Urabi and the restoration of Khedive Tawfiq's authority [2].\n\n## Other Dynastic Conflicts\n\nDynastic conflicts have been a recurring theme in various historical contexts. In the Ptolemaic dynasty of Egypt, the period from 163 BC to 80 BC saw internal conflicts within the royal family and the growing role of queens [4]. Transitions of power often involved violence, and pretenders to the throne, especially those based in Cyprus, sought to conquer the throne [4]. Ptolemy VI Philometor, Ptolemy VIII Euergetes II, Ptolemy IX Soter II, Ptolemy X Alexander, Cleopatra II, and Cleopatra III were key figures in these power struggles [4].\n\nIn Kuwait, the death of Emir Jabir al-Ahmad al-Jabir Al Sabah in January 2006 led to a succession conflict involving the Al Jabir and Al Salim branches of the Al Sabah dynasty [5]. Sheikh Sad al-Abd Allah al-Salim Al Sabah succeeded Jabir al-Ahmad but was quickly deemed unfit to rule due to severe health issues [5]. Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad Al Jabir became the new Emir of Kuwait [5].\n\nThe Nasrid dynasty of Granada also experienced frequent internal conflicts and power struggles [31, 32]. Of the 21 emirs mentioned by Fernando de Pulgar, 9 were assassinated [31]. The origin of dynastic conflict stemmed from the usurpation of the throne from Abenhut Alnayar (Ibn Hud) by the first Nasrid emir, Muhammad I [31].\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDynastic conflicts following the death of a ruler have been a recurring feature of many societies throughout history. These conflicts often arise from uncertainties in succession, power struggles between different branches of the family, and external pressures from other powers [4, 5, 9, 10, 16, 17, 24, 31, 32]. The examples of Morocco after Moulay Ismail's death, the Safavid dynasty after Ismail I's death, and Egypt after Khedive Ismail's deposition illustrate the diverse ways in which these conflicts can manifest and the significant impact they can have on the stability and development of a region [2, 10, 16]. Understanding the dynamics of these conflicts provides valuable insights into the complexities of power, succession, and political stability in historical contexts [20, 21].",
