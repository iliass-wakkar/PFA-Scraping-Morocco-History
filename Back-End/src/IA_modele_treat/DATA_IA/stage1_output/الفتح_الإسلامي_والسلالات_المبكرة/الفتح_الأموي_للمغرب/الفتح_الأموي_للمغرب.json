The paper discusses the Islamic conquest of the 7th century, which initiated the integration of the Far and Central Maghreb into the Islamic world. The process involved commercial, political, and intellectual connections with Middle Eastern centers. Religious missionaries and political dissidents also arrived in the Maghreb. The Umayyads and Fatimids utilized the Maghreb as a battleground, and the conflicts led Berber imamates to rely more on the Western Umayyads in Al-Andalus. The Maghreb became part of a transregional commercial network, including the slave trade, and adopted Islamic legal practices, religious doctrines, and scholarly elites. The influence of Maliki scholars grew, leading to the adoption of the Maliki legal school. By the tenth and eleventh centuries, the Maghreb was integrated into Sunni mainstream Islam.",

It examines works by Aḥmad ibn Khālid al-Nāṣirī, French colonial scholars Ernest Mercier and Émile-Félix Gautier, and Moroccan nationalist ʿAllal al-Fāsī, exploring how they framed historical writing, defined historical objects (people, territory, dynasty, or religion), rendered them chronologically and narratively, and linked historical events. The thesis considers the historical contexts in which these narratives were written, examining how historians' interpretations of the past reflected their present circumstances and visions for the future. It analyzes the central historical objects in each text and the historical narrative itself. It highlights how concepts function in the narratives, and the role the concept of Maghrib al-Aqṣā plays. It further examines the Islamic conquests of Northwest Africa in the seventh century, noting different portrayals and interpretations. The thesis also discusses how instantiations of historical writing connected to the contemporary ideological stances of the authors. The text includes chapters analyzing Al-Nāṣirī's focus on the spatial concept of the Maghrib al-Aqṣā, Mercier's and Gautier's use of 'North Africa' and racial categories, and al-Fāsī's assertion of Maghribī patriotism. It offers a detailed account of how Mercier and Gautier conceptualized North African space and geography.",

            "The historical writings of Ernest Mercier (1840-1907) and Émile-Félix Gautier (1864-1940) are narratives about the region of “North Africa” and its inhabitants, the Arab and Berber races.",

The abstract describes how ʿAbd al-Raḥmān III, the Umayyad ruler of al-Andalus, established political relationships with Berber emirs in the Far Maghrib. The article analyzes a letter from the Maghrāwa emir Muḥammad b. Ḫazar to the Andalusian court of Córdoba in 317 AH (929-930 CE), discussing the rhetorical strategies used by the emir to justify his allegiance to the Umayyad caliphate. The letter and the relationships it represents were preserved in the Muqtabis fī aḫbār ahl al-Andalus of Ibn Ḥayyān al-Qurṭubī (377/987–469/1076). While it does not directly discuss the initial Umayyad conquest, it sheds light on Umayyad control and interactions in the Maghrib (Morocco) shortly after the conquest period, detailing relationships with Berber leaders. This helps to understand how the Umayyads consolidated power and maintained control after the initial conquest. Therefore, the document is relevant, although indirectly, to the long-term effects and consolidation period following the Umayyad conquest of the Maghrib.",

The article highlights Walīla's significance as a Berber center, a possible Umayyad or Abbasid garrison location, and the initial capital of Idrīs I, the founder of an early Islamic state in Morocco (Idrisid dynasty). The article addresses the period after the Muslim conquest and the Berber revolts, covering the 8th and 9th centuries and the transition from Roman Volubilis through the early Islamic era to its abandonment in the 10th century, with a brief reoccupation in the 14th century. The excavations reveal insights into urban transformation, architecture, diet, burial practices, trade links, and the potential presence of Arab settlements outside the town walls. The study analyzes two primary areas: the 'Berber town' (Area A) and the 'Arab quarter' (Area E), investigating the differences in architecture, lifestyles, and consumption patterns. The article discusses the establishment of an Umayyad or Abbasid settlement outside the Roman walls, its subsequent destruction and expansion, and the minting of coins under the name of Walīla, linking those actions to the Umayyad conquest and control and subsequent Idrisid influence.",

The study traces Shia influence to the period before the Idrisid (172-375 AH) and Fatimid (297-567 AH) uprisings, identifying Berberian advocates of Ahl-al-Bayt, proponents of Imam Sadiq (AS), and Alavians as key groups in the dissemination of Shi'ism.

          "source_summary": "This chapter by Corisande Fenwick focuses on the Idrisid state in the Maghrib al-Aqsa (modern Morocco and western Algeria) as rivals to the Abbasid Caliphate in the late 8th and early 9th centuries. While the text does not directly address the initial Umayyad conquest (الفتح الأموي للمغرب), it discusses the political landscape shortly after, including the emergence of rival states following the Kharijite revolt and limited Umayyad presence in the region. It explores the rise of the Idrisids, their claims to legitimacy based on descent from Ali, their challenges to Abbasid authority through coinage and territorial expansion, and their interactions with Berber tribes. The chapter also details the founding of Fez as a new capital and analyzes the archaeological evidence from Walila (Volubilis) to understand the interactions between the Idrisid rulers and the local Berber population. The summary includes details on Idris I's arrival, the Awraba tribe's support, military expeditions, the minting of dirhams, Idris I's assassination, the reign of Idris II, and the establishment of Fez, all of which occurred in the aftermath of the Umayyad conquest and constitute a significant element of early Islamic state building in the region. Although the core topic is the Idrisids, the text provides context and details concerning the dynamics established after the Umayyad conquest, thereby contributing valuable insights to understanding the longer-term impact and subsequent power struggles related to that early phase of Islamic expansion in North Africa.",

AD 700–900). The authors, Stephen W. Merkel, Jani Oravisjärvi, and Jane Kershaw, employ lead isotope and trace element analyses on over 100 dated silver coins from North Africa to Central Asia to provide a geochemical perspective. The study identifies previously unrecognized silver sources stretching from Morocco to the Tien Shen and notes an Abbasid-period mining boom. These findings have implications for the geopolitics of the era, especially along the Islamic-Byzantine frontier, and are thus directly relevant to understanding the economic context related to the \"الفتح الأموي للمغرب\" (Umayyad conquest of the Maghreb). The article discusses the limitations of relying solely on literary texts and highlights the need for archaeometric methods to understand the mining activities and trade networks associated with the early Islamic state. The study examines Umayyad and Abbasid dirhams from mints across the Caliphate, including North African mints like Kairouan and al'Abbasiya, which are in the region of present day Tunisia, and discusses how silver from Morocco likely travelled eastwards to these mints. The research also identifies a hitherto unrecognised ore source for North African dirhams, which lies in Tunisia itself. Overall the article offers a detailed investigation of the silver sources used during the Umayyad and Abbasid periods, including those relevant to North Africa.",

The study uses lead isotope and trace element analyses to determine the geographical origins of the silver. The findings challenge existing text-based narratives of early Islamic silver mining, proposing a new geochemically based model of Umayyad/Abbasid wealth resources. The study reveals that the Umayyads initially relied on recycled Sasanian silver, but later gained access to fresh silver ore sources in Iran. For the Abbasids, North African dirhams were sourced from Morocco and Tunisia. Silver for Iraqi dirhams, particularly in Baghdad, came from the Islamic-Byzantine frontier in the Taurus Mountains. Iranian mints were supplied by ancient silver mines in central Iran. Silver for Central Asian mints was mined on the western Tien Shan. The study challenges the notion that Arabian mines were a significant source of silver, highlighting the importance of previously overlooked areas like Tunisia, central Iran, and the Taurus Mountains. This research directly relates to the Umayyad Caliphate in North Africa as it covers silver mining in North Africa following the Arab conquests in the late 7th century and North African Dirham minting. Furthermore, the article provides detail on the conquest of North Africa starting in AD 702 and Spain starting in AD 711 and the effect on silver influx to Wasit as taxes and booty.",

The abstract notes that some Berber languages retain only a few non-Arabic number words, while others preserve a complete inventory. The study investigates the intensity of borrowing within languages, influenced by mutually comprehensible varieties of Maghrebi Arabic. The research establishes a typology of numeral borrowing in Arabic-Berber contact, showing how linguistic, social, and cognitive factors impact the process, and considers the emergence of synonymy during the adoption of new systems.

It details Muhammad's life, the tenets of Islam, and the initial expansion of the Arab armies under the early Caliphs. The text highlights the Umayyad Caliphate's role in consolidating these conquests, including their expansion across North Africa to the Atlantic by 700 CE and subsequent invasion of Spain in 711, which are relevant to the broader context of the \"الفتح الأموي للمغرب\" as Morocco is part of North Africa. The text mentions the Umayyad governance, their administration, the role of other faiths within the caliphate, and the eventual overthrow of the Umayyads by the Abbasids. It also touches upon the cultural and intellectual achievements of the Islamic empires, particularly during the Abbasid period, and their interactions with Europe.",

It argues that the early Islamic state, particularly under the Umayyads, played a crucial role in investing in and organizing the economy through policies like urbanization and monetization. The article highlights the standardization of currency, weights, and measures, and the spread of Arabization and Islamization, which facilitated trade and economic growth. It further examines the legacy of these policies in successor states, using Egypt and Morocco as case studies, and concludes that while the initial investments made during the Empire period were significant, the later economic trajectories of these states were also influenced by individual circumstances and global conditions. The article references the Arab conquest of Egypt and Morocco's subsequent rise as a military power in the Western Mediterranean.",

It argues that a victory for the Sasanian Empire at Nihavand would have likely established the Zagros Mountains as the frontier between the Muslim Caliphate and Iran. The text hypothesizes about the political, religious, linguistic, economic, and cultural developments that might have transpired in Iran and within the broader Islamic world had the Arab conquest not occurred. Specific points include the potential survival of the Sasanian dynasty as one of several polities, the possible absence of a unified Iran and a standardized New Persian language, the survival of Zoroastrianism alongside other religions (including potentially a greater spread of Buddhism), and a different trajectory for Islamic culture, including a possible shift in the centers of Islamic learning and power away from Iran. It posits that without the Arab conquest, Iranian national identity and its contributions to Islamic civilization would have been significantly different, and the Muslim world might have developed with a stronger emphasis on Arabic culture centered in Syria and Egypt. The text also touches upon trade, agriculture, and urbanization patterns in a hypothetical non-conquered Iran.",

It highlights the Umayyad's improvements in government administration, finance, economy, and justice while acknowledging their negative aspects. The paper discusses the establishment of the Mazalim Court, the Umayyad's economic activities, and the reasons for the dynasty's relatively short reign (90 years). It also details the administrative structure of the Umayyad state, including the various Diwans (bureaus) and the appointment of governors. Although it discusses the Umayyad Dynasty's administration in general, there's mention of the expansionist policies and the vast conquered area, which is crucial for understanding the context in which the conquest of North Africa took place. Details of administrative divisions, governorships, economic control of vast territories and the state's need to maintain order are closely tied to supporting and enabling military conquests like \"الفتح الأموي للمغرب\".",

It highlights how Islam initially aimed to reform the understanding of slavery by granting slaves social rights. During the Umayyad Caliphate, the economy relied on slave labor in agriculture and animal husbandry, with a discriminatory view based on Arab ethnocentrism that created a distinction between 'mawali' (non-Arab converts) and other slaves. The Abbasids later abolished this race-centered understanding and employed slaves extensively in the military. The Ottoman Empire inherited this social and economic framework from the Seljuks, evolving into a sharecropping system.

The article investigates the history of madhhabs in Andalusian Islam, aiming to identify the prevailing and officially recognized schools.

It highlights the maritime activities of Muslim Andalusians and Moroccans, including trade, diplomacy, military operations, and exploration. The document notes that the Umayyad rulers of Cordoba created a naval squadron to patrol the Atlantic coast of al-Andalus in response to Viking raids, establishing naval bases at Ageciras, Silves, and Alcacer do Sol. These fleets successfully defeated Viking raids in 966 AD and 971 AD. The document also mentions figures like Khashkhāsh Ibn Sa’id Ibn Aswad, who fought Viking raiders, and the \"Adventurers of Lisbon,\" who explored the Atlantic. Further, the text discusses the economic expansion of the Moroccan Atlantic coast in the 12th century and the construction of a naval arsenal at Sala during the reign of the Marinid sultan Ya‛qūb al-Manṣur (1258-86 AD). It touches upon the evolution of ship design, potentially influenced by Arab-Andalusian forms, and the role of the Algarve region in Portuguese overseas exploration. The text also mentions a Moroccan fleet destroying a Castilian-Spanish fleet near Algeciras in 1340 AD. Finally, the text analyzes some archeological finding to identify ship building features and relate them to those used by Muslim Andalusian and Moroccan sailors in the Atlantic.",

The study suggests that droughts occurring at 545–570, 695–725, 755–770, and 900–935 CE contributed to the instability of both the Visigothic and later Muslim reigns. Specifically, the period of 695-725 CE is identified with the maximum drought conditions of the last 5000 years, coinciding with the Umayyad Caliphate's expansion into the Iberian Peninsula starting in 711 CE and the final conquest in 726 CE, impacting agriculture and socio-political stability.

By analyzing pollen records from the western Mediterranean, the study identifies statistically significant drought periods between the mid-5th and mid-10th centuries CE (450–950 CE) at 545–570, 695–725, 755–770 and 900–935 CE. The research suggests that the drought from 695-725 CE, the most severe of the last 5000 years, played a significant role in the Visigothic Kingdom's decline and the Umayyad Caliphate's expansion, starting in 711 CE and concluding with the conquest of 726 CE. This drought, coupled with existing political and social instability, likely affected food production and weakened the Visigothic state, contributing to its collapse and the successful initial consolidation of al-Andalus. The study also examines the relationship between these drought periods and historical sources, including chronicles documenting famine, plagues, and civil wars. It suggests that climate change towards more arid and colder conditions in the late-7th and early-8th centuries CE acted as a catalyst for the Muslim invasion. Other drought periods are linked to Muslim political destabilization and civil wars after the establishment of the Umayyad Caliphate. Finally, the article explores the potential climate mechanisms behind these droughts, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and solar activity.",

The reviewers raise concerns about the paper's central hypothesis linking droughts directly to historical events, its use of documentary and archaeological sources, and the methodology used in constructing a stacked pollen record. Specific comments focus on the role of droughts in the Visigothic Kingdom's crisis, the expansion of the Berber/Arab army in the 8th century, and the subsequent crises of the Andalusian state. The reviewers question the simplistic relationship between climate and socio-cultural change, advocating for a more detailed discussion of the socioeconomic impacts of droughts. The discussion includes the Islamic expansion in the Iberian peninsula and the possible influence of climate crisis on the Islamic expansion in the Iberian Peninsula and internal socioeconomic crises in Iberian Muslim kingdoms during the subsequent centuries. The reviewers also ask about the impact of recorded drought episodes in the Iberian Peninsula over larger areas of the Western Mediterranean, particularly Northern Africa, which might have favored migrations and expansion of Islamic people towards northern latitudes.",

            "The historical sources and pollen data indicate that extreme arid events occurred during some crucial historical processes in Iberia including the Visigothic Kingdom crisis and the Islamic expansion, and the internal riots during the Umayyad Caliphate and the Emirate of Cordoba between the 7th and 10th centuries.",

The article examines the efforts of Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan to bring the Maghreb back under Umayyad rule and the efforts of his appointed leader, Hassan ibn al-Nu'man al-Azdi, to complete the conquest and organize the region. It analyzes the difficulties encountered during the conquest, the dangers faced by the state's armies, and the reasons behind Abd al-Malik's choice of Hassan ibn al-Nu'man to lead the armies. The summary details Hassan's military operations, including his victories against the Romans, the capture of Carthage, and his campaigns against al-Kahina in the Aures Mountains. It mentions Hassan's initial defeat, his subsequent request for reinforcements, and his eventual victory over and killing of al-Kahina, ending the resistance. It also describes how Hassan divided the Maghreb into administrative districts and appointed officials, often locals, to manage taxes and zakat. The research further examines Hassan ibn al-Nu'man's policy of tolerance towards all inhabitants of the Maghreb, regardless of ethnicity or religion, as well as his organized efforts to spread Islam and Arabize the Berber tribes, and his equal treatment of Berber converts, which led to political stability and loyalty to the Umayyad state, making Hassan a popular figure in the Maghreb.",

While the text mentions the Arab-Islamic conquest briefly, it focuses on the iqṭāˁ system, its development, and application during subsequent dynasties, including the Almoravids, Almohads, Marinids, and Wattasids. It argues that the weakness of central powers between the Arab conquest and the Almohads hindered the development of the iqṭāˁ system. The Almohads, with their centralized administration, used fiscal concessions as rewards. Later dynasties, notably the Marinids and Wattasids, employed the system to assert authority over tribes. The study highlights the legal and fiscal aspects of the iqṭāˁ, its relation to land ownership, and how it differed from the feudal system in Europe. It also details how different rulers used the iqṭāˁ to reward military personnel, officials, and allied tribes, and how the system evolved from centralized tax collection by state agents to direct tax collection by the beneficiaries.",

It mentions that the Iberian Peninsula, known as Al-Andalus, benefited from various historical sources like Arabic chronicles, Latin sources, and archaeological research. Before the conquest, the Visigothic kingdom was in crisis due to social conflicts, slave flight, and anti-Jewish aggression, as well as economic issues like natural disasters and trade slowdowns. In 710, Roderic took power in a palace revolution against Akhila. The text states that this situation made Spain vulnerable to Muslim conquest. Mûsâ b.

Uqba's army consisted of 10,000 cavaliers. The account credits Uqba with the systematic conversion and incorporation of the conquered populations, particularly Berbers, into his army.

Les révoltes Berbères\" from the book \"Histoire du Maghreb médiéval VIIe-XIe siècle,\" discusses the Berber revolts in the Maghreb during the 8th century. It explains how, after the Arab conquest and Islamization, a strong Berber opposition emerged against Arab rule. This opposition was largely influenced by Kharidjite doctrine and led to several revolts. These revolts occurred when the Umayyad caliphs in Damascus were facing challenges from Shi'ite and Kharidjite rebellions. The revolts also affected al-Andalus, which experienced increasing tensions between northern (Qaisites) and southern (Yemenites) Arabs. The text highlights the middle of the 8th century as a pivotal moment in North African history. Many historians view these Berber revolts as a direct consequence of the Arab conquest and the excesses of Umayyad governors in Kairouan. While most Berber tribes had embraced Islam and participated alongside Arab fighters in campaigns in al-Andalus and southern Gaul, they faced humiliation from the Damascus government, particularly in the second quarter of the 8th century. The Yemeni caliphs Sulaymân (715-717) and ‘Umar II (717-720) initially favored the Berber population, but the situation deteriorated under later Qaisite caliphs.",

It explores how Roman traditions persisted in architecture and ornamentation, sometimes being common to other Islamic forms and other times unique to the Iberian Peninsula. The article specifically mentions that the Islamic conquest introduced a new order and faith, and it considers the apparent paradox of Roman influences surviving the three centuries following the Islamic conquest. It notes that Muslim art was shaped over centuries by the restrictions of Islam and by the union and struggle of artistic currents, including the long-incorporated Hellenistic tradition from the Roman Empire. The author also dedicates the study to the memory of Pierre Paris and recounts meeting him in Rabat in 1921, where Paris encouraged him to study the monuments of Morocco to understand the art of Muslim Spain.",

The Idrisids, initially pro-Umayyad, were heavily impacted by the conflict between the Fatimids and Umayyads of al-Andalus. They lost Fes and were persecuted by Musa b. Abi al-'Afiya, switching allegiances between the two caliphates due to their desire for independence and unstable alliances. The article explores the complex political and ideological motivations of the Idrisids, caught between the Shiite Fatimids and Sunni Umayyads. The article details the alliances and conflicts of various Berber tribes, including the Kutama and Zenata, and the impact of figures such as Musa b. Abi al-'Afiyah on the region. Ultimately, the study examines the Idrisids' loss of independence under the weight of these competing powers.",

          "source_summary": "This article discusses the circulation of Arab coins, specifically Umayyad dinars, in southern France (Narbonnaise) during the 8th and 9th centuries. It examines the discovery of an Umayyad dinar (struck in 709-710 under Caliph al-Walid) near Carcassonne and a Carolingian imitation of an Abbasid dinar in Hérault. The author explores two possible routes for the dinar's arrival: one linked to the Umayyad conquest of Carcassonne in 725 by 'Anbasa ibn Suhaym al-Kalbî, the governor of al-Andalus, and the other a later arrival through Mediterranean trade routes, potentially from Italy. The article argues that the existing understanding of Arab coin circulation in the region primarily associates it with al-Andalus, either through conquest or trans-Pyrenean trade. The discovery of the Umayyad dinar, however, doesn't align with the typical numismatic profile of the conquerors, which consisted of transitional bilingual dinars, oriental dirhams, and fulûs from al-Andalus and North Africa. The article considers alternative routes following previous research and the discoveries of coins throughout Europe. It concludes by suggesting that the dinar and the solidus mancusus from Pouget may have arrived via Mediterranean trade routes, possibly after the Carolingian conquest, circulating alongside Carolingian silver coinage, thus representing a different import route than previously assumed. Ultimately it is unclear whether the Umayyad conquest was how the specific dinar ended up in the region, however the presence of the Umayyad is tied to this invasion.",

It explains the geopolitical context of the rivalry between the Umayyads and Fatimids, the Umayyad expansion into North Africa, the status of Fès, and the mechanisms through which the Umayyads sought to integrate the region into their empire, including military conquest, diplomacy, religious influence (promoting Maliki Islam), and political agreements (bay'a). It emphasizes the role of local elites in Fès in facilitating the Umayyad takeover. The document also details the symbolic acts of submission, such as pronouncing the Khutba in the name of the Cordoban Caliph and minting coins with his image. The allegiance of Fes to Cordoba was short lived, as the Zirid Buluqqin took the city in 979. However, Fes returned to the Umayyad sphere later.",

It highlights the challenges of relying on later, potentially biased historical sources and emphasizes the importance of archaeological data and material culture in understanding this period. The review covers Fenwick's analysis of the Arab conquest, the establishment of Muslim rule, and its impact on urban development, rural life, the economy, and social life in North Africa. Fenwick argues against the traditional view of the conquest as a destructive event, pointing to evidence of urban expansion, agricultural prosperity, and integration into Mediterranean and trans-Saharan trade networks. She also examines the gradual diffusion of Islam and its influence on daily life, as reflected in changes in funerary rites, foodways, and domestic architecture. The review concludes that Fenwick's book offers a valuable contribution to the history of North Africa during the early Islamic centuries by utilizing archaeological evidence to challenge existing narratives and provide a new perspective on the period.",

The review discusses the book's aim to re-evaluate the significance of Islamic presence in the region, particularly during the 8th century, utilizing both textual and material sources. It highlights the difficulties in understanding the Muslim conquest and administration of the Narbonnaise due to limited and sometimes contradictory Arabic sources, as well as the eventual Frankish reconquest led by Pepin the Short and later Carolingian campaigns. The review underscores the book's contribution to understanding the complex interactions between the Frankish kingdom and al-Andalus, emphasizing the need to avoid anachronistic interpretations influenced by later crusading spirit or contemporary Islamophobia.

It highlights the importance of considering both textual and material sources (like the Islamic graves found in Nîmes) to understand the Islamic conquest and presence in the region. The review notes that the book challenges the traditional emphasis on the Battle of Poitiers (732) as the defining event of the Islamic expansion into Gaul, arguing that the Islamic presence and influence in the region were more nuanced and long-lasting. The review also covers the use of both Latin and Arabic sources, including the works of Ibn Ḥayyān and Ḫalīfa b. Ḥayyāṭ, to understand the conquest. It describes the difficulty of understanding the extent of Islamic influence and administration in Narbonnaise, noting that it was likely a dependency of al-Andalus. The review mentions key events like the battle of Toulouse, Charles Martel's campaigns in the 730s, Pepin the Short's recapture of Narbonne in 759, and Charlemagne's expedition against Saragossa in 778, and subsequent raids by the emirs of Cordoba.

It also examines the demographic changes, the role of tribalism, and the position of Arabs and Berbers in the new power structure. The review touches on the Umayyad Caliphate of Damascus and the nature of power in al-Andalus, considering the integration or lack thereof of indigenous women into the Arab aristocracy, and the persistence of Arab dominance in the region. It refers to the period of the conquest (early 8th century) and the subsequent formation of al-Andalus under Umayyad rule. The reviewer critiques Manzano's 'anti-tribalist' stance, raising questions about the number of allogeneic elements that settled in the Peninsula after the conquest and the extent of societal rupture caused by the conquest.",

It examines their motivations, the recruitment networks, and the evolution of their identity within the army. The article highlights the strategic importance of the Strait of Gibraltar and the ambiguous relationship between the Umayyad state and the Maghreb. While Tanger played a minor role during the initial conquest of al-Andalus (92/711), it later became a source of mercenary soldiers for the Umayyad army. The unit of Tangérois soldiers existed for about a century, participating in the 'fitna' that shook the Umayyad Emirate. While initially composed of men from Tanger, the term 'Tangérois' eventually encompassed Berber fighters from various origins. The article also points out that the recruitment of Tangérois soldiers prefigures the later large-scale recruitment of Berber fighters by al-Hakam II and al-Mansur.",

While the Eastern Roman Empire resisted, the Western Roman Empire suffered from the \"Great Invasions\". The Vandals ravaged Gaul (407-409) before settling in Spain (409-429), and subsequently established a kingdom in North Africa (429-533) with Carthage as its capital. Although they confiscated Berber-Roman lands, the text suggests that the economic prosperity of North Africa was not initially severely affected, but indigenous populations were increasingly excluded and exports to Italy decreased. The Vandals engaged in piracy in the Western Mediterranean, contributing to the economic marginalization and impoverishment of Berber-speaking populations, and marking the beginning of a predatory economy in North Africa that lasted until the 19th century. In 455, they sacked Rome for fifteen days. The text also mentions that Rome was previously sacked in 410 by the Visigoths.",

Furthermore, the document talks about the different types of sources that provide information on routes, such as geographical descriptions, chronicles, and travel accounts, and identifies key authors like al-Bakrī and al-Idrīsī. It also addresses the impact of tribal structures on road control and the shift from animal-drawn transport to pack animals.

The article specifically mentions the Mozarabs, who remained Christian but adopted Arab customs and language, and the Muwalladûn, descendants of indigenous people who converted to Islam and often intermarried with Berbers. The text also notes the initial support of the Jewish population, who had previously suffered under Visigothic rule, for the Arab-Berber penetration. The text explains that the Jewish population then maintained its status under Islamic rule. The article emphasizes the diversity beneath the seemingly unified government of the Emirate and Caliphate of Cordoba and points out the architectural achievements that are visible, but also that the foundations of Al-Andalus were formed by a mix of groups. The article provides insights into the social and religious landscape of Al-Andalus immediately following the initial conquest.",

The review, authored by Rémy Gareil, offers a detailed overview of Martinez-Gros's work, which examines the first four centuries of Islam (7th-11th centuries) through the lens of Ibn Khaldun's historical theories. The review discusses Martinez-Gros's novel approach to understanding the rise and dynamics of the Islamic Empire, focusing on concepts like the interplay between \"bédouins\" and \"sédentaires,\" the role of taxation, and the cyclical nature of imperial power. It also touches on how the Islamic world adapted and transformed over time, dividing its history into four \"lives\" or periods. Specifically regarding the Maghreb, it mentions the rise of the Occident musulman during the third \"vie\" (900-1020), noting the challenges faced by the Fatimids from the Maghreb, and in the fourth \"vie\" (1020-1100), the Almoravids' shift of the center of gravity of the Occident musulman towards present-day Morocco.

The research seeks to uncover national differences in the portrayal of the conquest (7th century) and how those differences reflect divergent national constructions. It notes that in Algeria, the conquest is used to promote belonging to an Arab-Muslim community, in Morocco it's downplayed to emphasize the monarchy's Islamic identity, and in Tunisia, it's depicted as one episode in a long national history, highlighting the importance of national territory.

Economic activities remained similar to previous eras, while changes during the Middle Ages were more related to the influence of local ethnicities. The review also highlights that neither the Vandals, Visigoths, Byzantines, nor the Arabs destroyed the cities, and that the Arab conquest (likely referring to the Umayyad conquest) did not cause a catastrophic rupture with the past through destruction or fires. The cities underwent long changes between the 4th and 9th centuries due to social and economic transformations rather than political ones. With the Umayyads, there were no destructions or fires, indicating no catastrophic rupture during the Arab conquest.",

While it does not directly describe the military events of the Umayyad conquest, it discusses the importance of naval power and maritime activity in the subsequent Arab and Islamic presence and influence in the region, including the coastal areas of the Maghreb. It points out that the study of Muslim ports has often been neglected, and explores the challenges in researching them due to limited documentation and historiographical biases. The article discusses the role of the ports in Ifriqiya (Tunisia) and al-Andalus within the context of the spread of Islam in the Mediterranean. While the main focus is on a later period, it implicitly acknowledges the lasting impact of the conquest on the maritime landscape and the establishment of Muslim-controlled port cities.",

The chapter discusses the economic impact of literary manipulation by caliphate scholars, especially in Iberia (peninsula Ibérique) and Ifrîqiya (North Africa), analyzing the economic break between the 9th-century emirates and the 10th-century caliphates. It highlights investments by Mediterranean emirates in the 9th century and how the caliphates utilized previous growth along the coasts of Byzance and Latin regions. It also notes the emergence of trade networks across the Mediterranean, mentioning the trade of bacini ceramics and the activities of Jewish merchants of the Geniza. Further, it examines the strategic coherence of Fatimid and Umayyad caliphates, both aiming to reach Bagdad, and the shift in military objectives with the proclamation of the two caliphates in the early 10th century, emphasizing the conquest of the caliphal seat to govern all of Islam.",

The chapter explores the complexities of assigning identities to populations based on archaeological evidence and foreign texts, especially when language is unknown. It argues that most populations are formed from a mixture of ethnic elements, with a common pattern being a smaller group of immigrants conquering a region and assimilating the local population.

While not directly about the initial Umayyad conquest itself, the text explores the pre-existing Andalusian presence in the region that facilitated later cultural and social developments. It highlights the migration of Andalusian families, including the Tabbin family, to North Africa due to political instability in Al-Andalus, starting as early as the 8th century with the Berber revolts, and more significantly during the Almoravid and Almohad periods. The text argues that this migration created a cultural landscape that influenced the later development of Tetouan. It analyzes the biography of Tabbin, his family's history tracing back to Córdoba, and his eventual settlement in Tetouan, where he established a mosque and contributed to the spiritual life of the local communities. The text also delves into the historical context of Granada and the broader Al-Andalus, mentioning key events such as the conquest of Toledo by Alfonso VI, the Almoravid victory at Zalaca, and the rise of the Almohads. The source questions and assesses the reliability of some historical claims made about Tabbin and his contemporaries, aiming to clarify the timeline and context of his life. Ultimately, this is about an important pre-cursor to future events after the Umayyad conquest laid initial foundations, looking at the Andalusian presence in the region centuries after the initial conquest.",

Published in 2021, it examines the settlement patterns and toponyms of the eastern Rif region (between Alhucemas and the current Moroccan-Algerian border, including the provinces of Nador, Driouch, and Taourirt) during the medieval centuries. The study analyzes toponymic references from written sources (geographical, historical, bio-bibliographical) and historical and current cartography. It also compares these findings with the results of archaeological visits, surveys, and excavations. The paper focuses on spaces such as Tazouda (Qal'at Yara), Ghassasa (Alcudia), and Melilla, tracing the evolution of their toponyms and proposing insights into the entity and evolution of their settlement. The paper intends to connect human societies and political formations with material remains in the region during the medieval period. While it doesn't directly address the Umayyad conquest itself, it explores the subsequent settlement and the evolution of the region during the medieval period, providing context for understanding the long-term impact of the conquest.",

The text highlights that the Umayyad Caliphate developed a perception of the Iberian Peninsula as al-Andalus and it describes the political organization developed by the Umayyad emirs of Córdoba. The text mentions the work of Ibn ‛Iḏārī al-Marrākušī, whose chronicle covers the Islamic conquest of the Maghreb in the 7th century through the Almohad period. It also discusses the political re-articulation of the Iberian space after the Islamic conquest and resulting division. The article further examines the social, cultural and religious transformations, the implementation of Islamic norms by Andalusian ulemas, Christian architecture in Islamic territory, and archaeological findings related to the Islamization of Cordoba, including the destruction of the arrabal of Šaqunda in 818 by al-Ḥakam I. The text touches on the Umayyad Caliphate's peak under ‛Abd al-Raḥmān III and the founding of Medina Azahara in 936 or 940. It also looks at the conflict between Muslim and Christian societies, courtly protocols for military campaigns against Christians, and the differing visions of reunifying the Iberian Peninsula.",

While the main focus is on Al-Andalus, it discusses the Umayyad dynasty's interactions with North Africa, specifically highlighting Abd al-Rahman III's policies aimed at countering the influence of the Fatimids and extending Umayyad influence along the North African coast. This includes the conquest of Melilla in 927 and Ceuta in 931. It also touches on the later reduction of Umayyad holdings in North Africa and Al-Hakam II's efforts to restore Cordoban hegemony there, indicating ongoing engagement with the region. The source details the political context of the Cordoban Caliphate which emerged as a response to the Abbasid revolution, during which an Umayyad member fled to the Iberian Peninsula and set up an independent emirate, later becoming a Caliphate. This period reflects the zenith of Al-Andalus and the ambitions of the Umayyads beyond the Iberian Peninsula into North Africa. The text covers key figures like Abd al-Rahman III, Al-Hakam II, and Almanzor. It also explores the internal dynamics of Al-Andalus including social stratification, economic prosperity, and the eventual decline of the Caliphate into the Taifa kingdoms.",

The larger work explores the historical relationship between Morocco and Spain. Other chapters within the work suggest a chronological approach covering various periods including a colonial era. Of particular relevance to the Islamic conquest of the Maghreb, the chapter list includes \"La era colonial (I) : marruecos de la tradición : preludio de la conquista\" which translates to \"The Colonial Era (I): Morocco of Tradition: Prelude to the Conquest.\" This suggests at least some coverage of pre-colonial North African history and the context leading up to later conquests or interventions. While the exact contents of \"El vaivén de la historia\" aren't available in this metadata, its inclusion in a work on Moroccan-Spanish history alongside chapters explicitly referencing conquest, makes it likely to contain information relevant to the Umayyad conquest and the broader historical changes it initiated in the region.  It's crucial to access the full text of the chapter to confirm its specific focus, however, the metadata from this book listing suggests a strong potential connection to the early Islamic period in Morocco, which is intrinsically linked to the Umayyad conquests.",

It covers the motivations behind the Arab expansion, the conditions in Visigothic Spain that facilitated the conquest, and the initial stages of the invasion led by Tariq ibn Ziyad following preliminary incursions and reconnaissance missions. The text discusses the weakness of the Visigothic kingdom due to internal divisions, social discontent and the persecution of the Jews, and the role of figures such as Count Julian in aiding the initial invasion.

It examines how Muslims distinguished between Christians living under Islamic rule (dhimmi) and those in the \"dar al-harb\" (territory of war). The text highlights how chronicles describe these groups and the shifting relationships between them, including periods of peace and conflict. It explores the conceptual association of rebellion with altitude and submission with the plain, illustrating how this metaphor is used in describing both Christian and Muladi revolts against Umayyad rule, focusing on terms related to subjugation versus rebellion. The author uses chronicles like Ajbar Machmu'a, Al-Muqtabis by Ibn Hayyan, and others to support the analysis of terminology related to the frontier, Christians, and rebellion during the Umayyad Caliphate of Cordoba.",

It gives a historical overview starting from the Umayyad Emirate established after the initial conquest in 711-756, dependent on the Umayyad Caliphate in Damascus. It discusses the subsequent establishment of the independent Emirate and later Caliphate of Cordoba by Abd al-Rahman I and III, respectively. The text details the fragmentation of the Caliphate into Taifa kingdoms, the Reconquista by Christian kingdoms, the intervention of the Almoravids and Almohads, and the eventual survival of the Nasrid Kingdom of Granada until 1492. It also mentions cultural aspects like the development of Andalusian literature and music, and the interaction between Muslims, Jews, and Christians, mentioning figures like Ibn Hazm and Ziryab. Furthermore, the text introduces the various articles included in the volume, focusing on literature, poetry, and musicological studies in al-Andalus.",

The first explores the origins of the name Al-Andalus and its connection to the Umayyad Caliphate, suggesting it was linked to the Iberian Peninsula since the conquest in the 8th century. This article argues that the name Al-Andalus relates to the direction 'west' and Venus, and is connected to Medina Azahara. The second article analyzes ceremonies at the Royal Palace of Morocco as depicted in the journal Da‘wat al-Ḥaqq, linking it to the splendor of the caliphates and potentially to ceremonies held in Medina Azahara. The text emphasizes the importance of these studies in understanding the cultural and political landscape of Al-Andalus and the Maghreb. It also mentions the research project supporting this work.",

The article focuses on rings found in Christian cemeteries in Pamplona (Argaray and Casa del Condestable), as well as rings from Saratsua and Aldaieta, and compares these to rings found in Muslim cemeteries and other locations in al-Andalus and North Africa. It considers the texts inscribed on the rings, their archaeological context, and osteoarchaeological data to understand the social and religious dynamics of the 8th century, discussing the implications of finding Islamic-influenced artifacts in Christian burials while such artifacts are absent or rare in Muslim burials. It examines the chronology of the rings based on AMS dating and stratigraphic analysis, concluding the rings were primarily from the 8th century, around and after the time of the Islamic conquest of Pamplona. The study ultimately suggests the rings represent a complex interplay between local elites and the new Islamic powers, highlighting the processes of cultural exchange and acculturation in the early stages of al-Andalus.",

The paper challenges solely textual narratives of the conquest, arguing for the importance of archaeological findings in understanding the social and cultural transformations of the period. It examines the archaeological record from the Visigothic period through the Caliphate, highlighting the significance of stratified sequences and material culture in revealing the dynamics of Islamization and Arabization.

It argues that this silence stems from a combination of a lack of historical data available to Eastern authors and a deliberate political strategy to marginalize the rebellious West, which relates to the period after the initial conquests, but provides necessary context to it. The article highlights how Abbasid historiography, centered in Baghdad, tended to view the Islamic West as a distant periphery, a representation that persisted for centuries. The author explains how Eastern sources often ignored key events and figures in the West, such as the establishment of the Umayyad Emirate in al-Andalus by Abd al-Rahman I and the rise of the Idrisid dynasty. The article also explores how Western authors developed counter-narratives to assert their own importance and constructed accounts that highlighted a supposed admiration from the East toward the West. Ultimately, the article concludes that the relative independence of the Islamic West impacted historical writing, with the break in political relations leading to its erasure from the official historical discourse elaborated in the East. Although the article is focused on the Abbasid period, it does touch on the initial conquest and subsequent administration by specifically mentioning the writings about the Futūḥ, or conquests, of the region and the beginning of the Arab presence, providing necessary context about the immediate aftermath.",

Provincialisation et stratégies impériales », which discusses the administration of Tingitana under the Caliphate of Cordoba. The review also points out that the Umayyads maintained geographical conceptions of the dependence of Tingitania on the Iberian Peninsula after the Islamic conquest, suggesting continuity rather than complete rupture. It clarifies that, contrary to Christophe Picard's assertion, there was no 'province of two shores' in the Strait of Gibraltar during the Umayyad period, unlike during the Almohad era, indicating different territorial conceptions and political/cultural contexts related to Islamization and Arabization.",

It examines whether Russadir obtained Roman legal status, utilizing Greco-Latin and medieval Arabic sources, as well as archaeological evidence. The authors conclude that the city likely had Roman legal status since the 1st century BC, but its subsequent evolution remains unclear. The abstract indicates the article's reliance on both literary sources and archaeology to investigate the administrative and legal structures of a city in North Africa, potentially relevant to understanding the context leading up to or influenced by the Umayyad conquest, though it does not directly discuss the conquest itself. The mention of medieval Arabic sources also suggests potential insights into the period following the initial Roman influence.",

The review discusses the book's exploration of the relationships between al-Andalus and the Frankish world from the 8th to the 9th centuries, including the initial Muslim conquests (which began in 711), Frankish responses, the Carolingian expansion into al-Andalus, and attempts at understanding between the two territories. Key events discussed include the Battle of Poitiers (732), the Frankish expedition to Zaragoza in 778, and the establishment of the Marca Hispánica. The review also mentions the phenomenon of the 'hispani' who sought refuge in Frankish lands and the trade and diplomatic relations between al-Andalus and the Frankish kingdoms. The review notes the author's agreement with Pirenne's thesis regarding the initial disruption of trade due to the conquests and battles of the 8th century. It also touches on the limited mutual knowledge between the Franks and Andalusians and the refutation of the \"clash of civilizations\" theory in this period, highlighting agreements between different groups irrespective of religious differences.",

This paper discusses the relationship between Ceuta and the Iberian Peninsula from the 8th to the 13th centuries, focusing on the material evidence, especially ceramics, to understand the exchanges and trade routes that existed during that period. It specifically touches upon the Umayyad conquest, noting Ceuta's role as a link between the Iberian Peninsula and the Maghreb, and how ceramics may help explain the nature of contacts during the arrival of the Muslims in the Iberian Peninsula. The study examines the types of ceramics found on both sides of the Strait of Gibraltar, shedding light on the commercial and cultural connections during the Umayyad period and beyond, examining trade dynamics, influences from North Africa, and the eventual integration of the Garb al-Andalus into Mediterranean trade networks. It details ceramic styles such as the 'olla emiral,' green and purple ceramics from the Caliphate of Cordoba, cuerda seca ceramics, and their dispersion across different regions.

The text emphasizes the continuity of Arab influence in Spain and the reciprocal influence of Spain on the Arab world, even after the Reconquista.
