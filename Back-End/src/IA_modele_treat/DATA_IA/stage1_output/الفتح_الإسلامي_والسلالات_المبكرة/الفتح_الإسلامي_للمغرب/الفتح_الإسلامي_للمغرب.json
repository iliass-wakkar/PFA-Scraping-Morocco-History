It addresses the arguments for and against the traditional narrative of a coordinated Islamic invasion, referencing archaeological evidence, numismatics, and the interpretation of historical sources. The source further explores the underlying methodological and philosophical issues that fuel these debates, comparing them to earlier disputes about medieval Spain and the concept of 'convivencia'. It analyzes the motivations and potential political implications of denying or affirming the Islamic conquest, and it reflects upon the challenges of translating these debates to an Anglophone audience. While centered on Iberia, some entities discussed, such as Musa ibn Nusayr, directly participated in the conquest of both al-Andalus and parts of North Africa (Maghreb). Therefore, the events and actors directly contribute to the broader historical context of \"الفتح الإسلامي للمغرب\", where the conquests of North Africa provided a springboard for expansion into Iberia.",
          "extracted_key_facts": [
            "In 711 CE, Islamic armies conquered the Iberian Peninsula (al-Andalus), a claim that has been subject to scholarly debate.",
            "The debate revolves around the extent to which the conquest was a coordinated invasion versus a series of uncoordinated raids.",
            "Ignacio Olagüe (1903-1974) denied the existence of an Islamic conquest, arguing that Islam arrived later through missionaries.",
            "Olagüe claimed that Tāriq b. Ziyād was a Goth and the mosque of Cordoba was an Arian temple.",
            "Emilio González Ferrín revived Olagüe's thesis, arguing that there was no unified 'Islam' in 711.",
            "González Ferrín contended that Islam emerged in Iberia through a slow process of fusion and confrontation, culminating in the ninth-century invention of 'Islam' as a distinct religious tradition.",
            "Alejandro García Sanjuán rejects González Ferrín's skepticism, citing Arabic and Latin chronicles, as well as numismatic evidence as proof of a coordinated conquest.",
            "García Sanjuán highlights the bilingual, gold solidus of Umayyad governor al-Ḥ urr b. ‘Abd al-Raḥmān al-Thaqafī (r. 716–718) containing part of the shahāda as evidence of early Islamic identity.",
            "García Sanjuán criticizes González Ferrín for distorting facts and for potentially fueling Islamophobia.",
            "The debate reflects fundamental philosophical issues, such as the nature of history as a science versus an interpretive art.",
            "The source connects this debate to earlier disputes between Américo Castro and Claudio Sánchez-Albornoz about Spanish identity and 'convivencia'.",
            "The article mentions Musa ibn Nusayr and Tariq ibn Ziyad, key figures involved in both the conquest of North Africa and the subsequent invasion of Iberia.",
            "The source highlights the importance of numismatic evidence, including coins from as early as 713, in understanding the organization, language, and religious identity of the conquerors.",
            "Material culture evidence, such as ceramics and numismatics, is used to reconstruct the events of the 8th century in the Iberian Peninsula."

It argues that the conquest was not random but based on a well-structured military plan initiated by the Caliphs and governors. The conquest began with initial reconnaissance campaigns, followed by a series of campaigns and wars that lasted approximately seventy years. The study explores the reasons for the removal of governors, procedures following their removal, and the impact of these changes on the region's stability and the continuation of the Islamic conquest. It also highlights the role of Egypt as a base for supervising the conquest and the evolving relationship between the Maghreb and the Islamic Caliphate. Specific governors like Uqba ibn Nafi, Abu al-Muhajir Dinar, Hassan ibn al-Nu'man, and Abdullah ibn Musa ibn Nusair are discussed, focusing on the circumstances surrounding their appointments, actions, and eventual removal from their posts. The source also touches on the Berber revolts and their impact on the political landscape of the Maghreb.",

It uses scant evidence on personal income distribution within the Empire and regional income differences to argue that the Empire was more homogeneous than the EU in terms of regional incomes and that interpersonal inequality was low. The paper also suggests that income inequality around the year 700 was likely less than during Augustus's time, contradicting the view that inequality rose as the Western Roman Empire dissolved. The paper's relevance stems from its analysis of income inequality up to the period of the Islamic Conquest in the Euro-Mediterranean region, thus providing a context that can relate to the societal and economic impact of the Islamic expansion.",

It highlights that the creation of the Maghreb script can be traced back to the Islamic invasion of the Maghreb, and its subsequent evolution under various sultans. The research uses a qualitative descriptive study and a library research design. It identifies differences between the Maghreb Mushaf and other Al-Quran editions, focusing on script and pronunciation. The article also emphasizes the importance of preserving and digitizing Maghreb manuscripts for academic and research purposes. It argues that reading the Koran using a traditional mushaf is a way of preserving culture and following the guidance of the Prophet Muhammad.",

The study uses genetic markers, including Y-chromosome and mitochondrial DNA, to determine the origin and age of this mutation. The findings suggest that the G2019S mutation likely originated in a Berber founder in the Maghreb around 5000 years ago and that the Arab conquest of the 7th century had a cultural, rather than a complete demographic, impact on the Berber population. While the primary focus is on genetics and the origin of the G2019S mutation and Parkinson's Disease, the study explicitly addresses the Arabic conquests/influence on the Berber population of North Africa as part of its historical and genetic analysis, including dating the arrival of Arabic cultural influence at ~1300 years ago.",

The individual was buried in Segorbe, near Valencia, Spain. The analysis of the individual's genome, along with stable isotope data from other individuals from the same necropolis, reveals a complex picture of admixture between North African (Berber) populations and the existing Iberian population following the Islamic conquest of Iberia in 711 CE. The study suggests the individual's ancestry reflects a relatively recent admixture of Berber and Iberian lineages, and that he likely grew up in the Segorbe region. It explores the complex genetic dynamics that followed the Islamic conquest, including the influx of Arabs and Berbers, and subsequent demographic shifts like the expulsion of Moriscos in the 17th century CE, which significantly altered the genetic landscape of the region.",

It focuses on the analysis of an individual, dubbed the \"Segorbe Giant,\" buried in an Islamic necropolis in Segorbe, Spain. The study uses ancient DNA analysis, stable isotope analysis, and examination of mitochondrial DNA to investigate the genetic impact of the Islamic conquest of Iberia in 711 CE and subsequent population movements, particularly involving Amazigh (Berber) and Arab peoples. The findings suggest that the Segorbe Giant's ancestry resulted from admixture between recently arrived Amazigh people and the pre-Islamic Iberian population. The report also discusses the genetic landscape of medieval Iberia, including the influence of the Umayyad Caliphate, the Almoravid and Almohad Berber empires, and the expulsion of Moriscos in the 17th century CE. The study highlights the importance of immigration from North Africa during the Islamic period and the complex demographic dynamics of East Iberia.

While it does not directly narrate the military campaigns of the \"الفتح الإسلامي للمغرب\", it establishes the historical context and societal changes that followed the Islamic conquests in general, which is relevant. The text highlights how the conquests led to the growth of cities and how Jewish communities adapted and transformed within these newly urbanized environments under Islamic rule. It also discusses the Pact of 'Umar, which was the set of rules and regulations imposed upon conquered peoples. The text also provides specific examples of Jews being moved into coastal towns after the conquests. It explains the social and economic transformations of Jewish communities, from agrarian societies to urban commercial ones, and their roles in the Islamic cities, including their legal and communal adaptations. It highlights the shift from an agrarian society to a cosmopolitan one, especially in cities, and discusses the relationship between Muslims, Jews, and Christians in these urban settings.",

            "People from different regions, including some Arabs, were settled in reconstructed towns along the Levantine coast, including Acre and Tyre.",
            "Arabs began filtering into pre-existing towns, while Jews, Christians, and Zoroastrians began moving into the amsar as travel restrictions eased.",

            "By the 10th century, Jews had transformed into an overwhelmingly urban group with a high degree of communal organization.",
            "The Islamic city was not a corporation to which people belonged, but rather a place where people lived.",

            "In the 10th and 11th centuries, many Jews had entered the mercantile and professional ranks.",
            "At the close of the Middle Ages, the Jews in many Islamic urban centers began to enjoy a brief cultural and economic revival with the influx of Sephardi refugees expelled from Spain, Portugal, and Sicily."

The article discusses the roles of Amr ibn al-Aas and Abdullah ibn Saad ibn Abi al-Sarh in the Islamic conquest of North Africa. It states that Amr ibn al-Aas, after conquering Egypt, aimed to secure its western borders and expand into the Maghreb. He conquered Barqa, Tripoli, and Zawila, incorporating them into the Islamic state. The article also mentions that Abdullah ibn Saad ibn Abi al-Sarh, who succeeded Amr as governor of Egypt, continued the same policy, dispatching raiding parties into Africa. Abdullah ibn Saad later gained the Caliph's permission to advance the conquest, leading to the victory at Sbeitla, the capture of the Byzantine fortress, the death of their leader, Geregorio (or Jirjir), the acquisition of spoils, and the imposition of Jizya.

It argues that the political stability in the Maghreb in general, and Ifriqiya in particular, after the spread of Islam contributed to the prosperity of economic activities, especially trade. Most cities and regions were connected through a network of important trade routes, with some cities and regions being exceptionally important as they were meeting points for land trade caravan routes and links between different cities and countries. This gave them strategic and economic importance and made them cultural centers at various political, economic, social, and cultural levels. The paper focuses on the trade relations between Fezzan and Jebel Nafusa, considering Fezzan as a link between Sudan and Jebel Nafusa and connecting Fezzan to the cities and ports of Ifriqiya and others in a continuous complementary relationship.",

The research examines the impact of political, social, cultural, and linguistic factors on shaping the names of population groups. It also tracks the transformations in the nomenclature of social groups in North Africa, noting that many historical studies have simply passed on lists of these groups without delving into their historical origins and ethnonymic meanings or considering the temporal contexts contributing to their formation. The study aims to clarify the composition of the social structure in Morocco from the beginning of the Islamic conquest until the end of the Almohad era, focusing on local and incoming groups, nomadic and urban, settled and mobile. It seeks to map out patterns of human settlement and identify the spatial distribution of indigenous populations, ancient communities, and new groups in Islamic Morocco. Furthermore, it aims to reveal the nature of population classifications, human divisions, and name changes that affected the ethnic composition of North Africa by bridging the time gaps between the ancient and medieval eras. The study investigates the role of Islamization and Arabization in the name transformations of human groups following the Islamic conquests in the Maghreb.",

The abstract explicitly mentions the importance of gold in Morocco, particularly after the Islamic conquest of Morocco in 21 AH (642 AD). It discusses how the political, social, and economic stability that followed the conquest led to the widespread use of gold. The article notes that due to the limited availability of gold in Morocco, the caliphs and princes had to import it from neighboring countries, especially Sudan, which was renowned for its pure gold.

The research focuses on political events, practices, cultural heritage, economic and social conditions conveyed from Egypt to the Islamic West, as reflected in their collective consciousness. It also addresses the scientific presence of Egyptians, including individuals, sciences, and culture, and their impact on the scientific and cultural landscape of the Islamic West. Furthermore, it examines architectural influences and artistic elements originating from Egypt that were adopted in the Islamic West, as recorded in the writings of authors from the region. The study excludes writings of travelers and geographers who visited Egypt for religious, scientific, or commercial reasons, focusing solely on the tangible and intangible presence of Egypt and Egyptians documented by authors of the Islamic West. \n\nThe research starts with the political life, mentioning the main political events that affected Egypt until the end of the Ayyubid era, the period in which historical writing about Egypt's political events and reality ceased in the writings of Western historians. It follows the political role of Egyptians since the Arab conquest of the Maghreb and Andalusia, including the participation of Egyptian soldiers in the conquest movement, as well as their role in the political opposition in Andalusia (specifically during the era of Abd al-Rahman al-Dakhil), and then presents important Egyptian figures who emerged in the fields of governance, administration, and the military. \n\nThe economic aspect addresses the quality of Egyptian goods through comparisons with goods from the Islamic West, demonstrating how these products became benchmarks for quality in the global market. It also covers the use of the Egyptian (Coptic) calendar by the Moroccans and Andalusians in their agricultural practices alongside the Gregorian calendar, as well as trade exchanges. It further examines economic customs in Egyptian markets related to specific goods and how they were adopted by jurists in Morocco and Andalusia, eventually being implemented in their markets. The movement of Egyptian traders in the Maghreb and Andalusia is discussed, along with a comparison of prices and weights in Egyptian ports (Alexandria) with some Moroccan ports and the value of Egyptian currency compared to currencies circulating in the Islamic West, illustrating the economic levels between them. \n\nThe social aspect includes Egyptian dietary habits, such as foods known in the Maghreb and Andalusia, Egyptian customs in marriage and childbirth, the epidemics that struck Egypt, in which Moroccan scholars and physicians participated in confronting, and popular proverbs about Egyptians. It also covers the significance of the Nile River in the collective consciousness of the Islamic West, its comparison to cities and rivers, and the ethics and traits of Egyptians as depicted in literary works. The final aspect concerns the architectural presence, tracing some Egyptian influences in architecture and arts, such as the existence of Egyptian-style buildings and the presence of place names with Egyptian connotations, such as \"Pharaoh's Palace\" in Morocco, \"Pharaoh's Morsel\" in Andalusia, and \"Alexandrian Mosque\" in Cordoba, as well as some art with Egyptian influence.

It discusses the history of the Maghreb before and after the Islamic conquest, identifies prominent Amazigh scholars, and explores their contributions to preparing preachers, addressing theological and legal matters, and advocating for ethical conduct. The study identifies the unique characteristics of the Amazigh scholars' advocacy methods, explores the benefits of their approach, and emphasizes the voluntary adoption of Islam by the Amazigh people. It highlights the establishment of mosques, schools, and scholarly institutions, as well as the role of Islamic endowments, particularly the University of Al-Qarawiyyin, in supporting religious education and training preachers. The paper also explores the Amazigh scholars' involvement in codifying Islamic law according to the Maliki school of thought and their emphasis on Sufism, which advocates for noble morals and connects individuals with God. Furthermore, it discusses the means and methods employed by Amazigh scholars in spreading Islam, including writing books, utilizing mosques and Sufi lodges, and undertaking scholarly journeys. It concludes by highlighting key findings, such as the long and difficult Islamic conquest of the Maghreb, the widespread adoption of Islam by the Amazigh people, and the significant contributions of Amazigh scholars to Islamic sciences and Sufism.",

It relies heavily on Ibn 'Idhari al-Marrakushi's \"Al-Bayan al-Mughrib fi Akhbar al-Andalus wa'l-Maghrib\" as a primary source. The paper explores administrative roles like the ministry (al-Wizarah), the judiciary (al-Qada), the chamberlainship (al-Hijabah), the police (al-Shurta), and the Diwans (governmental departments). The study analyzes how these systems, often originating from the Orient, were implemented and evolved in the Maghreb from the Islamic conquest in the early first Hijri century onward. It examines the combination of administrative roles, the use of multiple individuals in the same position, and the overall administrative structure of the region as reflected in Ibn 'Idhari's work. It covers administrative practices and appointments in the Maghreb from the early Islamic period through later dynasties, citing specific examples and figures. The paper also addresses issues of justice, taxation, and the role of different officials in maintaining order and governance, drawing on historical accounts and biographical details found within Al-Bayan al-Mughrib.",

However, the abstract notes that the 'Sheikhs of the Raiders' (Shuyukh al-Guzat), the Mujahideen who strived to support Islam, did not receive much attention, except in references related to Granada. The research aims to shed light on the role of these Mujahideen Sheikhs during a critical period in the history of Islamic Al-Andalus. The study highlights their role in Jihad, motivated by the belief that Jihad is an obligation for every Muslim. These Sheikhs and their volunteer groups engaged in Jihad alongside the regular army to defend the lands of Islam and Muslims.

It examines how French historians and intellectuals distorted Algerian and North African history to legitimize colonial rule, including minimizing pre-Islamic and Islamic contributions, and promoting Berber identity over Arab identity to undermine unity. Critically, it mentions how the French viewed the Islamic conquest (الفتح الإسلامي للمغرب) as a negative event that did not benefit the Maghreb. The paper then explores the Algerian response to this historical revisionism, focusing on the efforts of Algerian intellectuals, particularly within the الإصلاحية (reformist) movement and the استقلالي (independence) movement. These Algerian figures sought to rewrite Algerian history, emphasizing its Arab and Islamic heritage, celebrating the region's historical figures, and promoting a unified Maghreb identity as part of a broader Arab-Islamic world. Specific figures like Ahmed Tewfik al-Madani and Muhammad ibn Mubarak al-Mili are highlighted for their historical writings and their role in countering French narratives. It also describes some French reactions to this Algerian historical movement, noting efforts to suppress and censor Algerian historical works. Although the main focus is on the French colonial period, it also contains information about the Islamic conquest and its legacy in Algeria.",

The article emphasizes the importance of studying Ibadi manuscripts, specifically those within the al-Bāsī library, to understand the history of the library itself and the family's relationship with the Ibadiyya. It highlights how these manuscripts shed light on the exchange of knowledge within the island environment of Djerba and its connections to neighboring regions, including cultural interactions between the Ibadi community of Djerba and other communities in the Maghreb and the Mashreq, demonstrating deep Maghrebi and Mediterranean connections. The digitization project of the al-Bāsī library has uncovered a collection of Ibadi manuscripts displaying interactions between the Ibadiyya of Djerba and other centers of learning and knowledge. The abstract emphasizes the significance of figures like الحاج سالم وعثمان (al-Hajj Salem and Othman) in establishing the library and the care taken in acquiring, copying, binding, and preserving manuscripts, which reveal the diversity of the collection's sources.",

For example, it mentions \"الفتوحات الإسلامية\" (Islamic conquests) in a general sense when listing the expected outcomes of studying a unit on Islamic history, and mentions the role of \"الكاهنة\", leader of the Jarawa tribe in Awrash, as one of the obstacles faced during the Arab conquests of North Africa, pinpointing her death to 82 AH/701 AD.

However, a specific section of one paper (titled \"MÂVERÂÜNNEHİR’İN FETHİ VE EMEVİLER DÖNEMİ MÂVERÂÜNNEHİR\") discusses the initial Muslim conquests of Transoxiana, which falls under the category of Islamic conquests, similar to the Islamic conquest of the Maghreb. Therefore, it warrants a 'relevant' categorization as it explores the expansion of Islamic rule and influence, which is a key element in discussions of Islamic conquests in general. A further paper titled 'أﺛﺮ اﻟﻄﺮق اﻟﺼﻮﻓﻴﺔ ﰲ ﻧﺸﺮ اﻹﺳﻼم ﰲ ﺑﻼد ﻣﺎ وراء اﻟﻨﻬﺮ' discusses the role of Sufi orders in spreading Islam in the region of Transoxiana, which relates to the spread of Islam in newly conquered lands, which is a relevant topic.",

It examines the archaeological evidence of irrigation networks and their connection to social organization, land use, and territorial control during the Middle Ages. The study considers the different scales of water sharing, from inter-community agreements to individual initiatives using technologies like norias. Specific locations such as Nakūr, Aġmāt, and Tāmdult in Morocco are analyzed, along with regions in al-Andalus like the Vega de Grenade and the Alpujarra in Almería. The article argues that irrigation systems reflect the social structures and power dynamics established after the Arab-Islamic conquest, showing how water management and land organization became interconnected processes. It also explores the role of the state and tribal organization in shaping these systems.",

While the main focus is on Korea-Morocco relations, the abstract provides a brief historical overview of Morocco. It mentions that Morocco, situated in northwest Africa, has been a crossroads of civilizations and a land of cohabitation based on dialogue and tolerance. Throughout its history, Morocco has been subject to several invasions, starting with the Berbers (2000 BC), Phoenicians (1100 BC), Carthaginians, Romans, Vandals, and Byzantines. In 647, Muslims made their first reconnaissance voyage to Morocco, but it was only in 708 that Islamization and the birth of the Moroccan nation began, leading to the conquest of Spain starting in 711. The abstract further mentions the reigns of various dynasties from the 8th to the 17th centuries, including the Idrissids (686-917), Almoravids, Almohads, Mirinids, Saadians, and finally the Alaouite dynasty, which has been ruling since 1660.",

The article also mentions the hérésie of the Berghwata in the 9th century, a movement that formed a Berber kingdom and adopted a Coran written in Berber. The Berber's adaptation and integration of Islam after its arrival in the 8th century are discussed, highlighting a historical interplay between Berber culture and the Islamic religion. Overall, this academic paper examines the political and cultural factors driving the selection of different scripts to transcribe Berber languages, highlighting the tensions between Berber identity, Islam, and Arab cultural dominance.

The Fatwās of Ibn Rushd al-Jadd to the Far Maghrib.\" The review discusses how the book explores the legal manifestations of Islamization in the Maghreb Extrême during the Almoravid period (roughly from the mid-11th century). The review summarizes the book's arguments about the role of the Almoravids in promoting Maliki orthodoxy, the interaction between legal norms and social practices as reflected in the fatwas of Ibn Rushd (1058-1126), and the connection between urbanization and the spread of Maliki law. The review also presents a critical assessment of the book's methodology and findings, pointing out perceived weaknesses in its treatment of the concept of Islamization, its analysis of pre-Almoravid Maliki presence, and its emphasis on urbanization as the primary driver of Islamization. It further delves into specific examples from the book's chapters on Marrakech, the rest of the Maghrib al-Aqṣā, and Ceuta, highlighting the diversity of legal issues addressed in Ibn Rushd's fatwas, including economic disputes, ritual purification, apostasy, Ash'arite theology, and property rights. The review mentions Qāḍī ‘Iyāḍ's correspondence with Ibn Rushd regarding water resource management in Ceuta and also covers the book's appendices: a table of legal consultations and English translations of the fatwas studied.",

Un empire de l’Afrique à l’Espagne' held at the Musée du Louvre from October 17, 2014, to January 19, 2015. The review discusses how the exhibition aimed to revisit a long-overlooked past and highlights the interrelations between the Maghreb and Spain during the medieval period. It notes that the expansion of Islam in the north of the Maghreb and the south of Spain was driven by Berbers. It points out the political and religious conflicts between the Maghreb and Spain from the mid-8th century to the 15th century. The reviewer finds the catalogue a valuable resource for understanding the history of the Western Mediterranean during the Middle Ages, particularly the political and religious history of the Maghreb and al-Andalus. The review also mentions the importance of understanding the Berber role in the expansion of Islam, and their acquisition of Arab culture in coastal regions, which led to the union of the two territories of Maghreb and al-Andalus.",

It begins by defining the geographical area known as the Maghreb and discussing sources for the period. It then examines the Berber social structure on the eve of the Arab conquests, including the divisions between Butr and Barani tribes and important Berber confederations like Zanata, Awraba, and Sanhadja. The text describes the initial phases of the conquest, starting with the capture of Cyrenaica and Tripolitania, followed by incursions into Byzacena. The second phase involves figures like Uqba ibn Nafi, the founding of Kairouan, and Berber conversion to Islam. It then details the rise of Berber resistance, the role of Kusayla, and the campaigns of Hassan ibn al-Nu'man against the Kahina. Finally, it covers the conquest of the western Maghreb by Musa ibn Nusayr, leading to the invasion of the Iberian Peninsula. It also explores the social and religious transformation of the Berbers after the conquest, including their conversion to Islam, Arabization, and eventual revolts against Umayyad rule.",

It synthesizes archaeobotanical findings (seeds, fruits, wood) from ten Moroccan sites, mainly in the north, with two sites in the south (Sijilmasa and Îgîlîz). The study examines plant remains from various contexts, including garbage dumps, storage areas, and hearths. The document identifies 44 cultivated plant species and approximately 150 wild taxa, providing a diachronic view of agro-alimentary changes. The study also discusses the difficulties in interpreting archaeobotanical data, factors affecting seed preservation, and the integration of wild plants into diets. Specific attention is given to plant remains from Islamic period sites like al-Basra, Sijilmasa, Qsar es-Seghir and Îgîlîz, contrasting them with findings from earlier periods and other geographical areas. The document concludes by emphasizing the need for further research and a more balanced distribution of archaeobotanical information and highlights the role of vegetables and fruits in the diet of the populations in both the north and south of Morocco, with a special emphasis on the Islamic period.",

It examines the plurality of the Tijaniyya, its local adaptations, and the relationships between Tijani leaders in Senegal and Morocco. The article explores the historical context of the Tijaniyya's introduction to Senegal by El Hadj Umar Tall in the 19th century and the establishment of important maraboutic families like the Sy of Tivaouane and the Niasse of Kaolack. It analyzes the role of the Tijaniyya in Senegalese society, its interaction with French colonialism, and its contemporary dynamics, including the rise of \"neo-confrérisme\" exemplified by the Moustarchidine movement. The article also investigates the historical links between Morocco and Senegal through the Tijaniyya, highlighting the city of Fes as a center of pilgrimage and spiritual renewal for Senegalese Tijanis. It addresses the complex and sometimes competitive relationships between Tijani leaders in Morocco and Senegal, shaped by issues of legitimacy, authority, and differing views on religious practices. The piece includes analysis of differing views amongst Moroccan and Senegalese Tijaniyya leaders regarding orthodoxy and practice. While not directly about the initial Arab conquest, the article is relevant due to its discussion of the historical and contemporary religious landscape of Morocco and Senegal, specifically the Tijaniyya order's influence, originating in the Maghreb.",

It highlights the role of Sufism in the empires of Mali and Niger from the 11th century onwards, its spread through trade and preachers from North Africa (including the impact of the Almoravids), and the subsequent establishment of theocratic states in the Senegal River valley by the Fulani and Toucouleur populations in the 18th and 19th centuries. The text also emphasizes the importance of the Maliki rite in fostering links between the Maghreb and Sub-Saharan Africa.  It details the rise of Sufi brotherhoods (turuq), especially the Qadiriyya and Tidjaniyya, and their role in the mass conversion of populations in the 19th century. The text further analyzes the Tidjaniyya's spread from Algeria and Morocco through West Africa, propelled by El Hadj Umar Tall's jihad. It also mentions the Mouridiyya, a uniquely Senegalese Sufi order founded by Ahmadou Bamba Mbacké (1853-1927), and its significant economic, social, and political impact, as well as its influence tied to the colonial era. The analysis includes the discussion of contemporary trends in West African Sufism, including internal reforms, the emergence of new religious figures, and the increasing involvement of Sufi leaders in social, political, and economic affairs, particularly in Senegal and Mali. It concludes that Sufism maintains its strength through engagement with social and political changes, while navigating the landscape of competing religious offers and internal rivalries.",

It reconstructs the settlement process in Figuig and highlights the connection between the settlement, water-sharing methods, and social codes. The water distribution system was based on a complex network fed by drainage galleries and springs, featuring multiple saqiya-s and storage pools. Sharing relied on time and volume measurements. Water rights were generally private property and could be transmitted like real estate. Customary easements supplemented irrigation rights. The article also touches on the population of Figuig, including Zenete, Sanhaja, and Hilalian tribes, and Idrissid sharifs. The period from the 6th/12th to the 8th/14th centuries is mentioned in relation to the arrival of different groups and their interactions.",

            "Later, other Zenete groups, the Ūlād Ṣallām and Udārna, built Tawsārt (present-day qaṣr Oulad Slimane), and the Ūlād Ǧarrār came from Siǧilmāssa to settle in the current qaṣr Loudaghir.",

Un enjeu politique mérinide ?\" by Abdessamad Dialmy, published in 1998, examines obstetrical rites in Morocco, specifically focusing on the 'spreading of the sheet' rite practiced in Fes from the 13th century to the 1950s. The study explores the rite's origins in the social, religious, and political history of the city during the Middle Ages. The article discusses the anthropological form of the rite and the condemnation of the ritual by the oulema for socio-economic reasons. It analyzes the functions of the rite within the city, distinguishing between an obstetrical function and a latent function of Islamic urban integration. Furthermore, the article introduces the 'Trousers rite' as a competitor, suggesting its latent function was to provide the Merinides with religious legitimacy. The study proposes a battle between the two rites, posing questions about the relationship between political power and civil society.",

The thesis examines the structures of the Islamized empires of the western Sudan (Mali, Songhay) and the animist Mossi empire, noting their similarities and originality compared to Arab-Muslim civilization, except for the limited emergence of Muslim scholars in Mali and their greater presence in Songhay. The thesis also states that the relationship between these empires and the Mediterranean basin represents an Islamic penetration of the Sudan in economic, human, religious, scientific, and literary terms, leading to the development of an Islamico-Negro civilization on the banks of the Niger River. Sudanese products like gold and slaves enriched both Muslim and Christian Mediterranean regions (Italy, southern France, Spain, Portugal). The economic policies of these empires to break the Maghreb's monopoly from the 14th century, and Portuguese economic intervention on the Atlantic and Guinean coasts in the 15th and 16th centuries, led to an economic and gold crisis in Morocco. These economic factors contributed to the Moroccan conquest of Songhay in 1591. The combined impact of these factors, including the slave trade towards Mediterranean countries, led to the collapse of the old Sudanese empires and the subsequent decline of the western Sudan after the Moroccan conquest of the Songhay empire.",

It also notes that around this time, the core of the Tuaregs of Adrar was already forming. The entry further elaborates on the history of the region, discussing the competition between Berbers and Songhai, the importance of Tademekkat as a trade center, and later migrations and conflicts. It discusses the story of Koseilata and Oqba ben Naffa, detailing the early interactions and resistance during the Islamic expansion. It covers the political structure, trade, and eventual French colonization of the region. The article also points to the importance of Ibn Khaldoun's accounts regarding the political situation at the time of the Islamic conquest, specifically noting the revolt of Koceila against the invaders in 675 and his subsequent actions.",

It mentions the successive migrations of Berber populations into the area, including the Lemta and Hoouara. Crucially, it directly references the Islamic conquest (الفتح الإسلامي) in the late 7th century, stating a second wave of migration from Tripolitania southward occurred at that time, with some remaining in the Adrar and others continuing to the Niger River. It details the interactions between Berber groups like the Touareg and the Songhai, highlighting the importance of Tademekkat as a trade center. The text also discusses the revolt of Koceila against the Islamic forces and his subsequent governance of Ifriqiya, events pertinent to the broader context of the Islamic expansion in North Africa. It touches on various historical periods, including the expansion of the Songhai, conflicts among Berber groups, and later, French colonization. It explores themes of trade, nomadism, and the cultural interactions within the Adrar des Iforas region and also mentions the oral traditions surrounding the initial islamic presence.",

            "The nucleus of the Touareg in the Adrar was likely established by this period (late 7th century).",

It details his role as an intermediary between the Spanish crown and the Moroccan sultans, particularly 'Abd al-Malik and Ahmad al-Mansur. The document traces Marin's involvement in negotiations regarding alliances and the potential cession of Larache to Spain. It highlights specific instances of his diplomatic activity, including his role as an interpreter, messenger, and negotiator. The text also mentions other key figures, such as Pedro Venegas de Cordoba, and explores the complexities of Spanish-Moroccan relations during this period, including the involvement of other European powers like England and the Ottoman Empire. The document further elaborates on Marin's interactions with Moroccan nobles, his knowledge of Arabic and Muslim customs, and the challenges he faced in achieving Spain's objectives.",

            "Diego Marin had a nephew with the same name who also served in missions to Morocco.",
            "Ahmad al-Mansur requested that the younger Diego Marin remain in Morocco to refine his diplomatic skills.",
            "In 1588, after news of the Spanish Armada's defeat reached Marrakesh, merchants celebrated, leading to a confrontation in which Diego Marin killed several people and was later imprisoned.",

It examines the city's history, including its mention by Arab geographers and European commercial documents before the Spanish occupation. The article focuses on the Spanish conquest of Cazaza in 1506 by Mariano de Rivera under the Duke of Medina Sidonia, its role as a Spanish military outpost, and its eventual loss to Moroccan forces in 1533 due to internal strife within the Spanish garrison. The article also discusses the inaccurate location of Cazaza in historical accounts and its actual location west of Melilla. It details archaeological findings, including remains from pre-historic, Punic, and Roman periods, as well as descriptions of the city's port, madina (Islamic city), and alcazaba (citadel). The article makes use of previously unused documentation to provide additional insights into the city's history and the Spanish presence there.",

While the text does not directly focus on the military campaigns of the Islamic conquest of the Maghreb (الفتح الإسلامي للمغرب), it addresses the broader context of the Arabic language's spread and diversification following the initial Islamic expansion, touching on the Arabization process in North Africa and the influence of Arabic on Berber languages, making it relevant to understanding the linguistic aspects of the aftermath of the conquest.",

            "The spread of Arabic was not solely due to the expansion of Islam but also required the migration of Arabic speakers and interaction with local populations.",

            "Some regions, like Persia and parts of Central Asia, were Islamized but did not adopt Arabic as a primary language of communication due to a lack of substantial Arab migration.",
            "Mountainous regions in North Africa (Algeria and Morocco) retained Berber languages despite Islamization, although modern states have promoted Arabic through education.",
            "The formation of vernacular Arabic varieties was influenced by the origin of Arab troops in each region, linguistic substrata (e.g., Berber in North Africa), adstrata (languages of interaction), and the superstratum (influence of classical Arabic).",
            "In the Maghreb, Berber languages influenced Arabic dialects, for example, the treatment of some singular Arabic nouns as plurals in Northern Morocco.",
            "Arabic dialects are classified based on diachronic (chronological evolution), diatopic (geographical differences), and diastratic (social stratification) criteria.",
            "A key diatopic division is between Eastern and Western (Maghrebi) Arabic dialects, with differences in phonetics, morphology, syntax, and lexicon.",

            "The Banu Hilal and Banu Ma'qil migrations brought Bedouin dialects to the Maghreb starting in the 11th century.",
            "Arabic dialects spoken outside the Arab world due to older migrations are called 'peripheral Arabic dialects,' while those resulting from recent migrations are called 'Arabic dialects in the diaspora.'",

It traces the origins of this theme to Cervantes' works and examines its evolution and usage in various Spanish texts, including autobiographies, fictionalized accounts, and press reports. The article discusses the historical context of Spanish-Moroccan relations, the phenomenon of Spanish renegades in North Africa, and the representation of Muslim women in Spanish literature, particularly in relation to captivity and religious conversion. Several works and authors are cited, including León López y Espila's 'Los Cristianos de Calomarde,' and Manuel Juan Diana's 'Un prisionero en el Riff,' to show that Spanish literature portrays encounters between cultures and religions during times that partially overlap with the Islamic conquest. The recurring motif reveals underlying power dynamics and colonial undertones in Spanish perceptions of Morocco.",

Although it does not deal directly with the initial Islamic conquest (الفتح الإسلامي للمغرب), it references the reconstruction of Tetouan by Sidi 'Ali Al-Mandari, a Granadan immigrant, under the protection of Sidi 'Ali Ibn Rasid, highlighting the city's role as a refuge after the fall of Granada and its significance as a nexus of Andalusian culture in Morocco. The text details various professions held by women, including those related to textiles, hygiene, midwifery, cooking, and music, and emphasizes the strong Andalusian influence on Tetouan's social structure and customs. The article points out that the influx of Andalusians and Moriscos after the Reconquista significantly shaped Tetouan’s identity. The text includes details on the role of women in Tetouan’s society and government, mentioning Sit Al-Hurra, who co-governed the city, and references Sidi Ahmad Al-Rhuni's writings from the late 19th and early 20th centuries describing female professions in Tetouan, emphasizing the city's flourishing silk industry, the role of women in textile production, and other trades.",

It emphasizes the historical context of this concept, particularly its role in the expansion of Islam and the justification for territorial claims, like Al Andalus, based on past Islamic rule. The text also explores the philosophical underpinnings of Jihad, linking it to Averroes' interpretation of Aristotelian thought and the idea of a universal understanding that justifies the suppression of non-Islamic beliefs. It connects these historical and philosophical aspects to contemporary issues, such as Islamic radicalism and the concept of reclaiming lost Islamic territories. The review also mentions the early battles of Islam in the Iberian Peninsula, noting that even in 718, Muslims viewed their opponents as polytheists during the battle of Covadonga and it also references the initial expansion under the prophet Muhammad.",

          "source_summary": "This paper analyzes the conceptual history of the term 'Sharia' in the Iberian Peninsula over eight centuries, from the 13th century to the present. It examines documents, historical works, and lexicographical works, primarily in Spanish, tracing the evolution of the term from its initial appearance in Mudejar texts ('xara é çumna') to its eventual inclusion in the Diccionario de la Lengua Española in 2017. The study considers the impact of the Christian conquest, the situation of the Mudejars and Moriscos, the role of Spanish missionaries, and the influence of colonialism and globalization on the understanding and usage of 'Sharia'. The research shows how the concept of Sharia has functioned as a bridge of meanings, reflecting the history of Spain and its interactions with Islam. The study also discusses the transformations in the meaning and usage of 'Sharia' due to social and political changes, including the forced conversion and expulsion of Moriscos, and the more recent impact of immigration and the institutionalization of Islam in Spain. The study covers the presence and evolution of related terms like 'Sunna' and their interactions with 'Sharia'.",

While primarily concerned with contemporary issues, it briefly references the historical presence of Muslims in Europe, specifically mentioning the Muslim conquest of the Iberian Peninsula starting in 711 and the establishment of caliphates and emirates there for over seven centuries. It also mentions the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople in 1453 and the subsequent control of the Balkans. The article argues that the current Muslim population in Europe is largely due to post-WWII migration for labor and later, family reunification, distinguishing this from the earlier Muslim presence in regions like Bosnia, Albania, and Kosovo. The article highlights the challenges of integrating Muslim immigrants, the rise of anti-immigrant sentiment, and the complex factors contributing to radicalization among some European Muslims. It concludes by urging European countries to foster integration and for Muslims to demonstrate loyalty to their new homelands.",

It argues that Jewish epigraphy from the 6th to 8th centuries provides a different perspective, showing a continuity of Jewish life and public expression of their religion in Visigothic territories. The article analyzes several inscriptions, including the trilingual inscription of Melliosa from Tortosa, the bilingual inscription of the didascali from Tarragona, and the inscription of Paragorus from Narbonne, to demonstrate this continuity. It also discusses inscriptions from Mauritania Tingitana, such as those from Volubilis. The article critiques the reliance on documentary sources like the Councils of Toledo and the Liber Iudiciorum, suggesting they provide a biased view shaped by the Church's perception of Judaism and the political agendas of Visigothic kings. The article further explores the social status and communal organization of Jewish communities by analysing funerary inscriptions. It concludes that epigraphic evidence reveals a public expression of Jewish identity that contradicts the narrative of complete destruction. The analysis of these inscriptions sheds light on Jewish life and interaction with the broader Hispano-Roman and Visigothic society before, during, and after the Islamic conquest.",
