          "source_summary": "This paper examines the adaptation of the Portuguese garrison in Ceuta after the city's conquest in 1415, focusing on the crucial role of horses in their military operations. It highlights the challenges the garrison faced in adapting to a different type of warfare and terrain, and how horses became essential for reconnaissance, raiding, and defense. The study covers the period from 1415 to 1458, from the initial conquest to the conquest of Alcácer-Ceguer, and analyzes the garrison's use of horses in defensive operations, reconnaissance, and offensive expeditions. It also discusses how the garrison acquired horses through raiding, looting, and foreign markets, emphasizing the importance of the 'Casa de Ceuta' in Lisbon for supplying the fortress. The paper refers to chronicles of the city's commanders, D. Pedro de Meneses and D. Duarte de Meneses, as primary sources, and mentions the significant sieges of 1418 and 1419, along with various skirmishes and expeditions undertaken by the Portuguese garrison. The article emphasizes the initial difficulties the Portuguese faced due to limited cavalry and the gradual strengthening of their cavalry corps, leading to more effective offensive capabilities and a wider area of influence around Ceuta. The significance of the horse is highlighted by the fact that horse casualties were routinely noted in chronicles alongside those of soldiers.",

          "source_summary": "This conference paper abstract discusses the impact of colonial history on urban morphology in Atlantic Northern Africa, focusing on Ceuta, Tangier, and El Jadida. It examines how political changes, particularly the transitions between Muslim and Christian rule, have shaped these cities. Specifically regarding Ceuta, the abstract mentions that it was an important Muslim commercial city that experienced downsizing after its conquest by the Portuguese in 1415 due to sustainability issues. The city remained confined within certain limits for over two centuries until the Spanish took over in 1640. After resisting a siege by Muley Ismail, Ceuta expanded beyond its walls, reoccupying ancient Islamic domains. Tangier is described as a city where Muslim rule was interrupted, particularly during the Portuguese occupation between 1471 and 1661, resulting in a reduction of its perimeter and redirection towards the port. El Jadida is presented as a case with a non-Muslim origin (Portuguese foundation) later subverted by Muslim occupation. The paper aims to analyze the urban strata of these cities to highlight continuities and ruptures between Muslim and Christian influences, using historical cartography and new drawings.",

It highlights the initial conquest of Ceuta by Portugal in 1415, marking the beginning of Portuguese overseas expansion in North Africa. The paper then compares and contrasts the Portuguese influence on Ceuta with their impact on Tangier and El Jadida. It mentions how the Portuguese reduced Ceuta's perimeter for better defense, leading to a significant alteration of the city's structure. It also explores the long siege imposed on Ceuta by Muley Ismail after the Spanish took over in 1640. The paper details how the urban fabric of Ceuta has been transformed over time, including the recovery of its medieval area, now populated by Moroccan emigrants. The paper concludes by contrasting the different urban processes in Ceuta, Tangier, and El Jadida, highlighting the lasting influence of the Portuguese, as well as later British and Spanish, on these North African cities. It asserts that political and religious factors played a crucial role in reshaping these cities during the period of Portuguese rule. The paper uses historical cartography to present the parallel evolution of these cities.",

          "source_summary": "This document, \"The Portuguese Empire, 1100–1932,\" discusses the Portuguese use of convict labor throughout its history, starting from the medieval period and extending to the 20th century. It examines how convicts were used as manpower in the army, navy, and in colonial infrastructure projects in Angola and Mozambique. The text specifically mentions the use of convict soldiers during Portugal's expansion into Ceuta in 1415 and North Africa, tying directly to the 'احتلال البرتغاليين لسبتة' event. It also details the changing nature of punishment and the different roles convicts played over time, from populating frontier towns to serving as cultural intermediaries and providing labor in colonies. The document further provides specific examples of legal codes, court practices, and penal colonies, offering a comprehensive overview of the Portuguese penal system and its impact on the empire's expansion and maintenance, which directly involves the subject of the Portuguese presence in North Africa starting with the Ceuta conquest.",

            "Convict labor had its roots in Roman law and the creation of the Portuguese nation-state in the high Middle Ages.",

            "The growth of the Portuguese Empire was bolstered by convict labor, providing additional manpower for the army and the navy.",
            "Convicts and their labor were a critical aspect of the frontier, state formation, overseas expansion, the military, social control, the slow demise of slavery, penal reform, and New Imperialism in Portuguese history.",
            "Before the 1850s, Portuguese legal codes were compilations collected during the reign of a monarch, such as the 1450 Ordenações Afonsinas, the 1521 Ordenações Manuelinas, and the 1603 Ordenações Filipinas.",
            "Crimes were categorized as unpardonable, serious, or minor.",
            "Unpardonable crimes included heresy, treason, sodomy, counterfeiting money, and forging documents.",
            "Punishment often involved banishment or exile (degredo) for a determined period.",
            "Women formed an estimated 5% of the total convict population and were sent to Castro Marim and Brazil.",
            "Portugal was precocious in forming a national legal code and judicial system during the Reconquista.",
            "The king ordered in July 1582 that local magistrates certify the names of convicts being conducted on chain-gangs, their sentences, where they have been banished, for how long, their ages, and any identifying marks.",
            "The main jail in Lisbon was Limoeiro, originally a royal place and later the royal mint, converted into a public prison by 1481.",
            "A 1689 bailiff’s notebook from Limoeiro listed 54 convicts, their names, crimes, and sentences.",
            "Convicts were encouraged to move to border towns in the far north or extreme east of Portugal to avoid legal prosecution, a practice well established by the reign of King D. Dinis (ruled 1279–1325).",
            "In 1406 King João I limited the number of legal havens to five.",
            "From 1415 to 1500, convicts played roles as emergency manpower as soldiers and cultural intermediaries in the Portuguese Empire's expansion.",
            "Convict soldiers were at the forefront of the expansion of Portugal into Ceuta in 1415 and North Africa.",
            "Sentences of degredo could be cut in half with military service in North Africa.",
            "Portugal captured thirteen port cities along the coast of modern Morocco between 1415 and 1515.",
            "Convicts were often left ashore on voyages of exploration to make contact with local people, learn their languages and cultures, and act as intermediaries.",
            "The practice of sending convicts to Africa continued until the great depression of the 1930s."

It details how Spain initially focused on occupying strategic ports like Ceuta, Melilla, and others, primarily for defensive purposes against North African corsairs rather than developing them into thriving commercial hubs. The article mentions Portugal's earlier conquest of Ceuta in 1415 and its subsequent transfer to Spanish control in 1640, highlighting Ceuta's role as a key Spanish possession in North Africa. It explores the limited port infrastructure development in these enclaves and the shift towards a more expansionist approach in the 19th century, using Ceuta and Melilla as platforms for penetration into Morocco. Despite this, modernization of port facilities remained inadequate until the early 20th century, coinciding with the establishment of Spanish and French protectorates in Morocco. The article concludes by examining the impact of Moroccan independence on these ports and their adaptation to changing political and economic circumstances, drawing parallels between historical corsair conflicts and contemporary challenges like illegal immigration.",

The thesis analyzes texts from the 15th and early 16th centuries, including chronicles, travel accounts, royal decrees, papal bulls, and works in verse, to understand how the military conquest of Ceuta was transformed into a foundational event for Portuguese maritime expansion and imperial ideology. The thesis proposes that the imperialist vision of King Manuel I (1469-1521) was based on the idea of a unified project of overseas conquest, originating with the capture of Ceuta. The research also highlights that Ceuta remained officially under Portuguese rule until 1656 and was initially part of a series of Iberian attacks against the Arab world.",

The essay aims to examine the Moor as a construct that resists simple categorization and explores the literary and ideological constructions of the Moor in medieval Portugal. It mentions Ceuta as a place known to Portugal across the Mediterranean, connecting it to the proximity and familiarity of Africa during that period. The article also refers to Gomes Eanes de Zurara as the first chronicler of Portuguese exploration into West Africa. It further touches upon the evolving critical perspectives on the Moor, moving away from strict self/other binaries in analyzing European texts of the Middle Ages and Renaissance. Finally, the article analyzes the cultural work of the Moor in medieval Iberia, considering factors like race, spirituality, and sexuality.",

The document mentions Ceuta's historical role as Morocco's gateway to the outside world, and a major transit point between Europe and Africa, making it a central hub for Mediterranean trade. It emphasizes the city's long period of self-governance and its importance to the Strait of Gibraltar region, where Christian powers (Castile, Aragon, Genoa, and Portugal) and Islamic powers (Moroccan-Nasrid) competed for dominance. Specifically, the text details the Portuguese conquest of Ceuta on Wednesday, 14 Jumada al-Akhira 818 AH, corresponding to August 21, 1415 AD, taking advantage of the internal divisions and crises in Morocco during the late Marinid period. The conquest is characterized as a turning point in Moroccan history with lasting political and economic consequences. The study aims to examine Ceuta's strategic and commercial importance, its trade relations with Western Mediterranean powers, and the external ambitions culminating in the Portuguese takeover. It will also explore the motives behind the Portuguese conquest and its impact on Morocco's cultural development.",

Crucially, it begins by mentioning the capture of Ceuta in 1415 as the starting point of the Portuguese Empire.

Freed from threats of invasion, the Portuguese turned their attention overseas to North Africa and in 1415 attacked and conquered Ceuta, a strategically important Muslim enclave on the Mediterranean Sea, which marked the beginning of Portuguese expansion beyond the Iberian Peninsula. The primary goal was trade and the source details what was traded and where. The article further elaborates on Portuguese explorations, trade, and settlements in Africa, Asia (including India, China, and Japan), and the Americas, detailing key figures, dates, and events, including the Treaty of Tordesillas and the establishment of trading posts and forts. The article describes the various stages of expansion including naval outposts, trade networks, relations with Spain, conflicts with other European powers and local populations, and the eventual decline due to overextension.",

While the primary focus is the Western Sahara issue and Morocco's position from 1956-1974, the abstract establishes the historical context by discussing the European (Spanish-French) colonial policies and their impact on Morocco. It mentions that the Western Sahara issue arose from the competition among European colonial powers and their conflicts with Arab countries at the end of the 19th century. It further states that Morocco faced colonial hegemony, with powers seeking to exploit its strategic coastal borders, leading Spain and France to divide Morocco into spheres of influence and protection. This enabled Spain to annex the Western Sahara due to its southern coastal presence on the Atlantic Ocean. Though the core topic is not specifically the Portuguese occupation of Ceuta, the broader context of European colonialism in Morocco, including the strategic importance of its coastal regions, is relevant as it shows a pattern of European powers vying for control of Moroccan territory for strategic and colonial reasons which is relevant to understanding the environment in which Ceuta was also a target.",

It discusses how history was used as a political tool, with organic historians promoting a nationalist vision, accommodated historians sometimes defending the Portuguese Empire, and oppositional historians challenging the regime's narratives, particularly concerning colonialism. It uses three historians as case studies: João Ameal (organic), Alexandre Lobato (accommodated), and António Borges Coelho (oppositional).

It starts by mentioning that Portugal was the first European power to establish a colony in Africa with the capture of Ceuta in 1415. The paper analyzes the reverse migration from Portugal to its former colonies in postcolonial Africa, particularly Angola and Mozambique, driven by economic crisis in Portugal and the need for skilled labor in the developing African nations. It explores the historical factors, such as \"luso-tropicalism,\" that facilitated this migration, and examines the economic and political relationships between Portugal and its former colonies. The paper also touches upon the impact of Portuguese migration on the economies of Angola and Mozambique, as well as the social and cultural aspects of this reverse migration. It further examines the renewed interest of Portugal in Angola and Mozambique in the post-civil war era, marked by increased diplomatic visits and bilateral agreements aimed at deepening trade and investment relations. The paper acknowledges the search for African El-dorado, the unsettling impact of colonialism and traces the historical context of this migration.",

The thesis, as described, addresses the origins of Portuguese commercial expansion, the integration of Portuguese merchants into European markets, and the development of mercantile techniques. It explores the relationships between Portugal and various European regions like England, Flanders, Normandy, and Brittany. It examines the impact of events like the Hundred Years' War and the Treaty of Windsor on Portuguese trade. The thesis also considers whether the conquest of Ceuta in 1415 was advantageous for Portuguese traders and if the 15th-century trade with European markets was influenced by overseas expansion. While the conquest of Ceuta is mentioned as a potential economic alternative sought by the Portuguese due to difficulties in European markets, it ultimately proved to be an economic disaster. The summary also covers the organization of merchants, trade patterns, commercial strategies, and conflicts.",

The article explores how the chronicle, a genealogy of the Kilwa kings, was printed in Portuguese in 1552 and examines the differences between the Portuguese and Arabic versions. It suggests that the chronicle may have been 'co-written' as a result of the encounter, rather than being based on a single original manuscript. The text discusses the Portuguese perspective on writing in Africa, their initial interactions with literate African societies, and their efforts to understand and exploit existing trade networks. The article details Francisco d’Almeida’s sacking of Kilwa in 1505 and the subsequent Portuguese occupation, as related in the Kilwa Chronicle. It highlights the contrasting Swahili narrative of the Portuguese arrival, emphasizing their initial trust followed by the realization of the Portuguese's corrupt intentions. Furthermore, it scrutinizes Joao de Barros's role as a chronicler of Portuguese expansion and his access to various sources, including the Kilwa Chronicle. The article proposes the hypothesis that the Arabic Kilwa Chronicle was a reply to the Portuguese version and challenges the assumption of a pre-existing written historical tradition in Kilwa. The conclusion emphasizes the importance of considering the material and social conditions of writing, keeping, and circulating texts when studying the circulation of genres.",

The article explores the ideological articulation of the Discoveries with Portugal's national identity, the defense of Portuguese colonialism, and the themes of national rebirth, Luso-Messianism, and precedence claims in relation to the colonial project.

While it does not directly discuss the Portuguese occupation of Ceuta, it does present information about the later Spanish presence and control over Ceuta, which is pertinent for providing historical context and a comparative analysis to fully understand the event \"احتلال البرتغاليين لسبتة\".\n\nThe article explores the colonial model used by Spain, the organization and life within these presidios, and the complex relationships between the Spanish occupants and the indigenous Arab populations. It delves into aspects like military organization, desertion, the integration or exclusion of Arabs, civilian life, and the economic challenges faced by these enclaves.\n\nThe article states that in 1745, Ceuta had a small number of Arabs within its walls who received pensions from the government, a practice not tolerated in other Spanish enclaves like Alhucemas, Peñón, and Melilla. Furthermore, the article mentions a royal order from June 16, 1721, which declared Ceuta a free port. The text also notes that in 1791, after the cession of Oran, Muslims who did not want to remain in the country were transported to Ceuta, where they were given a special quarter near the Iglesia delos Remedios and lived under the authority of an imam.",

The review further discusses the period between 1486 and 1516 as a glorious period for Portuguese activity in Morocco, the efforts during the reign of Alphonse V, including the capture of El-Qsar es-Sgîr in 1458, Arzila and Tanger in 1471, and the reign of D. Manuel (1495-1521). It also touches upon Portuguese expansion into the south of Morocco, founding Mazagan, Mogador, Santa Cruz d'Agadir, and capturing Safi and Azemmour, as well as incursions towards Marrakech and the Atlas Mountains. The review also mentions the Portuguese defeat at La Mamora in 1515 and the loss of Nuno Fernandes de Ataide and Yahya Ou Tacfouft before the death of D. Manuel, and their struggle against the Saadian Sharifs until 1541, culminating in the capture of Agadir in 1541 by Mohammed ech-Cheikh, marking the beginning of their decline.",

It mentions that Ceuta was conquered by Portugal in 1415 from the Marinid Kingdom, and remained under Portuguese rule until 1640, when it became Spanish. The article analyzes the evolving political positioning of various parties on the Spanish sovereignty of the enclaves since the return of democracy in Spain in 1975, highlighting a constant questioning of Spanish control and the emergence of local and community-based parties. It details the struggle for autonomy, the issue of citizenship for Muslims, and the results of various municipal elections, including the rise of the PP and communautarian parties. The document covers Ceuta's multicultural identity as an enclave, and issues surrounding national identity, Moroccan claims on Ceuta, and the region's militarization.",

While the main focus is geological, the text mentions historical elements relevant to the Portuguese occupation of Ceuta. Specifically, it details a Portuguese garrison from Ceuta attempting to attack Tetouan in 1545 and burning pirate ships anchored in the port of Beni Madan, located in a meander of the Oued Martil. The text also mentions a Spanish fleet's attempt to block pirates in 1565 by sinking ships at the river's mouth, actions which reflect the strategic importance of the area and the ongoing conflicts involving Ceuta after the Portuguese conquest. Piracy thrived in the region during the late 15th century, contributing to Tetouan's prosperity. The document also notes that the Martil River was navigable by small boats in antiquity and as late as the 19th century, and the location of the archeological site of Tamuda. The text further details how the plain's landscape was modified during the Spanish Protectorate and after Moroccan independence with drainage projects starting in the 1920s. Finally the establishment of the town of Martil in 1914 on the site of a military post, Fuerte Martín, marks a further step in the permanent human modification of the plain.",

It discusses how these bulls, while numerous (69 between 1418 and 1499), didn't represent a systematic papal policy but rather interventions when requested. A key point is that the struggle against Islam was a major element, framed more as reconquest than crusade.  The capture of Ceuta in 1415 is highlighted as a pivotal event, shifting the war against Muslims to the African shores. This 'just war' led to the enslavement of prisoners, according to the laws of the time. The review notes that the bulls place more emphasis on the conquest of Morocco than on discoveries, and that African voyages aimed to secure an alliance with Christian Ethiopia against the Maghreb Muslims. The reviewer summarizes de Witte's argument that this ecclesiastical history of Portuguese expansion is rooted in the past, within the traditional framework of the fight against the Moors, belonging to the Middle Ages.",

          "source_summary": "This article discusses the expansion of the Portuguese empire starting in the 15th century. It begins with the context of Portugal's geographic advantages, its history of Reconquista, and religious motivations, explaining Portugal's early expansion and the capture of Ceuta in 1415 under Dom João I. Ceuta was targeted due to its importance as a commercial hub and a base for piracy, as well as its proximity to Portugal. The article outlines the aftermath of Ceuta's capture, including the appointment of Infante Dom Henrique as governor and the subsequent expeditions down the African coast. It also mentions the discovery of Madeira and the Azores and the initial focus on African exploration for gold and slaves. The text then moves to the reigns of subsequent kings, Dom Duarte and Dom Afonso V, highlighting the expeditions of Gil Eanes and Antão Gonçalves. Later, Dom João II’s reign saw further exploration, including the voyages of Diogo Cão and Bartolomeu Dias, who rounded the Cape of Good Hope, opening the route to India. The article describes Dom Manuel I’s reign and Vasco da Gama's voyage to India in 1497-1498, establishing a direct sea route to the East. Furthermore, it details Portuguese actions to secure trade routes, establish fortresses (like Goa and Malacca), and spread Christianity through missionary work. The Estado da Índia, a Portuguese administrative system, is described, along with its organization and eventual decline due to internal and external factors, including competition from other European powers. Finally, the text touches on the role of \"lançados\" (Portuguese adventurers) and the complexities of religious conversion.",

Le Maghreb en première ligne face à l’expansion européenne\" from the book \"Histoire des pays d'Islam De 1453 à nos jours\", discusses the political landscape of the Maghreb at the dawn of the 16th century, highlighting its internal divisions and vulnerability to European expansion. It explains that Maghrebi powers were primarily focused on controlling trade routes, ports, and important cities for tax revenue and access to European arms, while internal tribes often recognized only the religious legitimacy of rulers without paying taxes. The chapter argues that the fragmented nature of the Maghreb at the beginning of the 16th century made it an attractive target for external forces. The Wattasid dynasty of Fes (1472-1549) had weak ties with Marrakech, and important cities such as Safi, Bougie, and Tripoli enjoyed near complete independence. This overview of the Maghreb's political situation leading up to and during the 15th century is relevant as the Portuguese conquest of Ceuta happened in 1415.",

While the chapter itself doesn't directly discuss the Portuguese conquest of Ceuta, it does set the stage by describing the political landscape of North Africa and the Iberian Peninsula in the late 14th and early 15th centuries, specifically detailing the weakening of the Marinid dynasty in Morocco, the intrigues of the emirs of Granada (Benou-l Ahmar), and the conflicts between various Muslim rulers in the region. The text mentions the sultan mérinide Abd-el-Aziz, the emirs of Grenada Yousof II and Mohammed VI, and the hafçide sultan Abd-el-Aziz in Tunis. It also notes that the Sultan of Fas took advantage of conflicts to defeat Tlemcen. Furthermore, it mentions that the Sultan of Fas still held places in the Iberian Peninsula, including Gibraltar, and was supported by Muslim corsairs who harassed Christian ships. The general state of disunity and conflict among the Muslim powers in North Africa and the Iberian Peninsula provides context for the later Portuguese conquest of Ceuta in 1415, although the source does not directly mention the event or its immediate causes.

          "source_summary": "This article discusses the architectural and communicational strategies employed in Ceuta (Sebta) under Spanish control, focusing on how architecture is used to assert identity and power. It analyzes the historical layers of Spanish architectural influence, particularly during the protectorate period (1910-1930), and the subsequent Francoist era, arguing that architectural choices are often driven by political motives rather than aesthetic or contextual considerations. The article highlights the tension between Spanish architectural impositions and local Moroccan identity, and the impact of these impositions on the urban landscape and the local population. It uses the 'House of Dragons' as a case study of the complex symbolic and political meanings embedded within Ceuta's architecture. Although the article does not directly describe the Portuguese conquest, it provides the background and context for understanding how Ceuta was transformed into a Spanish city over time, which is a consequence of the initial occupation of Ceuta by the Portuguese, since it was passed to Spanish control later.",

It details various skirmishes, battles, intrigues, and peaceful exchanges between the two entities. Crucially, it mentions the Portuguese conquest of Ceuta (Sabta) in 1415 as a foundational act in Portugal's maritime expansion and imperial ambitions. The article explores the motivations behind the Ceuta conquest, including satisfying a turbulent nobility and potentially forcing Castile to acknowledge Portugal's role in the fight against Granada. The text further elaborates on Portugal's subsequent engagements in Morocco, the defense of Ceuta, and the complex relationship between Portugal, the Wattasids, and other Moroccan factions. The article emphasizes the strategic importance of Ceuta in relation to control of the Strait of Gibraltar.",

The abstract indicates that from the 12th century onward, forest management evolved from protection to intense exploitation. During the maritime expansion (15th-16th centuries), massive naval construction led to the felling of approximately 5 million trees, mainly Quercus suber, Pinus pinea, and other Quercus species. The document also notes cumulative fuel-wood consumption and deforestation rates between 1300 and 1854. The Portuguese occupation of Ceuta in 1415 initiated a new phase of Portuguese expansion. The impact on the forests is indirect but related because naval construction was required to continue the conquest and supply of Ceuta. The Portuguese occupation of Ceuta spurred Portuguese maritime expansion.",

          "source_summary": "This article discusses the influence of Italian military architecture on Portuguese fortifications, particularly from the 15th to 17th centuries. While the article doesn't directly discuss the Portuguese conquest of Ceuta, it provides valuable context on Portuguese fortifications during the period, and mentions Ceuta as one of the places where Portuguese fortifications were built, highlighting a context in which Portugal actively fortified its territories, including Ceuta. The article explores the adoption of Italian fortification techniques and the roles of Italian architects and engineers in shaping Portuguese defensive strategies. It details the evolution of fortifications, including bastions and artillery placements, and how these innovations were implemented in Portugal and its overseas territories, like Mazagan. The study highlights the circulation of knowledge and the collaboration between Portuguese and Italian military experts during this period, leading to a more unified and effective defense system used by the Portuguese monarchy. It discusses the specific example of Mazagan and its development in the face of new artillery technologies and in regards to models from Italian military architecture, as well as brief mention of other places with strong Portuguese military presence. While not directly about the conquest, it informs about Portuguese military architecture in the early-mid 15th century (around when Ceuta was conquered).",

The text highlights how Europeans, specifically the Portuguese, seized strategic ports, preventing the emergence of a Maghrebi power with imperial ambitions, referencing previous dynasties like the Almoravids and Almohads. It also links these events to the eventual Ottoman conquest of the Maghreb in the 16th century.

The article discusses the crisis of the 15th century, where the Merinid dynasty declined and the Wattasids failed to establish authority, coinciding with the Portuguese occupation of Ceuta (Sabta) in 1415 and subsequent Portuguese expansion along the Atlantic coast. It analyzes the impact of the Portuguese occupation, along with other factors such as internal strife and economic changes, on the weakening of the Moroccan state. The article also examines the severe drought and epidemics of the 16th century and the state's response to natural disasters in the 17th century under Moulay Ismail. It concludes by reflecting on the long-term effects of these calamities on Moroccan society and governance, and the lessons for the present day in managing natural resources and environmental challenges.",

Ndlovu-Gatsheni, published in Africa Development Journal in 2015, discusses the historical conception of Africa and its integration into Euro-North American modernity through genealogies of coloniality and African resistance. It outlines eight broad, overlapping epochs in the production of Africa that have impacted its development, starting with the paradigm of discovery and mercantilist order from the 15th to 18th centuries. This period includes the slave trade and mercantilism. The article argues that Africa's development challenges are deeply rooted in these overlapping epochs, characterized by epistemicides, genocides, usurpations, appropriations, and disruptions, and that Africa continues to struggle against global colonial power matrices that have been in place since the time of colonial encounters.",

The study uses scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) to determine the elemental composition of corrosion products and alloys. X-ray powder diffraction spectroscopy (XRD) identifies crystalline corrosion products in the patinas. Electrochemical studies were performed on a deteriorated coin, AE 3, in Na2SO4 aqueous solution, and analyzed, and the electrochemical behaviour of the coins was investigated through voltammetric data.

A significant event discussed is the conquest of Ceuta by Portugal in 1415, which is placed within the context of Portuguese expansion after the occupation of the Algarve. The thesis also mentions Ceuta's dependence on Portugal after the union of the crowns under Felipe II in 1580, and its subsequent shift towards its legitimate king in 1640, recognized in the Treaty of Lisbon in 1660. Furthermore, it covers the 'Gran Sitio,' the Alawi dynasty's attempts to seize Ceuta and Melilla, the Spanish-Moroccan War of 1859-1860, the establishment of the Spanish Protectorate in Morocco in the early 20th century, Ceuta's role in the Spanish Civil War, and the Perejil Island incident in 2002.

It begins by outlining the proposal for defining this cultural route, citing key locations such as Ceuta, Alkazar-Seguer, Tangier, Arcila, Mamora, Azamor, Mazagan, Safi, and Aguz. The document then delves into the historical context, marking the route's chronological beginning with the Portuguese capture of Ceuta in 1415 and concluding with the Portuguese withdrawal from Mazagão in 1769. It touches on Spain's presence, particularly Ceuta, and its historical complexities. The text details the political landscape of Morocco during the period of Iberian expansion, distinguishing between territories under direct sultanate control (Mahzen) and those with greater autonomy (Shiba). It identifies a period of weakness in Morocco following the Merinid dynasty, which facilitated Portuguese conquests. The rise of the Saadi dynasty and their shift towards conquests in Mali, specifically Tombuctú, led to a decline in interest in reconquering coastal territories from the Portuguese. The document also categorizes the proposed route as linear and mixed (terrestrial and maritime). It highlights the political, economic, and socio-cultural importance of these fortifications. The document mentions the involvement of the Avis, Habsburg, and Braganza dynasties. It specifies that Juan I captured Ceuta in 1415. The document discusses the evolving strategies of the Portuguese, from military conquest to establishing trading outposts (factorias). It mentions the reign of King Sebastian and the disastrous Battle of Alcazarquivir. Finally, it concludes by reiterating the need to define the route, considering political, economic, and social aspects, and highlights the importance of understanding the architectural typologies of fortifications in relation to geopolitical dynamics.",

It starts with the Castilian interest in North Africa due to gold payments from Granada. The text highlights early expeditions to the Canary Islands and the African coast before and after Cape Bojador. It focuses on Prince Henry the Navigator's role in financing these voyages. The conquest of Ceuta in 1415 is mentioned as Portugal's initial foothold in Africa, justified as a crusade, while expeditions to the Canary Islands in the same period are documented. The document details the significance of Gil Eanes's successful navigation beyond Cape Bojador in 1434 and the subsequent exploration further south. It also touches upon the introduction of the caravel, the shift towards slave trade, and the establishment of trading posts like Arguim and Cabo Verde. The text concludes by mentioning the Portuguese reaching Sierra Leone, the Congo, and eventually the Indian Ocean, and how Castile's interest was sparked, leading to conflict and eventually the Treaty that denied Castile access to African gold, linking this to Columbus's later focus on gold.",

The text details the early religious administration, including the appointment of bishops and the transformation of the Mezquita Aljama into a cathedral. It examines the development of chapels dedicated to the Holy Sacrament within the cathedral over the centuries, the establishment and evolution of religious brotherhoods (cofradías) focused on the sacrament, and the organization of processions such as Corpus Christi.

Regarding the Portuguese presence, the paper mentions the conquest of Ceuta in 1415 as one of the initial marks of Portuguese expansion in Morocco. It details Portugal's ambitions to control territory across the Strait of Gibraltar and highlights the historical context, motivations, and consequences of the Portuguese presence in Ceuta and other coastal regions of Morocco. The paper touches upon the initial period of Portuguese conquests, the establishment of trading posts (factorias) and fortresses (praças), and their gradual abandonment, leading up to the eventual ceding of Ceuta to Spain in 1640. Furthermore, it also mentions the role of Jews during this period. Finally, it alludes to the architectural and linguistic influence, like the Portuguese etymological origin of some words in dariya.",

The document details the presence of Chinese porcelain, Rhenish stoneware, Italian majolica, and Iberian glazed earthenware, highlighting their respective origins and how they arrived in Alcázar Seguer through Mediterranean and Atlantic trade networks controlled by the Portuguese. The analysis considers the social distribution of these ceramics within the fortress, suggesting that certain types were likely limited to higher social strata. Connections with Andalusia and Lisbon are highlighted regarding the ceramic supplies. The text mentions the integration of Alcázar Seguer into Mediterranean and Atlantic commercial circuits after the Portuguese conquest.",

It examines how these principalities, though theoretically within Portugal's sphere of influence, were perceived as threats by the Spanish due to their piracy and support for Granadan Muslims. The study details diplomatic efforts, military considerations, and trade relations between Spain and these North African entities. Key figures include Hernando de Zafra, the Count of Tendilla, Ali Barrax, and Al-Mandari. The text discusses attempts to negotiate peace, secure tributes, and address piracy, as well as strategic considerations regarding fortifying locations like the Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera and Alhucemas. It also covers the complex relationships between Spain and Portugal concerning influence in North Africa, culminating in the Treaty of Sintra (1509). The restoration of Tetouan by Granadan exiles and its role as a corsair center is explored. The document also outlines failed plans to attack Tetouan and the eventual decision to build a tower at the mouth of the Martil River to control Tetouan's maritime activity.",

While the listing does not provide specific details about the Portuguese occupation of Ceuta, the fact that it covers Africa and its islands during the period of Valentim Fernandes (early 16th Century) makes it potentially relevant, as it would likely contain information regarding Portuguese explorations and settlements in Africa, making it necessary to check the actual content to confirm its relevance.",

It details the voyages, motivations, and geographical scope of these explorations, particularly concerning the Canary Islands, Madeira, and the African coast. The document also covers the evolving rivalry between Portugal and Castile for control and influence in these regions, with papal bulls and treaties playing a significant role. The Portuguese capture of Ceuta in 1415 is discussed, highlighting its initial importance and subsequent limitations as a gateway to African resources, eventually leading to further exploration down the African coast. The reign of Prince Henry the Navigator and his contribution to Portuguese exploration is given significant attention, as well as some of the key people and events that supported it. The Tratado de Alcáçovas-Toledo of 1479-1480 is detailed, specifying the territorial possessions of Portugal and Castile. The text also includes information on the early cartography of the Atlantic region.",

One paper included, titled \"Evidencias de explotación de recursos marinos en la orilla norteafricana del estrecho de Gibraltar por sociedades del Pleistoceno en el Abrigo de Benzú (Ceuta)\" by Juan Jesús Cantillo, José Ramos, Mila Soriguer y Darío Bernal, directly discusses archaeological findings in Ceuta related to the exploitation of marine resources. The paper presents evidence from the Abrigo de Benzú site in Ceuta, documenting the exploitation of marine resources by societies in the Pleistocene era. It details the stratigraphy of the site, the types of mollusks found, and the methods used for their extraction and analysis. It also draws comparisons with similar findings in other regions, like the Iberian Peninsula. This is relevant to the historical context of Ceuta, even if it predates the specific event of the Portuguese conquest.",
          "extracted_key_facts": [
            "The Abrigo de Benzú site is located in Ceuta, North Africa, near the Strait of Gibraltar.",

            "Excavations at the site have revealed a sequence of ten stratigraphic levels, with seven showing evidence of human occupation from the Middle and Upper Pleistocene.",
            "Dating of the levels includes: Level 10 (Th/U, IGM: ± 70 Ka), Level 7, Level 5 (OSL, Shfd 020136: 168 ± 11 Ka), Level 3b (Th/U, IGM: 173 ± 10 Ka), and Level 2 (OSL, Shfd 020135: 254 ± 17 Ka).",
            "The site shows clear evidence of the exploitation of littoral resources, particularly mollusks (Patellidae) from Level 7 to Level 1 and ictiofauna in Level 5a.",
            "The most common mollusks found are gasteropods, especially non-spiral gasteropods from the Patellidae family (limpets).",
            "Documented species include Patella sp. (possibly P. vulgata), Patella rustica, Patella caerulea, and Siphonaria Pectinata.",
            "The lithic industry is identified as Mode 3-Mousterian, with a significant number of lithic remains analyzed (36,092 specimens).",
            "The technology employed in the extraction of marine resources remains unknown.",
            "The site is interpreted as a recurrently frequented location for hunter-gatherer societies that exploited marine resources.",
            "Comparisons are drawn between resource exploitation by Neanderthals in the Iberian Peninsula and Homo sapiens sapiens in Africa.",
            "The Strait of Gibraltar is considered a bridge rather than a border for prehistoric societies.",
            "The research team is from the University of Cádiz, led by José Ramos and Darío Bernal.",
            "The analysis of marine fauna was a key part of J.J. Cantillo's doctoral thesis (2012).",
            "Accumulations of shells, along with terrestrial fauna, suggest a human activity area related to consumption or refuse."

          "source_summary": "This article discusses the role of ecclesiastics in the consolidation of the Avis dynasty in Portugal (1385-1433), focusing on their influence on foreign policy, particularly during the reign of John I. While the article's primary focus is broader than the conquest of Ceuta, it directly addresses it as a key event used to increase the prestige of the Avis dynasty. Ecclesiastical figures were vital in diplomatic efforts to secure legitimacy and international recognition for the new dynasty, negotiating with the papacy, Castile, and participating in ecumenical councils. The article examines the backgrounds, motivations, and contributions of specific ecclesiastics involved in these diplomatic missions and how their roles evolved over time. The conquest of Ceuta in 1415 is presented as a consequence of achieving these diplomatic goals, undertaken to further legitimize the Avis dynasty and expand Christendom, though the ecclesiastics had less influence in the immediate planning and execution of the military action itself. The article also touches upon the evolving relationship between the Portuguese monarchy and the Church during this period, and the influence of ecclesiastical figures on the formulation and execution of foreign policy, and mentions the continued war against the sarracens in North African territories with the conquest of Ceuta in 1415. The analysis highlights how the conquest fits into the broader context of consolidating the Avis dynasty's power and influence.",

The article details the site's location, stratigraphy, and chronology, dating back to the Middle and Upper Pleistocene. It discusses the types of marine mollusks and fish found, the methods of excavation, and the interpretation of the site as a recurring seasonal habitat for hunter-gatherer-fisher societies. It also touches upon the broader implications of these findings for understanding the relationship between different human groups in the Gibraltar Strait region during the Paleolithic. While the text does not directly address the Portuguese conquest of Ceuta (سبتة) in 1415, it provides important historical context about Ceuta's early history.",

            "The analysis shows a regional vegetation comprised primarily of Cedrus and Pinus, with local vegetation including Quercus-p, Olea, algarrobo, and riverine elements.",
            "The site provides evidence of the exploitation of marine resources, particularly mollusks (Patellids), throughout the stratigraphic sequence, dating back to before 254 ± 17 Ka, and ictiofauna in level 5a (168 ± 11 Ka).",
            "The malacofauna is dominated by the Gasteropoda class, with Patellidae family being the most abundant in all stratigraphic levels, followed by Siphonariidae.",

M., discusses the antecedents of Portuguese overseas expansion, including the political and religious climate, particularly the role of the papacy and the fight against the Saracens. It specifically mentions the conquest of Ceuta in 1415 as a key event marking the beginning of Portuguese imperial formation. The text analyzes papal bulls and other documents related to Portugal's interactions with the Islamic world from the 12th to the 15th centuries. It details the complex relationship between Portugal, the papacy, and other Iberian kingdoms in the context of the Reconquista and the expansion of Christendom. The text further discusses the evolution of the Portuguese attitude towards the Saracens, the religious and political dimensions of this struggle, the crusades, and the support Portugal received from the papacy for its efforts against the Muslims, which ultimately provided a foundation for future overseas expansion.",

The article discusses the territorial expansion of the Castilian kingdom during the 15th century towards the south, North Africa, and the Atlantic islands, where it encountered Portuguese interests, leading to a rivalry that ended with the Treaty of Alcáçobas in 1479. The article also explores the political stances and papal documents supporting both sides during this period of rivalry and the development of a juridical-moral doctrine that would later be used in the discoveries and conquests in the New World. The article does not describe the conquest of Ceuta directly, but does mention campaigns in North Africa and rivalry with Portugal, which is indirectly related to the broader context of Portuguese expansion during that era.",

It details Portugal's early dominance in African coastal settlements and trade, followed by other European powers. Spain's initial focus was on America, but it maintained presence in cities like Melilla and Ceuta. The article describes Portugal's shift towards African territories after Brazil's independence, expanding its empire. Spain's colonial actions were less consistent but became more focused on Africa after losing overseas colonies in 1898. It covers the colonial crisis of the late 19th century for both countries, the establishment of the Spanish protectorate in Morocco, and the eventual decolonization processes. The article also touches on the post-independence cooperation between Spain/Portugal and their former colonies, with Spain focusing on development aid and Portugal on ecological and migratory issues.",
