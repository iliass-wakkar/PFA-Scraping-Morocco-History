It highlights that Morocco has been the occupying power for 47 years. The article notes that major international organizations (UN, EU) and Western powers (US, France) maintain a degree of indeterminacy regarding the legal regime applicable to Morocco. The article further states that Spain, the former administering power, shows little interest in Morocco's compliance with international norms. Critically, it mentions that the Spanish government has recently stated its support for the \"annexationist theses\" of the Moroccan monarchy, indicating support for Morocco's claims over Western Sahara. The author suggests that Spanish international law doctrine could play a more active role in defending compliance with international law in the context of the Western Sahara conflict and Spain's foreign policy.",

It discusses the historical roots of the U.S. position, tracing back to President Trump's 2020 decision. The brief highlights how Morocco's proactive diplomacy, including King Mohammed VI's emphasis on the Sahara issue as a key element of international partnerships, has led to increased international support for the autonomy plan, including from Spain in March 2022, France, the UK, Germany and the Netherlands. The brief also examines the geopolitical repercussions of the U.S. stance, particularly in relation to Maghreb stability, security cooperation in the Sahel-Saharan region, and the Royal Atlantic Initiative. The Initiative aims to position the Moroccan Sahara as a crucial hub for Afro-Atlantic integration through projects like the Dakhla port and the Nigeria-Morocco gas pipeline. The brief concludes that the U.S. support marks a decisive diplomatic turning point, reinforcing Morocco's vision of the Sahara as a pole of stability and shared prosperity, while the Polisario Front becomes increasingly marginalized.",

The paper also highlights how Western Sahara experiences Morocco's soft power control through restricted development and the pursuit of self-determination within the UN framework. The study draws on case studies of UN negotiations, international diplomacy, and Morocco's outreach efforts to demonstrate Morocco's influence on international perspectives regarding Western Sahara.",

The analysis uses royal speeches, official publications, interviews, and online forums to explore the NDMSP’s theoretical foundations, historical context, and communication strategies. The NDMSP aims to promote participatory decision-making, economic growth, and social development in the Southern Saharan Provinces, despite facing challenges such as poor governance, political tensions, and corruption. The research emphasizes building a democratic and inclusive regionalization system that respects cultural diversity and fosters a common identity.",

The article points to bipartisan criticism of Trump's recognition of Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara and examines potential changes in US foreign policy reflected in the 2022 appropriations bill and the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). These changes include separating Western Sahara from Morocco in the appropriations bill and limiting funds for military exercises with Morocco.

          "source_summary": "This policy paper by Samir Bennis, dated January 27, 2020, discusses the underlying causes of the Morocco-Spain maritime dispute off the Atlantic coast. It examines Morocco's decision to update its maritime laws in January 2020 and the conflicting claims regarding the delimitation of their respective Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) and continental shelves, particularly in the waters off the Sahara. The paper highlights the differing views of Morocco and Spain on the applicable method for delimitation (equity vs. equidistance), the significance of the Canary Islands, and the implications of the Sahara dispute. It covers Morocco's actions to assert its sovereignty over the maritime zone off the Sahara, the Spanish media's reaction, and the legal arguments surrounding the issue, including references to UNCLOS and international jurisprudence. The paper suggests that Morocco's move to update its maritime laws aims to disrupt Spain's application to the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS) and force negotiations. It also touches upon the political dimensions of the Sahara dispute and its impact on Morocco-Spain relations. The paper indicates Spain's support for the UN-led political process on the Western Sahara and acknowledges Morocco's right to delimit its maritime borders, albeit through negotiation. Finally, it proposes co-management of natural resources as a potential provisional solution.",

            "The existence of the Canary Islands influences Morocco's defense of the method of equity, arguing that they are not a state per se and represent relevant geographical circumstances.",
            "In late 2002, Rabat and Madrid formed a working group to address maritime border delimitation and strengthen cooperation in oil exploration, fisheries, and transportation.",
            "Spain submitted its project to establish the outer limits of its continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles to the CLCS, prompting Morocco to react.",
            "Morocco rejected Spain's decision to grant an oil prospection authorization to Spanish company REPSOL in late 2001.",

It argues that the rise of internal Sahrawi pro-independence groups has reshaped the conflict, and that their identity shift from victims to human rights activists to activists involved in an unsolved conflict is a result of transnational recognition from Morocco (the annexing state), SADR (the contested state-in-exile), and the international community. The article also explores how instrumental initiatives, lacking mutuality, have complicated the struggle rather than achieving 'recognitional peace'.",

The study reveals changes in local power structures and beneficiaries of national public policies in the territory. It observes a progressive involvement in politics by the immigrant population or \"settlers,\" who now constitute the majority. The inclusion of this group in political processes, however, is argued to conflict with international norms regarding non-autonomous territories.",

It argues that Morocco uses these tensions to secure concessions regarding the Western Sahara conflict and to strengthen domestic support for the Moroccan government. The paper details the historical context of these crises, including Morocco's territorial disputes with Spain, its relationship with the EU, and internal political considerations such as the Arab Spring and subsequent reforms. The analysis highlights Morocco's attempts to influence international sentiment on the Western Sahara issue, particularly concerning Spain's position. It also examines the extent to which these crises were used to consolidate domestic political support, considering the role of nationalism and the political climate in Morocco. Ultimately, the paper concludes that Morocco leverages migration and security concerns to demand greater economic cooperation and political concessions from the EU, particularly regarding its claim over the Western Sahara. The Ceuta border incident, the study posits, successfully pressured Spain to support Morocco’s autonomy proposal for the Western Sahara.",

The article examines the clivages within the Spanish government, the defense of Morocco on the European stage, the role of Andalusia in Spanish-Moroccan cooperation, and the potential territorial and diplomatic consequences of recognizing Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara, including impacts on the agricultural sector, the status of Ceuta and Melilla, and energy relations with Algeria.

While the main focus is on renewing and improving Spain's foreign policy across various domains and regions, it directly touches upon Spain's position regarding the Western Sahara. Specifically, it mentions Spain's desire for a just and lasting political solution to the decolonization of Western Sahara, highlighting the historical responsibilities and the connection to Spain's values and interests. The report discusses the complexities of the conflict, the competing nationalisms of Morocco and the Sahrawi people, and the tensions between Morocco and Algeria. It suggests that Spain could adopt a more proactive stance in promoting a genuine and guaranteed self-governance solution that satisfies both Morocco and the Polisario Front, aligning with Spain's strategic interests and regional cooperation in the Maghreb. The document overall explores Spain's priorities and potential roles in various regions, including the Maghreb, and emphasizes the need for a coherent and integrated approach to foreign policy.",

The document examines the legal arguments of Morocco, Algeria, and the Polisario Front, as well as Spain's official position and the stance of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE). It elaborates on the economic stakes in the region, including phosphates, water resources, and potential oil deposits, and explores the reasons behind Algeria's involvement and its strategies to weaken Morocco and isolate it internationally. The document then analyzes the Polisario Front's goals and tactics, as well as the positions and strategies of Morocco and Mauritania. It delves into the reasons for Spain's withdrawal from the Sahara, the evolution of Spanish policy, and the various contacts and negotiations aimed at finding a peaceful resolution to the conflict, as well as the roles of the OAU and the UN in the matter.",

The review discusses the book's central argument, which revolves around the Moroccan initiative to grant autonomy to the Sahara region as a solution to the Western Sahara conflict, ongoing since 1976. The book, reviewed in this text, advocates for a re-evaluation of the right to self-determination, suggesting territorial autonomy within Morocco as a viable alternative to independence. It analyzes the failure of the 1990 UN settlement plan and argues that the Moroccan initiative presented to the UN in 2007 offers a foundation for a democratic and sustainable regional autonomy, drawing parallels with autonomy experiences in countries like Spain, Italy, and France. The review highlights the book's examination of the Western Sahara conflict, portraying it not as a decolonization issue, but as Morocco seeking to restore its territorial integrity. Spain is mentioned as a point of comparison for Morocco's autonomy plan.",

            "The author argues that the older, dominant approach to self-determination (independence) does not facilitate conflict resolution in certain cases.",
            "The book proposes a new conception of self-determination, which is not a systematic right to independence, but a right to democratic self-governance at the national level in the form of territorial democracy.",
            "The book argues that the Western Sahara conflict is not a conflict of self-determination (meaning independence), but rather a problem of Morocco seeking to complete its territorial integrity.",

A key factor in the improved relationship is France's recognition that the Moroccan autonomy plan for the Sahara is the \"only basis for achieving a solution\" and that the future of Western Sahara is within Moroccan sovereignty. This shift in French policy followed similar acknowledgements by the United States, Germany, and Spain, and came after a period of strained relations due to France's previous reluctance to support Morocco's position on the Sahara, visa restrictions imposed on Moroccan citizens, and a perceived rapprochement between France and Algeria. The article emphasizes that France's support for Moroccan sovereignty over the Sahara is part of a larger realignment of France's relationship with Africa, necessitated by the rise of Moroccan influence on the continent and the increasing assertion of 'African agency.' It highlights the importance of national interests and mutual respect in fostering strong partnerships and argues that France needed to align with Morocco's perspective on the Sahara to repair the relationship. The text notes that the prior strategy involved tension between Morocco and Germany/Spain which led to a clear engagement from those two states regarding the Moroccan position. It concludes that France's alignment with Morocco's position on the Sahara is a positive step towards a renewed partnership based on mutual interests and respect, reflecting a broader shift in North-South relations where African countries increasingly assert their own agendas.",

While the primary focus is on Spain's relationships with Europe, the United States, Latin America, and the Arab world, it directly mentions the decolonization of Spanish Africa, specifically the Western Sahara. The article discusses how Hassan II of Morocco exploited the conjuncture of Franco's declining health and a divided Spanish government to launch a diplomatic offensive regarding the Sahara, culminating in the Madrid Accords of November 1975. These accords effectively ceded control of the Sahara to Morocco and Mauritania, marking the end of Spanish decolonization efforts. The article also mentions that the pro-Arab policy before 1975 had served to contain Morocco and support a slow decolonization process. The legacy of the Franco era and the subsequent reinterpretation of the Madrid Accords by later Spanish governments (renouncing colonial administration but not ceding sovereignty to Morocco, advocating for Sahrawi self-determination via referendum) is discussed, setting the stage for Spain's later positions on the Western Sahara, and touches on the diplomatic context and international pressures surrounding the issue.",

While the primary focus is on the fight against terrorism, the article also touches upon the issue of the Western Sahara conflict as a factor hindering regional cooperation. Specifically, it mentions that the conflict over Western Sahara between Morocco and Algeria obstructs security cooperation, with Algeria rejecting Morocco's autonomy proposal for the region in 2007 and defending the Sahrawis' right to self-determination. It also details how Algeria declined to participate in meetings where Morocco was present due to this ongoing dispute.",

The chapter discusses Rabat's war strategy in the early 1980s, including the construction of defense walls, which led to the consideration of a referendum as the sole means of resolving the issue from 1981. While the principle of a referendum was agreed upon by both parties in 1988, its implementation was delayed due to disagreements regarding the composition of the electoral body.

While the document doesn't directly focus on Spain's support for the Moroccan autonomy plan for Western Sahara, it mentions the Western Sahara conflict as a regional issue affecting Maghreb cooperation and alludes to the US position on the Moroccan autonomy plan as something Algerians suspect. The text addresses NATO's concerns regarding security threats, counter-terrorism efforts, and the complexities of engaging with Arab countries. It also covers the challenges and limitations of the Mediterranean Dialogue and the impact of events like 9/11 and the Iraq War on NATO's strategy in the region.

In light of these tensions, Morocco seeks support from Western, particularly European, states, prioritizing economic integration over regional political cooperation. The article suggests that King Mohammed VI has modernized Moroccan diplomacy, shifting it towards a more economic and professional approach due to globalization and regional instability in the Maghreb.

It provides background information on the political and social dynamics of the region. The text mentions the Moroccan autonomy plan for Western Sahara presented in 2007 and the new constitution of 2011, highlighting how the Moroccan authorities aim to integrate the 'Southern Provinces' (Western Sahara) by promoting the Hassaniya culture as an equal part of the Moroccan nation, which could be interpreted as undermining the Sahrawi independence claims. The text also references Spain's historical role as a former colonial power and the continued use of Spanish language among Sahrawis as a differentiator from Moroccan culture. Further, the diaspora in Spain is mentioned as a center for activism.",

            "The region is often described as endemically unstable due to fragile state models, hierarchical social systems, and reformist theological projects.",
            "The Sahara has seen contestations of power, authorities, social and religious orders, and national borders, facilitated by new communication technologies since the early 2000s.",
            "Mauritania experienced a coup in 2005 and the rise of General Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, who composed with the Islamist party and faced social movements demanding recognition and reparation for socio-economic discriminations.",
            "In Western Sahara, the diplomatic stalemate persists since the 1991 ceasefire between the Polisario Front and the Moroccan state, with ongoing infrastructure construction, population settlement from Morocco, exploitation of resources, cultural assimilation of the Sahrawi minority, and repression of human rights.",
            "The 'intifada' of 2005, the hunger strike of Aminatou Haidar in 2009, and the Gdeim Izik camp in 2010 brought the political situation of the territory to international attention, with debates centering on expanding the MINURSO mandate to human rights monitoring.",
            "The Polisario Front and RASD, based in refugee camps in Tindouf (Algeria), face internal dissensions regarding maintaining trust in the UN versus returning to armed struggle.",
            "Morocco is strengthening its position in Western Sahara by integrating the 'Southern Provinces' through development programs and promoting an autonomy plan announced by King Mohamed VI in 2007.",
            "The 2011 Moroccan constitution officially gives the Sahrawi culture and language (Hassaniya) equal status with Arabic and Berber cultures.",
            "Algeria remains a steadfast supporter of the Polisario Front and the Sahrawi people, funding development programs in the Tindouf camps, arming the Sahrawi Liberation Army (ALS), and hosting young people from the camps in its educational institutions.",
            "The text mentions the historic role of Spain in the region and the significance of the Spanish language among Sahrawis.",
            "Morocco obtained UNESCO 'world heritage' status for the Moussem of Tan Tan in 2005, which can be seen as a diplomatic victory, as it is an international recognition of Morocco's efforts to promote Sahrawi culture within the framework of Moroccan national construction.",
            "Spain is mentioned in the context of collaborative conservation project of Sahrawi poetry between an anthropologist and poets of the refugee camps and the Spanish-speaking poets known as 'Generation of Friendship'."

Morocco and Mauritania contested this position, claiming pre-existing legal links to the territories before Spanish colonization. The court had to answer whether Western Sahara was *terra nullius* at the time of Spanish colonization.

Of significant relevance is the discussion of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) advisory opinion on the Western Sahara in 1975, wherein the ICJ considered legal ties between the territory and the Kingdom of Morocco and the Mauritanian entity at the time of Spanish colonization. The document highlights how the ICJ recognized the existence of legal links of allegiance between the Sultan of Morocco and certain tribes in Western Sahara, and the existence of rights for the populations of the Mauritanian entity but deemed these insufficient to constitute territorial sovereignty. It then reflects on how the ICJ opinion, in accepting Morocco's argument for its statehood at the time of Spanish colonization, acknowledged the specificity of the Cherifian state structure. The summary describes how, by dissecting the Moroccan argumentation and focusing on the traditional three-element definition of statehood, the ICJ ultimately reinforced the primacy of the state model that underpins international law, even while recognizing some specificity in the case of the Cherifian state.",

The analysis covers interventions and debates since the 2000s. The study concludes that the parliamentary space has not been a decisive actor in this policy, caught between maintaining good relations with Morocco (as a privileged partner) and acknowledging the situation of the Sahrawi people. The document discusses parliamentary initiatives related to the Western Sahara in the Spanish Congress and Senate, including support for UN peace plans and humanitarian aid. It also addresses the position of the Andalusian Parliament, often mirroring the central government's actions, particularly regarding support for a referendum on self-determination. The document highlights how Spanish political institutions have historically prioritized the humanitarian aspects of the conflict, with local corporations playing a key role in providing aid to refugees in Tindouf. It further examines how Spain's relationship with Morocco influences its stance on the Western Sahara and the EU's role in promoting democracy in the Maghreb, noting the lack of explicit mention of Sahrawi self-determination in these democratization efforts. The paper finds the Spanish parliamentary action has largely remained neutral, avoiding measures that might weaken their ability to mediate the conflict, emphasizing the complexities of balancing relations with Morocco and supporting Sahrawi rights.",

The document also mentions peace negotiations that led to the 1988 Settlement Plan, which included a ceasefire in 1991 and a referendum on self-determination under the United Nations (MINURSO). However, the referendum was never held due to Moroccan opposition. Later, the Baker Plan I (2001) and Baker Plan II (2003) proposed provisional autonomy under Moroccan rule followed by a referendum, but these plans did not progress. The paper highlights Spain's role in providing aid to the Sahrawi refugees, emphasizing that Spain is one of the most important providers of aid. It argues that Sahrawi women have played a crucial role in maintaining social structures and advocating for the liberation and independence of Western Sahara, especially in the refugee camps and in the occupied territories, facing continuous repression. The document concludes by emphasizing the importance of recognizing women not just as victims but as active participants and strategists in the Sahrawi conflict.",

It highlights the shift in Spain's position regarding the Western Sahara, specifically the government's endorsement of Morocco's autonomy plan in March 2022 as the 'most serious, credible, and realistic' basis for resolving the conflict. This change led to improved relations with Morocco, marked by a joint declaration in April 2022 to normalize relations and plan for a High-Level Meeting in early 2023. However, this shift also caused strained relations with Algeria, including the withdrawal of their ambassador and the suspension of the Treaty of Friendship. The EU Commission considered Algeria's actions a possible violation of the Association Agreement between the EU and Algeria. The document also notes the disapproval of most parliamentary groups in the Spanish Congress regarding this shift. The document concludes by emphasizing the need for Spain to seek a new equilibrium in its relationship with both Morocco and Algeria, adhering to UN dispositions and international law, especially as the EU Court of Justice is expected to rule on the applicability of EU-Morocco trade and fishing agreements to Western Sahara resources in 2023.",

It details the historical ties between the two countries, starting from Morocco's early recognition of the U.S. independence in 1777. The analysis reveals how Morocco leveraged its strategic location and pro-Western stance to gain U.S. support. The document highlights U.S. support for Morocco in the Western Sahara conflict, particularly during the Reagan administration in the 1980s, driven by Cold War dynamics. While the U.S. never officially recognized Moroccan sovereignty over the Western Sahara, it offered political, economic, and military backing. Morocco presented its autonomy plan for the Western Sahara as the most viable solution to regional stability, particularly as a counter to potential terrorist havens. The paper also points out that the U.S. has maintained a degree of equidistance to avoid alienating Algeria, a crucial trade partner. The paper also discusses Morocco's efforts to be seen as a model for economic and political reform in the Arab world. It also mentions the FTA agreement signed in 2004.",

It explores how the Franco regime used language, particularly in speeches by prominent figures like Francisco Franco and ministers, to promote a positive image of Spanish rule and downplay the Sahrawi's right to self-determination.

It touches upon Spain's historical role as the former colonial power and mentions Spain as a relevant actor in resolving the conflict. Specifically, it highlights Spain's provision of aid through the AECID (Agencia Española de Cooperación Internacional para el Desarrollo). It mentions Spain's cooperation strategy with the Sahrawi population. The document describes the economic context of the refugee camps, including the shift from dependence on humanitarian aid to the development of private economic activities, the challenges faced by the population, and the possible future scenarios for the Western Sahara, whether as an independent state or an autonomous region within Morocco. While not its primary focus, Spain's involvement through aid and historical responsibility makes the source tangentially relevant to Spain's position on the Western Sahara conflict.",
