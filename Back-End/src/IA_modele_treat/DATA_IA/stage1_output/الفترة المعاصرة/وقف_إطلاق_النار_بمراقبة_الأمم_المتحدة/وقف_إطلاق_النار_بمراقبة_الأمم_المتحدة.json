It highlights that UN-monitored elections are often viewed as a key event in a nation's transition from civil unrest when rebel groups commit to peaceful political participation. However, the abstract also notes that the success of elections in ending civil wars depends on former belligerents cooperating and accepting the election results. The abstract further explains potential weaknesses in UN election monitoring missions which can be exploited by the conflict dynamics and frustrate the entire peace process. The chapter uses a comparative analysis of failed and partially successful election monitoring missions to identify common weaknesses and their vulnerability to conflict dynamics in contributing to different levels of failure.",

It suggests criteria for evaluating these missions, including limiting violent conflict, reducing human suffering, preventing conflict spread, and promoting conflict resolution. The article analyzes six UN peacekeeping operations: UNTAG (Namibia), ONUMOZ (Mozambique), UNAMIR (Rwanda), UNOSOM (Somalia), MINURCA (Central African Republic), and ONUB (Burundi). The evaluation considers whether the missions sustained ceasefires, reduced casualties, prevented refugee flows, and fostered a stable post-mission environment. UNTAG and ONUMOZ are classified as successes; UNAMIR and UNOSOM as failures; and MINURCA and ONUB as partial successes/failures. The article concludes that mandate implementation does not always equate to overall success, particularly regarding conflict resolution and preventing civilian massacres. It emphasizes the importance of evaluating UN Security Council decisions and the potential of UN peace operations to achieve stability.",

India also chaired the International Control Commission for Indochina in the mid-1950s, implementing cease-fire agreements. From 1960-64, India deployed troops to Congo during a crisis. Indian troops and observer groups were also sent to Yemen (1963-64), Cyprus (1964 onwards), and the Iran-Iraq border (1988-89) to monitor situations. In 1993, India contributed to the UN-negotiated peace treaty in Cambodia, including providing personnel for UN-monitored elections. In 1993-94, Indian troops aided in Somalia. As of March 2000, India also had contingents in Kuwait, Lebanon, and Sierra Leone.

The essay analyzes both the successes and failures of these operations. It examines post-Cold War peacekeeping missions involving the UN and African regional organizations, such as ECOWAS and the AU, specifically in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Darfur. It also addresses the current dilemma where capable UN peacekeepers are hesitant to engage in dangerous missions, while African peacekeepers, who are more willing, lack adequate funding and logistical support.",

It examines the logic behind arms embargoes as tools for international peacemaking and security, and then explores specific cases, including Iraq, Yugoslavia, Somalia, Libya, Liberia, Haiti, Angola/UNITA, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Ethiopia/Eritrea, Afghanistan and the Taliban. The document analyzes the challenges of enforcing arms embargoes, citing instances where they have been ineffective due to lack of commitment, enforcement mechanisms, or political will. It highlights the role of arms brokers, air transport, and falsified end-user certificates in circumventing embargoes. The study also discusses the moral and political dilemmas associated with arms embargoes, such as potentially benefiting one party in a conflict over another. The report identifies specific cases of failures and successes, suggesting improvements, such as creating a special arms embargo unit within the UN Secretariat, regulating arms brokers, and enhancing monitoring efforts. The document concludes that while arms embargoes have limitations, they can be a more effective means of international peacemaking with strengthened enforcement and a more committed international community. The role of the UN in monitoring the ceasefires or the peace agreements formed after the imposition of sanctions is also discussed.",

          "source_summary": "This article primarily focuses on the Eritrean refugee crisis, examining the reasons why Eritreans flee their country, the conditions they face in refugee camps, and potential solutions to the crisis. It discusses the political repression, indefinite national service, and economic hardships within Eritrea as major drivers of the exodus. The article highlights the experiences of Eritrean refugees in Ethiopia, Sudan, and Djibouti, noting the challenges they face, including kidnapping, human trafficking, and limited opportunities. It also touches upon the broader regional context, including the unresolved border dispute with Ethiopia, and advocates for changes within Eritrea and between Eritrea and Ethiopia to address the root causes of the refugee crisis. The article mentions a U.N.-monitored referendum in 1993 that led to Eritrea's statehood, and the 1998-2000 border war with Ethiopia, which although it ended in a truce, the underlying dispute remains unresolved, creating a 'no-peace-no-war' situation. The article directly mentions UNHCR and ARRA roles.",

It uses Intractable Conflict Theory (ICT) to analyze the intractability of civil wars and identifies factors such as natural resource exploitation, environmental degradation, third-party interventions, the presence of spoilers, undisclosed incentives, security inequality, and costly negligence/oversights in peacebuilding efforts as key reasons for conflict recurrence after a PA is signed. The paper highlights how these factors can deter belligerents from committing to peace, leading to the collapse of agreements and a return to violence. It concludes by recommending that peace agreements incorporate contingency plans to mitigate the risk of renewed conflict and emphasizes the importance of co-management strategies for natural resources to prevent them from fueling further conflict. While the paper does not focus specifically on UN-monitored ceasefires, it does broadly discuss the factors impacting the success of peace agreements which can include UN involvement.",

It discusses the fragile interdependence between Assad, Russia, and Iran, and how their competing goals affect the conflict. A key theme is the failure of the UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 2254, which calls for a ceasefire, constitutional revisions, and UN-monitored elections, to achieve meaningful progress due to Assad's intransigence and Russia's manipulation. The report details Russia's attempts to broker settlements, including the Astana Talks and Sochi Conference, and how these efforts have been undermined by Assad's actions. The analysis also extends to the de-escalation zones established in 2017 and their subsequent collapse, alongside Russia's attempts to gain access to reconstruction funds. The report concludes by arguing that the U.S. needs a new policy framework in Syria that moves beyond a near-term focus on ending violence and instead aims to keep space open for political competition, suggesting a renewed diplomatic initiative and local engagement.",

The review discusses the negotiated settlements that ended armed conflicts in Central America, particularly focusing on El Salvador's civil war (1980-1992) and the subsequent demilitarization process. The role of international actors, including the United Nations in monitoring the implementation of peace accords and sponsoring truth commissions, is highlighted. The review also compares the Salvadoran experience with those of Nicaragua and Guatemala, noting the importance of initiatives from politicians and civil society, internal changes within the military, and the role of international mediation in achieving demilitarization. The impact of the United States, particularly the pressure exerted on military officers in return for aid, and the UN's role in monitoring accords and discouraging impunity, are deemed crucial.",

The chapter also draws comparisons with Zimbabwe's experiences in reintegration and analyzes the protests by disgruntled ex-combatants in the 1990s. The Namibian government later introduced the \"Peace Project\" to provide affirmative public service job placements.

Monitoring and Surveillance Technologies in UN Peacekeeping', provides an overview of technologies used in UN peacekeeping operations, focusing on monitoring and surveillance. It begins by highlighting the UN's extensive experience in monitoring ceasefires and peace agreements, but notes the limitations of relying solely on human observers. The document argues for the integration of modern monitoring technologies to enhance the range, effectiveness, and accuracy of observation, particularly in detecting arms smuggling, protecting civilians, and improving night-time awareness. It surveys a variety of technologies, including satellite reconnaissance, cameras, motion sensors, night vision, radars, and geographic information systems, while also discussing the challenges and problems associated with their deployment. The document emphasizes that modern technology can complement and enhance human efforts, not replace them. It uses the UN operation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) as a case study, mentioning the difficulties in monitoring arms embargos and the need for aerial surveillance. Ultimately, the report makes several recommendations for the UN to improve its technological capabilities in peacekeeping, including updating policies, conducting trials, engaging troop-contributing countries, and building on existing GIS systems. It calls for a dialogue between member states and the Secretariat. The Executive Summary states 'The United Nations has more experience monitoring ceasefires and peace agreements than any other organization.' This document extensively addresses the UN's role in monitoring ceasefires, including the technologies that can be implemented for observation and verification purposes.",

The guidelines detail how to interpret Security Council demands, evaluate the timeliness and continuity of compliance, and consider the depth of the demand. It emphasizes the importance of using credible sources and documenting assessments.

It details the UN's involvement in Sierra Leone, starting with UNOMSIL in July 1998 alongside ECOMOG forces, followed by the establishment of UNAMSIL in October 1999 to take over peacekeeping duties. The chapter highlights the challenges UNAMSIL faced, including attacks by the RUF in May 2000, which led to the capture of UN peacekeepers and seizure of weapons. The UN's disarmament program was completed in January 2002, and UN-monitored elections took place in May 2002. UNAMSIL withdrew its remaining troops in December 2005, after six years of peacekeeping. The UN Security Council established UNIOSIL in January 2006 to coordinate international peace consolidation efforts, which later became UNIPSIL in October 2008. The chapter assesses the roles of domestic, subregional, and external actors in addressing peacebuilding challenges, including civil society, ECOWAS, the UN, and bilateral donors. It notes the limitations of international assistance and the importance of local ownership in rebuilding the state. UNIPSIL left Sierra Leone in March 2014, marking the end of a 16-year UN presence. The chapter concludes by emphasizing the need for sustained resources to transform Sierra Leonean society.",

The UN intervention involved organizing elections and establishing a power-sharing coalition between the former communist regime and the anti-communist FUNCINPEC. The chapter includes quotes from Asda Jayanama, Thailand’s UN Ambassador (1996–2001), emphasizing ASEAN's active role in shaping Cambodia's state and conditions, and from Ali Alatas, Indonesian Foreign Minister (1988–98), reflecting Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen's initial resistance to foreign interference.",

Franck discusses the evolution of democratic entitlement in international law. It touches upon various aspects of UN involvement in international affairs, including UN observer missions. Specifically, the article notes that as part of a cease-fire package, the UN observer mission in Angola (UNAVEM) oversaw the withdrawal of Cuban troops. The article analyzes the legitimacy of governments stemming from the will of the people and the legitimating power of the community of nations. It also lists several countries that, as of 1990, made legal provisions for multiparty, secret-ballot elections.",

It details the historical context of the conflict, the various international and domestic factors influencing events, and the effectiveness (or lack thereof) of air operations. Key aspects covered include the UN's role, NATO's involvement, the dynamics between different ethnic groups, economic sanctions, and the evolving military situation on the ground. The study evaluates the effectiveness of the international monitoring of the conflict, and the air strikes that served to enforce various UN resolutions.",
          "extracted_key_facts": [
            "Operation Deny Flight began on April 12, 1993, as NATO's response to UN Security Council Resolution 816, which banned unauthorized flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina.",
            "The initial objective of Operation Deny Flight was to monitor and enforce compliance with UNSCR 816, aiming to stabilize the situation in Bosnia for a peaceful settlement.",
            "By July 1995, nearly 6000 apparent violations of the no-fly zone over Bosnia-Herzegovina were documented by NATO.",
            "UNSCR 836, passed on June 4, 1993, directed NATO to provide close air support (CAS) in and around the safe areas to support UNPROFOR in the performance of its mandate which was to deter attacks, monitor ceasefires, and use force to ensure freedom of movement for UNPROFOR.",
            "On February 28, 1994, NATO F-16s shot down four Serb aircraft in its first-ever combat engagement, as part of Operation Deny Flight.",
            "Operation Deliberate Force began on August 30, 1995, with NATO air strikes against targets in southeast Bosnia-Herzegovina, aiming to halt attacks on UN-designated safe areas.",
            "On September 14, 1995, NATO suspended Operation Deliberate Force after Bosnian Serb forces largely complied with UN demands regarding attacks on safe areas and the removal of heavy weapons from the Sarajevo exclusion zone.",
            "The UN's original monitoring and intervention was prompted by the Serb attacks on Croat territory, which led to the deployment of UNPROFOR soldiers in February 1992 under UN Security Council Resolution 743.",
            "The author argues that the Bosnian war was a civil war with Muslims, Serbs, and Croats all fighting for ultimate political control, with Yugoslavia, Croatia, and an Islamic coalition as major external actors.",
            "The Vance-Owen Peace Plan, which divided Bosnia-Herzegovina into 10 cantons, was opposed by the US because it ceded land gained by the Bosnian Serbs through 'acts of aggression'.",
            "The UN declared six areas (Sarajevo, Tuzla, Gorazde, Bihac, Zepa, and Srebrenica) as safe areas, free from hostile acts which endangered the inhabitant’s safety.",
            "On April 10, 1994, NATO fighters dropped bombs for the first time in alliance history on a Serb mobile command post and a tank shelling the town of Gorazde.",
            "The US negotiated an agreement between the Croats and Muslims to link their armies and territories together in early 1994.",
            "The Balkan Contact Group, formed in April 1994, focused on persuading the Serbs to give up approximately 20 percent of the territory they controlled.",
            "In August 1994, Milosevic broke relations with the Bosnian Serbs, which led to the UN lifting some of the embargoes against Serbia.",
            "In November 1994, UNSCR 958 increased the UN mandate to protect UNPROFOR in Croatia as well as in Bosnia and set the stage for NATO to strike Udbina directly to compel the Serbs to quit using that airfield for offensive operations.",
            "UNPROFOR soldiers were used as human shields to deter NATO strikes against the Bosnian Serbs.",
            "By the end of August 1995, the number of UNPROFOR soldiers on the ground in Bosnia had also been reduced from over 20,000 personnel in May to approximately 4,000 personnel, now deployed in better defensive positions.",
            "Lt Gen Michael Ryan, the combined forces air component commander developed the planned air operation objective to: 'Execute a robust NATO air operation that adversely alters the BSA’s advantage in conducting successful military operations against the BIH.'"

The paper discusses the attempts at peace facilitated by the UN (UNAVEM I, II, III and MONUA), the reasons for their failure, including inadequate mandates and resources, unrealistic timeframes, and the UN's perceived lack of impartiality. It addresses the political war economy driven by oil and diamonds, UNITA's return to guerrilla warfare, the MPLA's search for military victory and political legitimacy, Angola's regional relations, and the growth of civil society. The paper concludes with recommendations to bolster the achievement of peace in Angola, including a more proactive role for civil society and a more assertive position by the international community, suggesting that the resolution of the conflict cannot be left solely to the belligerents.

Pazzanita, published in The Journal of Modern African Studies in March 1991, examines the dynamics that fueled the prolonged war in Angola and the steps towards eventual settlement. It highlights the roles of Cuba, South Africa, the Soviet Union, and the United States in the conflict and peace process. The article also considers the influence of East-West relations, the internal situation in Angola, and South Africa's occupation of Namibia on the overall environment. While the article doesn't explicitly detail the United Nations' monitoring role during ceasefires, it discusses the broader context of conflict resolution in Angola, which often involved international actors and potential ceasefire agreements. The references listed also may refer to information regarding UN involvement in Angola.",

            "The conflict began moving towards eventual settlement in the mid-1980s.",
            "In August 1987, President dos Santos stated that the conflict since 1975 had cost the country over 60,000 lives and had inflicted $12,000 million in damage.",
            "A 1987 UNICEF report stated that one-tenth of Angolans were homeless, tens of thousands died of starvation each year, and 150,000 refugees had fled to neighboring countries as a result of the Angolan conflict.",
            "There were approximately 35,000 to 37,000 Cuban troops in Angola at some point during the conflict, as stated by Zartman.",
            "In 1988, South African shelling of Cuito Cuanavale had fallen to a desultory 40 rounds per day.",

It examines the mission's role in halting violent conflict and promoting conflict resolution in the context of the Western Sahara dispute between Morocco and the POLISARIO Front. The paper analyzes the historical background of the conflict, the establishment of MINURSO in 1991 to supervise a ceasefire and organize a referendum for self-determination, and the mission's subsequent challenges and failures. The author argues that MINURSO has primarily functioned as a conflict stabilizer, maintaining the ceasefire, but has been unsuccessful in implementing other aspects of its mandate, such as the return of refugees, exchange of prisoners of war, and the organization of the referendum. The paper contends that the UN's peacemaking efforts have been constrained by Morocco's influence, supported by powerful members of the Security Council, and that MINURSO has not been able to promote transformative conflict resolution. It further suggests that MINURSO's operations have been influenced by Western policies of conflict containment and the promotion of stability in the region, potentially hindering the mission's ability to address the underlying issues of the conflict and ensure the self-determination of the Saharan people. The paper also explores the potential of using critical theory to analyze the dynamics of power and knowledge within the conflict and peacekeeping process.",

The chapter explores the historical context of the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, covering topics such as the initial Soviet intervention, the shift towards diplomatic solutions, Gorbachev's approach to the Afghanistan issue, the National Reconciliation Campaign, engagement with the United States, the withdrawal of the Soviet army, debates within the Politburo, and Soviet policy during the withdrawal. The text details the political and diplomatic events, including engagement with Americans, related to the Soviet departure from Afghanistan. While it doesn't explicitly mention the direct monitoring of a ceasefire by the UN, the book broadly deals with the environment in which such a ceasefire might have taken place. It discusses the Soviet withdrawal process which led to the need for such agreements and possible UN monitoring.",

The text describes the initial acceptance and subsequent violations of the Rogers Plan's ceasefire agreement. It mentions the role of the UN's envoy, Jarring, in attempts to mediate between Egypt and Israel, and the eventual failure of his mission. It also covers the international initiatives, including the \"concertation à quatre\" involving France, Great Britain, the US, and the Soviet Union, and the OAU's efforts at mediation, both of which failed to achieve a lasting peace. It highlights the changing political landscape in Egypt and Syria under Presidents Sadat and Assad, respectively, and the increasing intransigence of Israeli leadership.

It examines the evolution of UN peacekeeping operations (OMP), highlighting the shift from traditional inter-state conflicts to internal conflicts and the increased authorization for the use of force by peacekeepers. The article also addresses the limitations and challenges faced by OMPs, such as insufficient mandates, heterogeneous troop contributions, inadequate equipment, and funding constraints. Furthermore, it explores the UN's practice of outsourcing the use of force to member states in situations involving serious human rights violations. The article mentions specific UN missions like ONUST, MONUG, UNMOGIP, MINUK, UNFICYP, MINUSIL, FNUOD, FINUL, MINUEE, MONUC, MONUIK, MANUTO, MINURSO, and MINUCI which are directly related to the concept of truce supervision.",

The text includes bibliographic information, citation formats, and purchasing options for the chapter and the entire book. It also presents a quote from Evan Luard, an historian of the UN, offering a critical view of the UN's role and effectiveness during the 1945-1955 period. Luard argues the UN failed to act as a center for harmonizing national efforts because it was mainly used as a public forum for debate and condemnation rather than negotiation and conciliation. The text, therefore, discusses the United Nations' involvement in security matters, a function which includes the monitoring of ceasefires.",

Stabilization, according to the UN, involves military, security, and civilian measures to support former belligerents in implementing peace agreements and halting collective violence. The document details the different phases of conflict, the UN's peacekeeping operations (traditional, multidimensional, and transitional administration), and the importance of a negotiated agreement for successful stabilization. It also highlights the distinction between stabilization and peacebuilding, with the former preceding the latter. The document uses the Multinational Force & Observers (MFO) in the Sinai as an example of stabilization between states and the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUC) as an example of stabilization within a state. The analysis concludes by emphasizing the necessity of local agreement, a well-organized deployment of resources, and long-term planning for successful stabilization efforts by the UN.",

It examines the reasons for the initial failures of UNIFIL, the political and military reinforcements implemented under UN Security Council Resolution 1701, and the fragile status quo that exists between Lebanon and Israel. The article highlights the difficulties UNIFIL faces in implementing its mandate due to persistent divergences between the conflicting parties, the ambiguous status of Hezbollah in Lebanese politics, and the implications of the Special Tribunal for Lebanon. Despite these challenges, the article concludes that a reinforced UNIFIL has achieved some satisfactory results but needs continuous adaptation and diplomatic efforts to maintain peace. The article provides a historical context and analysis of the UNIFIL mission and its role in maintaining the ceasefire between Lebanon and Israel.",

It critiques the militarization of humanitarian aid and the negative consequences of the UN's actions, including violence against civilians and the undermining of local reconciliation efforts. It details the initial hopes for the intervention, the subsequent disillusionment, and the author's concerns about the use of force in the name of humanitarianism. The text also mentions the initial efforts of ambassador Mohammed Sahnoun and his unsuccessful attempts to establish ceasefires, as well as the eventual ineffectiveness and violence associated with UN peacekeeping operations during the intervention. The article analyzes the events leading up to, during, and immediately following the United Nations intervention in Somalia, shedding light on how a humanitarian effort was influenced and marred by the realities of warfare. It critically examines the UN's strategy, its impact on the Somali population, and the paradoxes inherent in using military force for humanitarian purposes. It argues that the intervention's militaristic approach ultimately exacerbated the conflict and undermined the potential for long-term stability. The article recounts numerous events, including violence against civilians, the assassination of aid workers, and the destruction of humanitarian facilities. It questions the effectiveness of UN peacekeeping operations and expresses concern about the potential for the UN to legitimize warlords and perpetuate cycles of violence. Overall, the text provides a critical analysis of the UN's role in the Somali intervention, focusing on the consequences of using military force in humanitarian efforts and highlighting the challenges of establishing peace and stability in a conflict-ridden environment.",

It assesses the successes, failures, costs (financial and human), and the overall impact of these missions. It highlights the increasing number of UN peacekeeping missions in Africa since 1992, examining specific operations like ONUSOM I & II in Somalia, MINUAR I & II in Rwanda, UNAVEM I, II, III and MONUA in Angola, MINURCAT in Chad-RCA, and MONUC/MONUSCO in the DRC. The paper also analyzes successes such as UN missions in Sierra Leone (MINUSIL) and Mozambique (ONUMOZ). The study emphasizes the need for Africa to be more involved in conflict resolution and for the UN to adapt its strategies, including strengthening peacebuilding components, cooperation with regional organizations like the African Union, and providing missions with robust mandates under Chapter VII of the UN Charter. The document also addresses the need for better-trained personnel and improved ethical conduct within UN peacekeeping forces. The paper concludes that the UN continues to play an important role in the maintenance of peace, but the missions deployed in Africa need to evolve and become more relevant to local realities.",

It details the diplomatic efforts leading to the Bonn Agreement, the initial reluctance of various Afghan factions (especially the Northern Alliance) to accept an international security presence, and the compromises that led to the creation of ISAF. The text highlights the challenges faced by ISAF in establishing its role, coordinating with local forces, and expanding its operations beyond Kabul. It also addresses the differing views among international actors (US, UK, Germany, Turkey) regarding ISAF's size, mandate, and relationship to the US-led Operation Enduring Freedom. The document outlines the Military Technical Agreement (AMT) that defined ISAF's mission and limitations, and the subsequent transitions in command from the UK to Germany and then to Turkey. The analysis points out that ISAF served more as a \"presence mission\" providing limited stability in Kabul rather than a robust peacekeeping force. It covers the period from September 11, 2001, through the middle of 2003, examining the political and security context in which ISAF operated and the difficulties in establishing a stable and representative government in Afghanistan.",

Instead, the conflict ended in a ceasefire similar to the 2012 ceasefire after Operation Pillar of Defense, with the primary condition being to continue the talks. The article describes the ceasefire as coming about because Netanyahu eventually agreed to a ceasefire without conditions despite the discovery of Hamas's tunnels. The article provides a detailed account of the events leading up to the war, the military operations, the political context, and the consequences for both Israelis and Palestinians.

It examines the UN's role in maintaining peace, the challenges faced, and the different outcomes in each country. In Rwanda, the article describes the UN's attempt to guarantee the Arusha Accords, the difficulties in deploying and implementing the mission, and the eventual failure to prevent the Rwandan genocide. In the Central African Republic, the article details the UN's involvement in supporting the Bangui Accords, the successful transition from the MISAB force to MINURCA, and the overall positive impact on the country's stability and democratic processes, leading to the creation of BONUCA. The article contrasts the failure in Rwanda, attributed to a lack of cooperation from the Rwandan parties and the UN mission's limited mandate, with the success in the Central African Republic, due to the cooperation of the Centrafrican parties, and a well-defined mandate. The article considers how UN interventions evolve over time to adapt to different situations in Africa. It emphasizes that the success or failure of peacekeeping operations depends on the willingness of conflicting parties to cooperate and the UN's ability to adapt its strategies.",

The crisis was triggered by Iraq's suspension of cooperation with UNSCOM and the expulsion of American inspectors, leading to a build-up of US military forces in the Persian Gulf. An agreement was reached on February 23, 1998, between the UN Secretary-General and the Iraqi government, but the underlying issues remained unresolved. The US policy of containment, including economic sanctions and forced disarmament under UNSCOM supervision, is examined. The article highlights the tensions between the US and other members of the UN Security Council, particularly regarding the lifting of sanctions. The role of UNSCOM, its structure, and the controversy surrounding its operations are discussed extensively. The article also explores the diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis, including the mission of UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the involvement of Russia and France. The analysis concludes that the crisis exposed the limitations of US unilateralism and the need for a multilateral approach to the Iraq issue.",

It examines the complexities and challenges of NATO's involvement, particularly its logistical support, training assistance, and coordination with the European Union and the United Nations. The document also delves into the strategic implications of NATO's expanding role in Africa, including energy security, migration, and the fight against terrorism. It analyzes the effectiveness and limitations of AMIS, suggesting that a more robust international commitment, potentially involving a NATO-led peacekeeping force and the establishment of a no-fly zone, is needed to stabilize the region. The paper covers the period from 2004, when the AU first engaged, to late 2007.",

The review emphasizes that DDR has become integral to peace agreements and addresses the needs for reconstruction, reconciliation, and peace consolidation. It also touches on the prerequisites for successful DDR programs, such as the consent of parties, trust, and long-term planning, as well as the challenges of managing DDR in impoverished areas and the risk of relapse into violence. The review further breaks down the components of disarmament (weapon surveys, collection, storage, destruction, and redistribution) and demobilization (planning, regrouping, registration, disarmament, orientation, and reintegration into civilian life). Finally, it insists that DDR should begin during peace negotiations, taking into account legal frameworks, good governance, security sector reform, and links to development cooperation.

The article references the UN's MINUAR mission and the Security Council resolutions related to the conflict, highlighting the debate surrounding the use of Chapter VII of the UN Charter and the Operation Turquoise authorized under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, and the United Nations Tribunal Penal International for Rwanda.

The document also discusses the differing approaches of the United Nations and the African Union to peacekeeping, and emphasizes the need for better strategies for entering and exiting conflict zones, and prioritizing operations to support effective peace processes.

It identifies three main issues: overly broad mandates that are open to interpretation, limited capabilities of troop contingents, and poor coordination on the ground. The document highlights how these factors impede the missions' ability to achieve desired outcomes, such as protecting civilians and supporting political processes. It also examines the composition of peacekeeping forces, noting a disproportionate number of troops from countries with low to medium Human Development Index (HDI) scores. It concludes by suggesting potential solutions, including simplifying UN mandates, enhancing training, increasing contributions from developed countries, and improving interoperability among contingents.

It details the events leading up to the conflict, including the kidnapping of three Israeli teenagers by Hamas in June 2014, the subsequent Israeli military operations, and the ongoing rocket attacks from Gaza into Israel. It examines claims and counter-claims related to ceasefire attempts, civilian casualties, and proportionality of force, including accusations against Hamas for using human shields and targeting civilians, and against Israel for disproportionate responses. It also discusses the various attempts at ceasefires during the conflict, the roles of Egypt and other international actors in mediating these ceasefires, and the eventual acceptance of a truce by Hamas after multiple violations. The document critiques the UN's involvement and the biased reporting of international organizations and media outlets.

It emphasizes that these operations take place on the ground and involve armed military forces from national contingents. The article highlights the ad hoc, spatial, and temporal nature of OMPs, noting that they are designed for specific times and places. The author argues that the multiplication, diversification, and use of force within OMPs, particularly in the post-Cold War context (specifically mentioning 200,000 deaths in the former Yugoslavia in the past two years), underscore the increasing importance and complexity of these operations. The article also references the UN Secretary-General's \"Agenda for Peace,\" which defines peacekeeping as establishing a UN presence on the ground.",

The resolution created ONUSAL to monitor the agreements between the government of El Salvador and the Frente Farabundo Martí para la Liberación Nacional (FMLN), initially focusing on human rights. The text provides background on the Salvadoran Civil War (1980-1992) and the UN's involvement in the peace process, including the roles of Alvaro de Soto as mediator and the evolution of ONUSAL's mandate to encompass cease-fire monitoring, demobilization, police reform, electoral observation, and addressing illegal armed groups. The document details the progressive expansion of ONUSAL's functions through subsequent resolutions, its structure, and its perceived success as a peacekeeping operation, while also acknowledging the limitations and context-specific nature of the mission's success. The analysis explores the UN's active role in the negotiations, the support from various international actors, and the shift in priorities from human rights to military and police reforms during the implementation of the peace accords. It also discusses the innovative aspects of the resolution, such as intervening without a prior peace agreement and the flexible adaptation of the mission to the evolving context, while also cautioning against oversimplifying the reasons for the peace process's success.",

The paper discusses the role of the UN mission (MONUC), its \"congolization\" and ineffectiveness, the proliferation of regional dialogue mechanisms, the uncoordinated efforts of international aid, and the re-emergence of military options.

It details how the veto can hinder the resolution of conflicts and provides examples of vetoes used on resolutions concerning various global issues, including situations related to ceasefires and UN observer missions.

While the article does not explicitly mention UN-monitored ceasefires, it discusses agreements, including the Shakai agreement of April 24, 2004, brokered between the Pakistani army and militants in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), which can be seen as a localized ceasefire agreement. The article also examines the complex relationship between the Pakistani government, the ISI, the Taliban, and al-Qaeda after 9/11, particularly focusing on the support provided to the Taliban leadership after their escape from Afghanistan, and the agreements to try to keep the peace. It highlights the ISI's role in providing asylum to Taliban leaders after they fled Afghanistan and the ISI's double game of protecting the Taliban while simultaneously providing assistance to the US in capturing al-Qaeda members. It details various agreements and ceasefires that the Pakistani army has signed with the Islamist groups in the FATA that ultimately ended in failure and increased support for the Taliban and Al-Qaeda. The article concludes by stating that there was a ceasefire between the army and the Mehsud in April 2008 without any allusions to stopping attacks in Afghanistan.",

It discusses the Secretary-General's political functions as defined by the UN Charter, including the power to bring matters to the Security Council's attention (Article 99), and the evolution of the office through the tenures of Lie, Dag Hammarskjöld, U Thant, Kurt Waldheim and Javier Pérez de Cuéllar. The text specifically details significant involvements of the Secretary-General in international crises, such as the Korean War, the Suez Crisis, the Congo crisis, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Middle East situation and the Falklands/Malvinas conflict. It analyzes the contrasting approaches and interpretations of the role by different Secretaries-General and the challenges they faced in balancing the interests of the international community with the need to maintain the confidence of major powers. The document also explores the process of electing the Secretary-General and the political considerations involved, including instances of vetoes and compromises among member states. Key aspects include the Secretary-General's function as mediator, advisor, and implementer of UN resolutions, often involving peacekeeping forces and ceasefire arrangements in conflict zones. The case of the Falkland Islands conflict under Pérez de Cuéllar shows direct involvement in ceasefire negotiations and efforts to achieve diplomatic resolutions.",

It analyses the interests of key actors like the Colombian government, the FARC, the ELN, the AUC, the US, and the UN, examining their stances on negotiation and potential international involvement. It assesses different scenarios for the conflict's resolution, including military victory by either side, indefinite prolongation of the war, or a negotiated distribution of power, and considers the likelihood of UN peacekeeping intervention under each scenario and its potential duration, drawing comparisons with Central American peace processes.",

It highlights Argentina's involvement in operations since 1958, the economic and human costs, and the need for a legal framework that protects national interests and the safety of Argentine personnel. The document also examines the role of the International Criminal Court and its potential impact on peace operations, advocating for better training and awareness among Argentine troops. It emphasizes that Argentina should consider its national interests when deciding to participate in peace operations, particularly those related to Chapter VII of the UN Charter, and that Argentine forces should be adequately armed. The paper argues that Argentina has had a significant involvement in various UN peacekeeping operations since the late 1950s, starting with UNOGIL in Lebanon, and highlights the country's contributions to missions such as UNPROFOR in Yugoslavia and others in Cyprus and Kuwait. However, it stresses the lack of a comprehensive legal framework in Argentina to guide these involvements, leading to potential risks and insufficient protection for Argentine personnel.",

It details the involvement of international actors such as the United Nations (UN) and the Organization of American States (OAS) in peace processes in countries like Nicaragua and El Salvador in the 1990s, where they performed multifaceted peace operations involving conflict mediation, ceasefire verification, election monitoring, and disarmament. The document also outlines the limitations of international intervention, particularly in addressing issues like drug trafficking and new forms of internal violence, and compares successful multilateral peace operations with less effective approaches to combat drug-related violence. The shift from unilateral U.S. intervention under the Monroe Doctrine to multilateral approaches involving the UN and OAS is emphasized, along with the challenges faced by these organizations in promoting democracy and maintaining peace in the region. Specific UN missions like ONUSAL and ONUCA are highlighted for their roles in El Salvador and Nicaragua.",

It analyzes various proposals and obstacles to such an agreement, including legal frameworks, political will, and the roles of different actors like the government, guerrilla groups (FARC), and international organizations such as the UN. The author argues that a humanitarian agreement is possible and necessary, even without a formal peace process, and that it could lead to de-escalation of violence and future negotiations. The article also covers the potential role of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in supervising such agreements, and the applicability of Article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions. The article mentions a proposal by the government in August 2004 to release 50 imprisoned guerrillas and various internal and external pressures contributing to the proporsal, including pressure from the UN and the European Parliament.",

It discusses the historical context of financing crises, particularly those related to UNEF I and ONUC, and the subsequent development of a system for financing OMP. The piece also examines the complexities and problems associated with OMP financing, such as the variability in costs, indirect costs, and delays in contributions. Finally, it touches on Mexico's role in financing OMP and proposes ways to improve the organization and effectiveness of these operations.

It begins by establishing the UN's foundation in 1946 after World War II with the goal of maintaining international peace and security. Ten years later, the first armed PKO was deployed to Egypt to resolve the conflict between Israeli and Egyptian forces. The document highlights how Cold War politics influenced PKOs, as they required the implicit support of both Western and Eastern powers due to veto power in the Security Council. The end of the Cold War in 1989 led to a surge in intra-state conflicts, and subsequent UN PKOs often failed due to a lack of political support. This prompted UN investigations, including the Brahimi Report, leading to improvements like the Capstone Doctrine published by the Department of Peace Keeping Operations (DPKO). The document discusses the rising costs of violence to the global economy and argues for enhanced cooperation between regional organizations and the UN for future peacekeeping efforts, emphasizing the UN's neutrality.",

It highlights the need for advanced monitoring technologies to improve the safety and effectiveness of peacekeeping missions. The document details the shortcomings of relying solely on human observers and traditional methods, particularly in complex, multidimensional operations. It explores various technologies like surveillance systems, radar, and night vision equipment that can enhance monitoring capabilities and prevent atrocities. It analyzes the legal, political, institutional, cultural, and financial challenges in adopting these technologies. The document also offers recommendations for integrating appropriate technologies into UN policies, doctrines, and training programs to improve situational awareness and protect personnel. The document ultimately advocates for a more proactive approach to peacekeeping, utilizing technology to prevent conflicts and ensure sustainable peace, and mentions several UN missions by name.",

            "New mandates such as state-building and preventing civil wars required more than simple human observation.",
            "Member states and UN authorities hesitated to invest in observation technologies due to various reasons analyzed later in the document.",
            "Western nations, seeking better situational awareness, increasingly turned to technologically advanced organizations like NATO for 'harder' peacekeeping tasks after 1995.",
            "The UN's communication systems have evolved, but monitoring and surveillance technologies have lagged behind commercial sensor advancements.",
            "High-resolution satellite imagery, readily available through services like Google Earth, has not been consistently employed by the UN in real-time operations.",
            "Other organizations like NATO and the EU adopted advanced technologies more readily in peace support operations.",
            "The UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) has a world-class communication system but lacks similar advancements in observation capabilities.",
            "The UN's equipment manual includes 34 communication technologies but only six inadequately described monitoring technologies.",
            "Modern militaries recognize the importance of new technologies in enhancing alertness, speed, and precision, emphasizing command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, supervision, and reconnaissance (C4ISRY4).",
            "Romeo Dallaire, commander in Rwanda in 1994, lamented being 'deaf and blind' due to a lack of technology, hindering early warning and response to the genocide.",
            "Between 1996 and the time of writing, an estimated three to four million people died in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with the UN unable to consistently track refugee movements or prevent the import of illegal arms.",
            "In 2005 and 2006, the Special Committee on Peacekeeping (C-34) urged the DPKO to consider monitoring technologies.",
            "A 2006 C-34 report emphasized the need for the DPKO to examine technical monitoring, particularly aerial monitoring capabilities, to ensure the safety of UN peacekeepers.",
            "The Secretary-General was requested to present a comprehensive assessment, leading to the commissioning of a study on high-tech monitoring in January 2007.",
            "The C-34 welcomed the study and acknowledged the urgency of standardizing advanced technologies, requesting the Secretariat to develop modalities for their use.",
            "Monitoring is a fundamental function of all peacekeeping operations, observing cease-fire lines, demilitarized zones, borders, protected areas, and various activities such as disarmament, elections, and human rights.",
            "OMPs also maintain constant alertness regarding conditions of UN camps, threats to supply routes, and potential risks from criminal elements or natural disasters.",
            "Over 2,000 people have died in OMPs since 1948, with accidents accounting for the largest percentage of fatalities (40%), followed by malicious acts (30%) and illness (24%).",
            "The UN lacks a routine operational night capability, leaving it 'blind' for 12 hours out of the day and giving aggressor forces a large window of opportunity.",
            "The existence of large quantities of arms in OMP areas requires efforts to monitor and enforce arms embargos, as well as implement disarmament programs.",
            "Aerial reconnaissance offers numerous benefits compared to ground reconnaissance, but only a few OMPs have utilized aircraft for observation, missing opportunities for information advantage.",
            "Robust operations require precise intelligence on the location, structure, and weaponry of units, as well as complex factors like local support, intentions, and the potential use of human shields.",
            "Joint Operations Centers (JOC) and Joint Mission Analysis Centers (JMAC) are required components for all OMPs, representing opportunities for including experts in the analysis of monitoring technologies.",
            "The lack of clear guidelines for selecting appropriate technologies, considering operational, legal, political, institutional, cultural, and financial factors, presents a significant challenge for the UN.",
            "Since local laws may sometimes include prohibitions on monitoring or military activities, there might be a legal dilemma, but the UN's Office of Legal Affairs has not encountered such problems.",
            "The UN respects human rights legislation, which includes provisions regarding individual privacy, so the UN must avoid arbitrary interference with individuals' privacy, family, home, or correspondence.",
            "Because OMPs are primarily designed to achieve political outcomes, political considerations play an important role in selecting technologies and methods for employment.",
            "Some troop-contributing countries might not want to see the number of peacekeepers on the ground decrease, fearing that technology will lead to staff reductions.",
            "The UN is currently lacking the necessary equipment, resources, preparation and training for the effective and efficient use of modern monitoring technologies, depending instead on obsolete or primitive methods and instruments.",

The article examines various legal categories that can give binding force to peace agreements, including treaties between states and insurgent groups, treaties signed by states and third parties, special humanitarian accords, resolutions of the UN Security Council, and unilateral state declarations. The authors propose the concept of \"pacigerancia,\" which grants insurgent groups legal standing to negotiate and sign peace agreements with the same rights and duties as states, allowing these agreements to be recognized as binding treaties.

It details the involvement of the UNIFIL (United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon), the multinational peacekeeping force, and its mandate. The text explains the complex political landscape of Lebanon, the role of the OLP, the Syrian intervention, and the Israeli invasion. It further describes the military operations, the air battle in the Bekaa Valley, the siege of Beirut, and the emergence of Hezbollah. It highlights the international condemnation of Israel's actions and the eventual withdrawal of the OLP under the supervision of a multinational force. The text also explores the evolution of warfare, focusing on electronic warfare and the impact of new technologies. The source argues that the Israeli victory was tactical but strategically a defeat, leading to the rise of Hezbollah and continued instability. The involvement of UNIFIL in trying to create a ceasefire is noted, though it is deemed not wholly successful.",

            "Israel launched Operation Peace for Galilee on June 6, 1982, in response to an assassination attempt on the Israeli ambassador to the UK.",

The resolution expresses the Security Council's willingness to address situations where civilians are targeted and humanitarian assistance is obstructed, and its readiness to consider how peacekeeping mandates can more effectively address the negative effects of armed conflict on civilians. It requests the Secretary-General to ensure that UN personnel involved in peace operations are appropriately trained in international humanitarian law, human rights law, and refugee law. It also highlights the impact of small arms and landmines on civilians and the importance of their control/destruction.

It details commitments to human rights, strengthening human rights institutions, combating impunity, and ensuring freedoms. A key aspect is the agreement to request the United Nations Secretary-General to organize a human rights verification mission as part of the overall peace agreement. The UN mission's functions include receiving and investigating human rights violation reports, ensuring national investigations are carried out effectively, and making recommendations. It also emphasizes the need for cooperation with national institutions and the importance of addressing the situation of vulnerable groups affected by the armed conflict. The agreement specifies the mission's powers, including freedom of movement and access to information. The mission's initial duration is one year, with the possibility of renewal. It is notable that human rights verification would begin before the final peace agreement due to the recognized need for strengthening national institutions. Both parties commit to supporting the mission and ensuring the safety of its members.",

It traces the conflict's origins to the brutal repression of pro-democracy movements in March 2011, the rise of the Free Syrian Army, and the subsequent involvement of regional powers and extremist groups like Daesh and Al-Nusra. The memo highlights the humanitarian crisis, including a massive refugee flow and the spread of diseases. It examines the limited response of Western countries, the failure of the Geneva I and II conferences to achieve a political resolution, and the complexities of the situation on the ground involving numerous rebel militias and the intervention of actors like Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey. It also analyzes the roles of external actors such as the EU, the US, and Russia. The document proposes a series of recommendations for resolving the conflict, including defeating Daesh, establishing a transitional government, coordinating international efforts, and initiating a new Geneva conference. It also mentions Staffan de Mistura's plan, presented to the UN Security Council in July, to establish air exclusion zones and humanitarian corridors. The recommendations emphasize the need for a realistic sequence of actions and learning from the mistakes made in past conflicts like those in Iraq, Libya, and Yemen, especially the need for UN oversight, and avoiding sectarian-based power structures.",
