          "source_summary": "This document is a thesis investigating Morocco's sovereignty over Western Sahara from a Human Security perspective, utilizing the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) theory. The thesis analyzes the human security situation both within Western Sahara and in the Tindouf refugee camps in Algeria, considering whether Morocco's actions and inactions compromise its claim to sovereignty. The study examines the suppression of association and organization, arrests and torture, and other human rights violations in Western Sahara, as well as food insecurity and environmental threats in the Tindouf camps. It also considers the analytical range of Human Security when evaluating sovereignty, specifically whether to include the refugee camps in the analysis. Ultimately, the thesis concludes that while the situation in Western Sahara alone might not be severe enough to invalidate Moroccan sovereignty, the combined situation in Western Sahara and the Tindouf refugee camps could justify challenging Morocco's claim based on the R2P theory and Human Security principles. It does not directly mention US recognition of Moroccan sovereignty, but it provides context on the nature of the claim, its challenges, and human rights issues that underlie the debate.",

It examines Western Sahara's claim to sovereignty, the conflict with Morocco, the role of the Polisario Front and the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR). The paper explores the competing interests of various actors, including Morocco, Algeria, the Arab League, the African Union, and Western nations like the United States, and how these interests affect the international community's stance on Western Sahara. The US is identified as a key player, with its support for Morocco as an ally influencing its stance on the Western Sahara dispute and limiting recognition of the SADR. The study identifies the SADR as a partially recognized sovereign state due to conflicting forces in the entity's foreign relations. While realist policies by Algeria and Libya supported the Sahrawi movement to weaken Morocco, Morocco is a key ally to NATO countries and the US, maintaining the area in a stasis of disputed territory. The paper argues that American core interests are a deciding factor in maintaining the disputed status of the territory.",

            "The Polisario Front proclaimed the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) as an independent country in Western Sahara.",
            "A ceasefire in 1991 left the SADR and Morocco as the sole claimants, splitting the territory with Morocco occupying the west and the SADR the east, separated by a wall built by Morocco.",
            "Morocco identifies Western Sahara as part of a \"greater Morocco\" theory, while the Sahrawis seek a democratic referendum based on a voter list of 85,000 people.",
            "The UN views Western Sahara as a non-decolonized territory, not granting full sovereignty to Morocco but not explicitly legitimizing the SADR.",
            "Forty-nine countries, all in the developing world, recognize the SADR as a sovereign state.",
            "Algeria, Morocco’s traditional rival, recognizes Sahrawi sovereignty.",

            "The UN notes that both sides have influential backers, but American core interests keep the area in a stasis of disputed territory.",
            "The ceasefire agreed upon has the objective of eventually hosting a referendum, but no move has been agreed upon by both sides, leaving the territory victim to a frozen conflict."

It argues that increased US military and political activity in the region since 2003 has hindered bilateral cooperation, strengthened authoritarian governments, and inspired anti-US sentiment. The thesis examines the historical context of Algeria and Morocco, including the Western Sahara conflict and their relations with the US. It delves into the terrorist threat in the region, focusing on groups like the GSPC and GICM, and their ties to Al-Qaeda. The thesis further analyzes the US's counterterrorism strategy in North Africa, including initiatives like the Pan-Sahel Initiative (PSI), the Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership (TSCTP), and the establishment of AFRICOM. While the document does not directly focus on the US recognition of Moroccan sovereignty over the Western Sahara, it discusses the US relationship with Morocco and Algeria in relation to the Western Sahara conflict and how this relationship impacts counterterrorism efforts and democratization efforts.",

            "The increased US involvement coincided with peaking calls for democratization in Algeria and Morocco, which the author argues has been negatively impacted.",
            "The paper mentions that the Sahrawi nationalist movement in Morocco had come to rely almost exclusively on non-violent protests for self-determination by the early 2000s.",
            "The Western Sahara conflict between Morocco and the Algerian-backed Polisario Front is a key point of contention, preventing unified regional action.",
            "The US has historically been ambivalent towards the Maghreb, but post-9/11, Morocco's cooperation in the GWOT led to a Free Trade Agreement in 2004.",
            "In April 2007, the US supported Morocco's proposal to give the Western Sahara \"meaningful autonomy\" under Moroccan sovereignty, despite it lacking a referendum, seemingly contradicting the US position on self-determination.",
            "The author claims Algeria is suspected of manipulating the terrorist threat to justify the state of emergency and maintain military control.",
            "The 'Banana Theory of Terrorism' influenced US strategy, positing that terrorists would move from Afghanistan through the Sahara to the Maghreb.",
            "The GSPC (Salafist Group for Teaching and Combat) in Algeria aligned with Al-Qaeda and became Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) in 2007.",

          "source_summary": "This article analyzes the decision-making processes in Spanish foreign policy, focusing on instances where 'Caesarist practices' (unilateral decisions by the Prime Minister) deviate from established consensual approaches. It examines two cases: Spain's involvement in the Iraq War under PM Aznar and the shift in Spain's position on Western Sahara under PM Sánchez. The article argues that both instances demonstrate a departure from established consensus and raises questions about democratic quality and transparency. Regarding Western Sahara, the document discusses the letter from PM Sánchez to King Mohammed VI of Morocco in March 2022, in which Spain considers the Moroccan autonomy initiative of 2007 as the \"most serious, credible and realistic basis\" for resolving the dispute. The article then provides a legal analysis of the letter, noting that it doesn't explicitly deny a self-determination referendum but signals support for Moroccan autonomy, thus departing from Spain's previous neutral stance. It highlights how President Biden did not revert Trump's decision recognizing Morocco's sovereignty over Western Sahara.",

            "The British-American invasion of Iraq in 2003 had the firm support of Spanish Prime Minister José María Aznar.",

            "President Joe Biden has neither revised nor reverted Donald Trump’s decisions recognizing Morocco’s sovereignty over Western Sahara and the city of Jerusalem as the capital of the State of Israel.",
            "On March 14, 2022, PM Pedro Sánchez addressed a letter to Alaouite King Mohammed VI acknowledging the importance of the Sahara issue for Morocco and considering the autonomy initiative presented by Morocco in 2007 as the most serious, credible, and realistic basis for resolving the dispute.",
            "Germany merely pointed out that the Moroccan autonomy plan was a “good basis” for reaching an agreement but not necessarily the best, unlike Spain.",
            "PM Sánchez astutely devoted the main part of his speech at the plenary session of the Spanish lower house on March 30, in the midst of the war in Ukraine to emphasize that his letter should be understood as a position to be assessed “always within the framework of the United Nations and with the agreement of the parties directly involved.”",
            "PM Sánchez expressed himself in similar terms during the general debate of the 77th session of the United Nations General Assembly on September 22, 2022, reaffirming the UN’s central role and sidestepping express support for the Moroccan cause.",
            "In July 2023, after some hesitation, Israel also recognized Morocco’s sovereignty over Western Sahara by letter signed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.",
            "On December 10, 2020, President Trump decided to recognize Morocco’s sovereignty over Western Sahara in exchange for Morocco’s recognition of the State of Israel.",
            "In 1975, Franco's regime opted for Morocco and abandoned the Sahrawi people to their fate. PM Sánchez has finally decided to accept such legacy without the benefit of inventory.",
            "In 2022, PM Sánchez governed in coalition with UP and with parliamentary support of nationalist forces that would never have endorsed this shift on Western Sahara."

Morocco, independent in 1956, and Mauritania, independent in 1960, both claimed sovereignty over the Western Sahara, where Sahrawis desired independence. The text also mentions Morocco's territorial claims on the Tindouf region of Algerian Sahara after Algeria's independence in 1962, leading to the Sand War in 1963. While Morocco later recognized Tindouf as part of Algeria in 1969, it remained firm on its claims over the Western Sahara, despite the UN's 1964 resolution supporting Sahrawi self-determination, accepted by Franco's Spain in 1974 but rejected by Hassan II. The core issue is the opposition of Morocco, Algeria, and the Sahrawis, which prevents Maghreb unity.

It examines how Algeria's commitment to non-intervention has shaped its relationships with neighboring countries like Libya, Mali, and Tunisia, and how it navigates regional conflicts and emerging threats. While the article primarily focuses on Algeria's foreign policy, it also touches upon the dynamics between Algeria, the United States, and Morocco, including the US's increasing interest in Morocco and the potential impact on the Western Sahara issue. It is mentioned that the US Congress's 2015 budget law stipulated that American aid to Morocco should be used for development in the disputed territories, which the Moroccan lobby in Washington interpreted as the consolidation of American policy supporting the Moroccan autonomy plan for Western Sahara, something to which Algeria is firmly opposed.

While it doesn't directly address the U.S. recognition of Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara, it provides context on the complex relationship between Algeria and Morocco, and the influence of other powers in the region.

Also, it refers to the closure of the border between Algeria and Morocco and the influence of France in the region, which indirectly touches upon the political dynamics concerning the Western Sahara issue. In the context of U.S. involvement in the region, the article discusses the potential for an alliance between Algeria and the United States to counter French influence, although it concludes that such an alliance has not materialized due to Algeria's continued reliance on Russian arms and its reluctance to be seen as a U.S. vassal.

While the primary focus is on Morocco's military capabilities, its relationships with other countries (especially the US and France), and its role in regional security, it does indirectly address the Western Sahara issue. The article notes that Morocco aspires to a regional leadership that would allow it to better defend its interests concerning its \"provinces du Sud\" (Southern Provinces), which is a euphemism for the Western Sahara. It also mentions that France's veto power at the UN Security Council allows it to block resolutions hostile to Morocco's position on the Sahara Occidental, hinting at the ongoing dispute over the territory. While it doesn't explicitly mention the US recognition of Moroccan sovereignty over the Western Sahara, it provides context about the regional importance of the issue for Morocco, the diplomatic and military strategies Morocco employs to pursue its interests there, and the support it receives from allies like France and implicitly the US.",

Key points include: the US-Morocco Free Trade Agreement (ALE) signed on June 15, 2004, and its political motivations, as well as the United States' position on the Western Sahara conflict through its support of the Baker II plan. The document notes the inherent link between internal politics and foreign policy regarding the Sahara. It specifically mentions that the question of the Sahara cannot be absent from the objectives of Morocco's relationship with the US, even though the disputed territory is not included in the ALE. The US support for the Baker II plan, proposing autonomy followed by a referendum, is presented as a point of 'désarroi' for Moroccan diplomacy, occurring during ALE negotiations. Morocco's refusal of the Baker II plan in April 2004, coinciding with the resignation of Kofi Annan's envoy to Western Sahara, is also mentioned, reflecting the country's strategic concerns regarding the territory.",

One of the articles, \"Murs de défense au Sahara occidental\" by Khadija Mohsen-Finan, directly addresses the construction of defensive walls in the Western Sahara by Morocco during the conflict with the Front Polisario, starting in 1975. The article examines the military and political motivations behind the construction of these walls during the 1980s, their impact on the conflict with the Polisario, and their role in protecting what Morocco considered the \"useful triangle\" of the Western Sahara, including phosphate mines and major cities. It also discusses the UN's inability to resolve the conflict, the possibility of autonomy for the territory, and the diminishing significance of the walls in the present day (2004).",

The review highlights the court's finding that while the right to self-determination has the status of jus cogens, the respondent states (Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Mali, Malawi, Tanzania, and Tunisia) were not found to be in violation of the Sahrawi people's right to self-determination.

It details historical conflicts, the role of the Front Polisario, and the economic exploitation of the region, including the phosphate industry. The article discusses the transition of the region from Spanish to Moroccan control, including the 1975 Madrid Accords that ceded 65% of the Fosbucraa company shares to Morocco, strengthening Morocco's position as a sovereign nation in the territory. The research focuses on the transformation of indigenous sovereignty in the fossil fuel economy and the continuous power struggle for control over resources and territory involving various actors, such as the Front Polisario, Morocco, and Sahrawi elites. It explains how Morocco's governance strategies involve tribal traditions, fiscal policies, and repression of dissent, while indigenous actors use the UN framework to claim their share of the territory's wealth. The article further explores the transgenerational aspects of this struggle by examining a Sahrawi family's adaptation to these changes from colonial times to the present.",

While the article doesn't directly address the U.S. recognition of Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara, it provides valuable context by discussing Morocco's migration policies, its increasing attractiveness as a destination for Sub-Saharan Africans, and the political and diplomatic efforts undertaken by Morocco, including its re-integration into the African Union in 2017, its potential membership in the CEDEAO, and its efforts to settle the Western Sahara, which is relevant to understanding Morocco's overall position and goals in the region. It also offers information on the demographic situation and economic potential of the Western Sahara and, relatedly, the policies implemented by Morocco to improve its image and institutional stability.

It covers Spain's transition from dictatorship to democracy, its relationship with the United States and Europe, its historical ties to Latin America and the Arab world, and the internal political divisions that influence its foreign policy decisions. While the main subject is Spain's foreign policy orientation, it mentions the gradual distancing of the Spanish government from the Polisario Front and the cause of Western Sahara's independence, thus having an indirect relevance to the question of the United States' recognition of Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara. It details how Spain shifted away from supporting the Polisario Front, a movement advocating for the independence of Western Sahara, which was annexed by Morocco after Spanish troops withdrew.",

The discussion revolves around the political transition in Morocco under Mohamed VI, the role of the monarchy, the army, the political class, and Islamists. While the primary focus is on internal Moroccan politics, the discussion directly addresses the Western Sahara issue as a critical component of Morocco's internal and external political landscape. Specifically, it explores how the unresolved status of the Sahara influences Morocco's relationship with Algeria, its international standing, and even the internal dynamics between the monarchy and the military. It also discusses the potential for the Sahara issue to be exploited for internal political gain by both Morocco and Algeria. While the U.S. recognition of Moroccan sovereignty over the Western Sahara is not specifically named, the discussion of the Sahara's importance in Moroccan politics, the international context, and the relationship with Algeria is highly relevant to understanding the backdrop against which the U.S. decision would later be made.",

The review criticizes the book for presenting an overly positive view of the situation and for failing to adequately address the impact of the ongoing conflict on the region's economy, society, and politics. The reviewer notes that the book mentions the issue of sovereignty and Morocco's presence in the territory being 'a sovereignty awaiting international recognition' since 1975, but it does not delve into the complex repercussions of the conflict involving actors like Morocco, Algeria, Spain, France, the United States, and the Polisario Front. The review highlights the book's focus on administrative organization, demographics, infrastructure development, basic services, and economic strategies in the region under Moroccan administration but notes the absence of critical analysis regarding the disputed status of the territory, the division by a wall, population movements, and the legality of resource extraction. It also mentions the investment by Morocco in the infrastructure with little foreign investment given the continued conflict.",

It mentions Morocco's delayed claim to the area before the UN, partly due to the unresolved status of Western Sahara.

It also references Spain's changing stance towards Morocco's claims and impending negotiations regarding territorial waters, with the Monte Tropic issue in the background. The author expresses concern that Spain might concede too much to Morocco in these negotiations, especially considering the EU court ruling that trade agreements involving Western Saharan waters are invalid without Sahrawi consent. It highlights the potential for a joint exploitation of the Monte Tropic, regardless of the ultimate sovereignty over Western Sahara.

The review highlights the book's approach to the Western Sahara conflict as a key element of Moroccan foreign policy, particularly the pursuit of international recognition of its territorial integrity. The book examines Morocco's management of the conflict, including its shifts between 'offensive' and 'defensive' phases, and the promotion of autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty. The review also mentions Morocco's relations with Algeria, the EU, France, Spain, and the United States, contextualizing the Western Sahara issue within these relationships. Specifically, regarding the US, the review notes that Morocco strives to maintain its role as a 'good ally' while navigating domestic dissent related to the US's actions in the region, linking this to the Sahara issue and competition with Algeria.",

It explores the historical context of this relationship, tracing its origins back to the mid-20th century and the period before Morocco's independence in 1956. The United States' role in facilitating the normalization, particularly the U.S. recognition of Moroccan sovereignty over the Western Sahara in exchange for the establishment of official relations with Israel, is mentioned as a key factor, though the article argues against a purely reductionist interpretation that only focuses on this aspect. The analysis employs neoclassical realism and process tracing to understand the dynamics between Morocco and Israel, highlighting Morocco's position in Israel's peripheral strategy and the various forms of cooperation they have engaged in over the decades. Key events covered include the migration of Moroccan Jews to Israel, intelligence cooperation, economic ties, and Morocco's role in mediating the Arab-Israeli conflict. The article concludes that the December 2020 agreement is a step within a longstanding pragmatic cooperation driven by shared interests and influenced by both systemic and domestic factors.",

          "source_summary": "This article examines the long-standing geopolitical cooperation between Morocco and Israel, arguing that the establishment of official diplomatic relations in December 2020, facilitated by the United States, was a progression of decades of pragmatic cooperation. The article highlights the historical context of Moroccan-Israeli relations, starting before Morocco's independence in 1956, through the reign of King Hassan II, and into the era of King Mohammed VI. It discusses the role of the Moroccan Jewish community as intermediaries, the secret cooperation in intelligence and security, and Morocco's role in facilitating peace negotiations between Israel and Egypt. The article mentions the US recognition of Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara in exchange for normalizing relations with Israel, framing this as a culmination of converging interests. It also acknowledges internal opposition and the sensitivity surrounding the Palestinian issue. The article adopts a neoclassical realism approach, considering both systemic and domestic factors influencing the relationship.",
