It uses the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa as a focal point, examining it within the larger context of Christian expansion and the inability of Andalusi society to effectively resist. The author compares al-Andalus to the Latin principalities in the East, focusing on the role of jihad ideology, the emergence of professional military castes, and colonization strategies. It discusses how the Almoravids and Almohads approached jihad, with specific mention of Caliph Abū Yūsuf Ya‘qūb al-Manṣūr's efforts to promote it and the call to jihad by Caliph an-Nāṣir in 1211 before the battle of Las Navas. The article further explores the development of military structures and colonization policies in both al-Andalus and the Latin East, arguing that the lack of a strong colonizing policy hindered the long-term success of the Almoravids and Almohads despite initial military victories. The piece includes specific information on the Almohad regime and its policies in al-Andalus, as well as analysis of the social system and military organization of Christian territories after conquests.",

          "source_summary": "The article \"Reconquest Colonialism and Andalusī Narrative Practice in the Conde Lucanor\" discusses the Christian conquest of al-Andalus and its portrayal in the work of Don Juan Manuel, specifically in his book *Conde Lucanor* (1340). It addresses how Christian nobles in the 10th century sought to expand their territories southward into al-Andalus, aiming to displace Islamic political power by discrediting Muslim leaders. The article highlights the complex cultural interactions between Christians, Muslims, and Jews in the Iberian Peninsula during the Reconquista, noting the influence of Andalusī culture on the conquering Christians. It argues that the Christian conquest of al-Andalus can be viewed as a colonial endeavor that contributed to the formation of Spanish national identity. The article references the significant Muslim population that remained after the Christian conquests of cities like Cordova and Seville by the 13th century, and suggests that the Reconquista was not a straightforward narrative of cultural purity but a more nuanced and pluralistic reality.",

It identifies key objects like the Table of Solomon, Visigothic crowns, a gemstone (yāqūt) of Ḏū l-Qarnayn, and a jug of pearls (qulayla), associating them with both pre-Islamic and Islamic figures. These objects were also linked to prominent Islamic shrines in the East, such as the pearl Yatīma and gemstone Qulayla, displayed in Jerusalem's Dome of the Rock and Damascus' Great Mosque, respectively. The study analyzes accounts from Andalusian scholars like Ibn Ḥabīb (d. 853) and Aḥmad al-Rāzī (d. 955), arguing that they emphasized the symbolic significance of these spoils as emblems of sovereignty and relics of the past. This served to articulate an Umayyad discourse of legitimacy, connecting past and present, East and West, and highlighting their claim as rightful and pious caliphs. The paper also delves into the transformation of spoils into royal insignia, using the Yatīma and Qulayla as examples, exploring how their possession was contested by rival dynasties. Ultimately, the paper argues that these spoils acted as 'triggers of Muslim collective memory,' enabling the Umayyads to reinforce their identity and claims to the caliphate by establishing a connection between pre-Islamic figures, Islamic shrines, and the Umayyad dynasty, both in the East and West.",

The Almohads are mentioned in the context of their religious outlook nurturing specifically Islamic thought and feeling, but there's no in-depth discussion of their conquest or governance of Al-Andalus.

It details the Muslim conquest in 711, led by Arab and Berber troops, establishing control over most of the peninsula except for the northern mountainous regions where Christian kingdoms persisted. The text describes the subsequent Arabization and Islamization of the region, noting that by the 11th century, most of the population were Arabic-speaking Muslims. The Christian population decreased through emigration, deportation, and conversion, while Jewish communities thrived, except for periods of forced conversion, such as in the early Almohad period (although the Almohads are not the focus of this particular text). The chapter traces the establishment of the Umayyad emirate (756–929) and caliphate (929–1031) in Cordoba, which became a major center of wealth and culture in Europe.  The collapse of the Umayyad caliphate in 1031 due to internal strife led to the emergence of several smaller Taifa kingdoms, which, due to military weakness, were forced to pay tribute to the advancing Christian kingdoms. The fall of Toledo in 1085 prompted the Taifa kings to seek Almoravid aid.  The Almoravids, Berber forces from the Sahara, defeated the Christians at Zallāqa in 1086 and eventually absorbed the Taifa kingdoms into their empire.  The text does not specifically detail the Almohad conquest but provides background context essential to understanding that period and the broader history of al-Andalus.",

          "source_summary": "This 2009 article by Serafín Fanjul analyzes the evolving portrayal of al-Andalus (Muslim Spain) in the Spanish press over the preceding two decades.  It notes a shift from negative to positive representations, influenced by factors such as immigration, oil resources, and broader Western relativism towards the Third World.  However, Fanjul emphasizes that the recent enthusiastic portrayal often relies on a mythical, idealized version of al-Andalus as a uniquely tolerant and pluralistic society. This idealized view, while not entirely new (having precedents in romantic accounts), distorts the historical record and is partly attributed to strategies employed by Arabists and historians to make the topic more palatable to Spanish audiences, who are typically shaped by the ‘Reconquista’ narrative. The author concludes that this manipulation of the al-Andalus myth, regardless of intent, has significant ideological and political implications, calling for a more objective and balanced historical consideration. The article does not directly describe the Almohad conquest itself but instead focuses on the later, modern interpretations and myths surrounding the period of Muslim rule in Iberia.",

It details the initial Arab conquest, which shattered Visigothic control.

The reign of Abd al-Rahman III (912-961 AD), Al-Andalus's first caliph, is highlighted for re-establishing central authority and the Duero border.

The Almoravid and Almohad Berber counter-offensives of the 12th century caused minor border changes.

The author argues that the Reconquista involved three main processes: (1) military control and material expropriation of key sites, including fortresses, walled cities, and mosques; (2) resignification of these spaces through the alteration of religious and cultural references, replacing Islamic symbolism with Christian ones; and (3) the creation of a collective memory justifying the transition from Islamic to Christian rule.  The text details the various methods used to transform mosques into churches, including rituals like sprinkling holy water and replacing the mihrab with an altar, and notes that some Islamic architectural features were sometimes preserved. The paper also discusses the role of military orders in controlling and transforming these spaces, often replacing mosques with churches and using the fortresses as centers for their own religious and military activities.  Further, the author analyzes how Christian narratives of the Reconquista, sometimes embellished with fictional elements, aimed to establish a new symbolic landscape and erase the Islamic past. Examples from various locations across the Iberian Peninsula are presented, detailing the architectural and symbolic shifts that occurred during this period.",

          "source_summary": "This paper analyzes the transmission of Eastern Islamic science to al-Andalus and subsequently to medieval Europe, focusing primarily on astronomy.  It argues that the fall of the Caliphate in the late 10th century significantly disrupted the flow of scientific texts from the Mashriq (East) to al-Andalus.  The paper posits two key factors driving the translation process: the availability of libraries containing relevant texts and the patronage that supported translators.  The study traces the transmission process, starting in 10th-century Catalonia with a focus on astrolabes, then highlighting the interruption in the 11th century due to the lack of libraries and patronage.  The conquest of Toledo (1085) and Zaragoza (1118) revived the process, with the selection of texts for translation often guided by chronological factors. The author examines the works translated by Gerard of Cremona and in Hebrew during the 13th-14th centuries in Languedoc and Provence, finding that most were written before ca. 950, with later translations generally being of local Andalusian works.  The roles of libraries (specifically the Royal Library of Cordoba and King al-Mu’taman’s library in Zaragoza) and patronage are analyzed in detail. The author explores the role of individuals and institutions, such as Bishop Michael of Tarazona and Alfonso X, who acted as key patrons influencing the choice of texts for translation. The paper concludes that the almost total lack of contact with Eastern Islamic science after the 11th century contributed to the decline of Andalusian science after the 12th century.",

Clarke explores the influence of intellectual debates, literary trends, and socio-political contexts on these varying accounts.  The analysis considers how competing priorities shaped the stories and how scholars and patrons in al-Andalus viewed their own history, contrasting it with narratives originating from central Islamic lands like Baghdad.  Key themes explored include the roles of Mawālī and muwalladūn (non-Arab converts and their descendants), geographical representations of Iberia's extremes, the use of historiographical motifs like \"The Table of Solomon,\" and the treatment of traitors and collaborators in both Muslim and Christian sources.  The book aims to provide a framework for understanding these culturally-significant texts, contributing to broader debates about early Islamic historiography.",

The chapter likely examines the factors that motivated participation in the military campaigns leading to the eventual fall of Al-Andalus, including the allure of potential spoils and land acquisition.  The broader book context suggests a comparative study utilizing the experience of Al-Andalus conquest as a parallel to understanding the Spanish conquest of the Americas. Therefore, although not solely dedicated to the Almohad conquest, Chapter 3 and the book's title offer crucial context for the broader historical events surrounding the fall of Al-Andalus and how it may have influenced later Iberian expansion.",

It argues that these narratives, which emerged during the reigns of the Umayyad caliphs Abd al-Rahman III (r. 912–61) and al-Hakam II (r. 961–76), were not accurate reflections of the 8th-century events but rather products of later debates and priorities. The author explores how these narratives reflect both caliphal ideology and the social status of the writers.  The article analyzes various 10th-century sources, including the Akhbar Majmua and the Kitab al-bayan al-mughrib, and discusses the differing accounts and perspectives on the conquest. It also explores the use of literary topoi and the role of patronage in shaping these historical accounts. The focus is on how later interpretations, particularly those from the 10th century onward, served to legitimize the Umayyad caliphate's rule in Al-Andalus.",

The text analyzes Olagüe's claims as a form of historical negationism, contrasting them with the traditional “National Catholic” narrative of the Reconquista.  The author frames Olagüe's work and the subsequent interpretations of his followers as a “historiographical fraud” due to their lack of grounding in reliable evidence and their biased approach. The core argument is that challenging the established understanding of the 711 conquest is used to counter the Reconquista narrative, even if both narratives share more similarities than differences in their ideological leanings.",

Iqbal's 1933 visit to the Mosque of Cordoba, dramatized in his Urdu poem \"Masjid-i Qurtubah,\" is highlighted as a significant moment of Muslim remembrance and reclamation of a lost heritage. Shawqi's 1919 visit to Andalusian monuments, which influenced his poem \"Siniyyah,\" is also discussed. The article analyzes the poetic techniques used to express their feelings about Al-Andalus, particularly the themes of loss, nostalgia, and the inversion of colonial perspectives.

After the Umayyad Caliphate's collapse in the Levant, Abd al-Rahman I established an independent emirate in Al-Andalus, facing internal and external challenges.  His strategic response to the Christian kingdoms in northern Spain, who aimed to regain lost territories, was a central aspect of his rule. The study details his military campaigns, diplomatic efforts, and policies to stabilize the Umayyad state. While he initially succeeded in repelling Christian advances and establishing tributary agreements, internal conflict in Al-Andalus hindered long-term control over disputed areas.

The article explores the transfer of Eastern treatises on falconry to the Christian West via Al-Andalus, highlighting the role of the Al-Moamin treatise.

The article also discusses the practice of falconry among the popular classes and its persistence in the Taifa kingdoms and Nasrid Sultanate.

The author challenges interpretations that portray this society as proto-feudal or simply as composed of free peasants working for others. Instead, the author proposes a model of relatively autonomous peasant communities, with internal hierarchies but significant resilience against external forces,  until the devastating Catalan conquest.

This demonstrates a significant degree of juristic flexibility and adaptation of legal practice to changing legal and political realities, even within the established framework of Maliki school doctrine.

It notes that al-Andalus, the period of Muslim rule in Spain (711-1492), represents a broader history of Christian, Muslim, and Jewish coexistence on the Iberian Peninsula, leaving a lasting impact on Spanish culture. The thesis argues that nineteenth-century Spanish writers used al-Andalus as a historical myth to address their contemporary concerns, including political crises like Napoleon's invasion of 1808, the struggle for a liberal regime, the return of absolutism, and the loss of the American empire.  These events, coupled with Romantic ideals, prompted a reassessment of Spain's national identity.  The thesis analyzes portrayals of Jewish and Muslim characters to show how the use of al-Andalus helped writers process these events and shape nationalist discourses. It finds that the representations of al-Andalus were varied and multifaceted, reflecting the diverse political and aesthetic perspectives of the authors, and were influenced by both earlier Spanish archetypes (like the Spanish Golden Age) and foreign representations shaped by Orientalism. The thesis aims to fill a gap in scholarly work by examining a large body of work, including literature by lesser-known authors.",

          "source_summary": "This doctoral thesis examines 19th-century Spanish literary representations of al-Andalus, focusing on how these portrayals reflected contemporary concerns and shaped Spanish national identity.  The thesis argues that these representations were influenced by both European Orientalism and Spain's unique historical relationship with Islam.  It analyzes various literary works, including plays and short stories, exploring how Muslim and Jewish characters were portrayed, and how the memory of al-Andalus was used to address issues such as the Napoleonic invasion, political liberalism, anxieties about religious freedom and the emergence of regional nationalisms. The thesis discusses the evolution of portrayals, moving from simplistic representations of Muslims as eternal enemies to more nuanced explorations of cultural coexistence and the complexities of identity.  Specific works analyzed include La sombra de Pelayo, Ramiro, conde de Lucena, Boabdil el Chico, Los amantes de Teruel, Los espatriados, Aben Humeya, and La expulsión de los moriscos, among others.

The review discusses the historiographical challenges surrounding the event, particularly focusing on the existence and spread of 'negationist' theses that deny or downplay the historical reality of the conquest. The review highlights Ignacio Olagüe's book (Les Arabes n’ont jamais envahi l’Espagne, 1969) as a primary example of these extreme 'negationist' views.  The article notes that these ideas, often disseminated through the internet, have gained traction outside of academic circles.  García Sanjuan's book is presented as a counterpoint, strongly defending the historicity of the conquest through a rigorous examination of Arabic and Latin written sources and archaeological evidence. The review praises the book's well-argued defense of the traditional historical account, contrasting it with the unfounded claims of Olagüe and the support these claims received from E. Gonzalez Ferrín in his Historia general de al-Andalus (2006).",

The author challenges the prevailing historiographical view that Andalusi society lacked a \"warrior spirit\" and was unreceptive to the ideology of jihad. The dissertation analyzes the articulation of holy war discourse and its relationship to the remembrance of the maghāzī (military expeditions of the Prophet Muhammad) and futūḥ (conquests of the early caliphs). It examines how jihad and memory served as power tools for different rulers in al-Andalus, including the Umayyads, the Taifas, the Almoravids, and the Almohads.  The study utilizes a model of centralized versus decentralized jihad to understand the dynamics of power and legitimacy.  The author analyzes various sources, including chronicles, biographical dictionaries, legal and doctrinal texts, and manuscripts from Moroccan, French, and Spanish archives, to investigate the production, transmission, and transformation of narratives about early Islamic battles in al-Andalus, arguing for a more nuanced understanding of the role of jihad ideology in Andalusi society during this period.  The study concludes that jihad discourses were actively present and influential within Andalusi society, functioning as a tool for legitimacy and mobilization, and that the memory of early Islamic battles played a crucial role in shaping and sustaining this ideology.",

            "The Almohad period saw a near doubling of the production of maghāzī and futūḥ works compared to the Taifa-Almoravid period, with works such as al-Suhaylī’s Kitāb al-rawḍ al-unuf, and works by al-Kalā‘ī and Ibn al-Qaṭṭān gaining importance.",
            "The author points out that Ibn Ḥubaysh’s Kitāb al-ghazawāt and Ibn al-Qaṭṭān’s Kitāb al-rawḍāt were directly commissioned by the Almohad caliphs.",
            "The author notes that the Almohads' emphasis on the memory of early Islam was built upon trends initiated earlier, in the 11th century.",

          "source_summary": "This doctoral dissertation examines the discourses of holy war (jihād) and the memory of early Islamic battles in Al-Andalus from the 10th to 13th centuries.  It challenges the existing historiographical view that Andalusi society lacked a \"warrior spirit\" and was unreceptive to the ideology of jihād. The author argues that jihād was a powerful ideological and political tool used by various ruling powers in Al-Andalus (Umayyads, Taifas, Almoravids, and Almohads), and that Andalusi society actively participated in and adhered to these discourses. The study analyzes how these powers used centralized and decentralized models of jihād, employing rituals, symbols, and the memory of early Islamic conquests (maghāzī and futūḥ) to legitimize their rule and mobilize the population. The author examines the production and transmission of maghāzī and futūḥ texts in Al-Andalus, demonstrating their role in shaping the collective memory and reinforcing the ideology of holy war.  Key figures like Almanzor, Abd al-Rahman III, Yusuf ibn Tashfin, and the Almohad caliphs are discussed within this framework, alongside the use of concepts such as ribāṭ and the importance of the niyya (intention) in warfare. The study concludes that jihād ideology was deeply rooted in Andalusi society and played a significant role in shaping its political and social dynamics, contradicting previous assessments that portrayed Andalusi society as lacking a strong 'warrior spirit'. The author supports their arguments by analyzing a wide range of Arabic and Christian sources, including chronicles, biographical dictionaries, legal and doctrinal texts, and manuscripts from Moroccan, French, and Spanish archives.",

It highlights the scarcity of data for the early period compared to later centuries (6th/12th century onwards).  The article surveys available information on holy places during the Umayyad period, examining their significance to various population segments within the context of Islamicization.  Key aspects discussed include mosques (specifically the Cordoban Friday mosque), graves and associated religious practices, the veneration of trees and relics, and the relationship between Cordoba and Medina.  The author acknowledges that the study is a preliminary exploration, connecting to her broader research on burials, religious practices in al-Andalus, and the Cordoban Umayyads.  The references section extensively cites scholarly works supporting these findings, including discussions of the Almohad use of the Qur'an attributed to Uthman, and also mentioning the impact of pre-Islamic religious beliefs and the persistence of Christian sites and practices alongside emerging Muslim ones. The paper even references potential pagan survivals and the complex interplay between different religious groups and traditions within Umayyad al-Andalus.",

The author argues that understanding the society of that era is crucial to reducing historical biases when analyzing the religious and cultural dynamics.  The abstract highlights three key points:  Firstly, religious conflict between Islam and Christianity was complex, with Islamic influence strong in the south and maintained in the north through taxation, leading to Christian revolts against Islamic authority. Secondly, the Islamic conquest of Iberia and subsequent defense efforts played a significant role. Thirdly, while the abstract doesn't fully detail the third conception, it suggests further societal complexities that impacted the overall situation. The article, therefore, focuses on the Umayyad period in Al-Andalus, a timeframe preceding the Almohad conquest.",

It details the pre-Islamic Iberian Peninsula, including the Visigothic rule and the diverse ethnic and religious groups present. The article then covers the Islamic conquest, starting with Tariq ibn Ziyad's initial invasion in 711 CE, followed by Abd al-Rahman's establishment of an Umayyad dynasty in 756 CE.  The article extensively explores the flourishing of al-Andalus under the Umayyads, highlighting Cordoba's economic prosperity, technological advancements (such as paper manufacturing), and cultural achievements.  It emphasizes the large-scale conversion of Christians to Islam, the relatively tolerant policies toward Jews and Christians ('dhimmi'), and the significant contributions of al-Andalus to philosophy (falsfah) and science. The text delves into the role of Cordoba and Toledo as centers of translation, highlighting key figures such as Maslama al-Majriti, Hasdai ibn Shiprut, and the translators of the Toledo school (including Gerard of Cremona). It discusses the subsequent decline of the Umayyad Caliphate due to invasions by the Almoravids (1090 CE) and the Almohads (1145-1232 CE). The article concludes by examining the intellectual legacy of al-Andalus, noting its impact on the University of Paris and the development of modern science, and how, despite its significant contributions, Al-Andalus's eventual decline was linked to factors such as a lack of universalism and communalism within the scientific community, as posited by Robert Merton. The article also mentions the expulsion of Muslims and Jews from Spain in 1492 under Ferdinand and Isabella, marking the end of an era.",

It challenges the traditional understanding of Mudéjar architecture, arguing that Islamic architectural styles were not simply decorative additions but influenced the functionality and spatial design of buildings in Christian territories.  The author, Juan Carlos Ruiz Souza, emphasizes that Christian architects and builders adopted Islamic styles to varying degrees; in some cases, Islamic architectural styles were fully replicated in buildings like royal and noble palaces.  In other instances, like the facades of 15th-century city buildings or funerary chapels, Islamic elements were incorporated and adapted into a distinctly Gothic style. The article traces this influence back to at least 1859, highlighting Rodrigo Amador de los Ríos's speech, \"El estilo mudéjar en la arquitectura,\" which established the study of Mudéjar as a field, even if the approach was initially one focused on style rather than function.",

While the chapter doesn't directly discuss the Almohad conquest itself, it details the subsequent history of Granada under the Nasrids, who inherited and continued a legacy shaped by the Almohads' previous presence.  The time frame covered (7th–9th/13th–15th centuries) falls squarely within the period after the Almohads' influence, providing valuable context for understanding the state of Al-Andalus post-conquest and the evolution of Granada as a significant kingdom within that landscape.  It outlines the political, social, religious, economic, and cultural aspects of Granada under the Nasrids, showing the enduring impact of its Islamic past, even after the Almohad period.  The chapter positions Granada's Nasrid rule as a direct continuation from earlier periods, highlighting the city's importance as a capital and its continuous evolution.  The fall of Granada to Christian forces in 1492 is mentioned in the following chapter, emphasizing the ending point of the Nasrid rule and the ultimate end of the Islamic era in the region.",

The author argues that this appropriation of Arabic visual culture wasn't simply practical but also ideological.  Christian elites reused these inscriptions, which symbolized power, luxury, and the divine, to solidify their dominion over formerly Muslim territories.  The chapter traces this process from its initial stages to its peak in the 14th century, highlighting the dual symbolism of the reused inscriptions—representing both continuity with the prior Al-Andalus culture and the new Christian power structure.",

          "source_summary": "This doctoral dissertation examines the concepts of Arabization and Islamization in early Islamic history, focusing specifically on al-Andalus (7th-9th centuries).  It challenges the traditional historiography that views al-Andalus as an Islamic Spain from 711, arguing that the processes of Arabization (linguistic and ethno-social) and Islamization were more complex and gradual.  The author argues that Islamization was a consequence of Arabization, a process of cultural creation distinguishing specific practices from others.  The dissertation analyzes the construction of identities in the early Islamic period, examining the use of terms like 'Arab' and 'Muslim.' It challenges the assumption of an established 'Islamic religion' in the early period, preferring the term 'community of believers'. The author uses primary sources, such as the early chronicles (including the chronicles of 741 and 754), Arabic and Latin sources, numismatics, and papyri from sites like Nessana to study the emergence of identities and the interaction between Arabs and non-Arabs (dhimmis). The dissertation emphasizes the relational and reciprocal nature of identity formation, arguing that the use of the term 'religion' to interpret early Islamic history risks anachronism and obscures the fluidity of identities in that context.  It also explores the role of the Mozarabic literature and its contribution to the construction of religious identities in 9th-century Córdoba.  The dissertation concludes by emphasizing the importance of recognizing the discursive, relational, and contextual nature of religious identities in the early Islamic period and highlighting the need for a more nuanced approach to understanding al-Andalus in particular.",

The book examines the role of ceremonial in expressing this concept through gestures, insignia, and hierarchies.  A comparative perspective is offered by examining the Umayyad Caliphate of Damascus, the Abbasid and Fatimid Caliphates, and the Byzantine Empire, situating the Andalusi model within a broader Mediterranean and Eastern framework of the 10th and 11th centuries.

While the primary focus is on textile design, it contains substantial historical information relevant to the Almohad conquest of Andalusia. The paper discusses the establishment of the Umayyad Caliphate in Andalusia by Abd al-Rahman al-Dakhil in 139 AH (756 CE) and Cordoba as its capital, highlighting its cultural significance. It then delves into the characteristics of Andalusian art, including its use of motifs in ceramics, metalwork, and textiles, mentioning the Great Mosque of Cordoba and the Alhambra Palace in Granada as prime examples. The study also touches upon the evolution of Andalusian textile art under the Almohads, noting a shift from animal motifs to geometric and calligraphic designs. The Almohads are mentioned in the context of their initial rejection of luxurious fabrics, only later adopting them, which shows a facet of the social and cultural changes that took place during this period.   The paper then demonstrates a practical application of these historical motifs in contemporary fashion design by creating various garments featuring digitized and embroidered patterns, linking the past and the present. Thus, while the primary argument is about the application of Andalusian patterns in modern clothing, the text implicitly contains historical data that is directly relevant to understanding the broader context of the Almohad conquest and its influence on the artistic development of Andalusia.",

The author, Miguel-Angel Ladero Quesada, argues that understanding the interplay between the aristocracy and the seigneurial system is crucial for comprehending what he terms an \"advanced feudal society\" in southwestern Europe during the late Middle Ages.  The study centers on the 15th century due to a lack of sources from previous centuries and because Andalusian society, developing since the 13th century, had reached maturity by this point, coinciding with an earlier period of economic expansion than in the rest of Europe.  The article examines the aristocracy's characteristics, shaped by the Reconquista and subsequent resettlement of the region in the 13th century and the proximity of the border with the Nasrid kingdom of Granada until the end of the 15th century.  Further topics investigated include large-scale landownership in an underpopulated region, the aristocracy's involvement in large-scale trade, the expansion of aristocratic power through jurisdictional seigneuries, increased seigneurial income, administrative control of royal and municipal positions, a prevalent chivalric mentality and complex lineage-based kinship structures.",

          "source_summary": "This text discusses the concept of the \"Golden Age of Arab Andalusia\" (10th-12th centuries), focusing on the coexistence of Jews, Christians, and Muslims in Al-Andalus.  It examines the historical reality of this symbiosis, questioning whether it was a genuine period of harmony or a myth constructed by 19th- and 20th-century historians, particularly those within the Wissenschaft des Judentums (WdJ) movement. The text highlights the role of Jewish historians in promoting the image of a harmonious coexistence, partially due to the positive perception of Sephardic Judaism in 19th-century Germany and the use of the Sephardic model as a paradigm for Jewish emancipation.  However, the author argues that this positive portrayal often overlooks the realities of the dhimmi status for non-Muslims, which involved discrimination and legal limitations. The Almoravids' and Almohads' reigns are mentioned in the context of their actions against the Mozarabs (Christians of Al-Andalus), including deportations and expulsions, beginning in the 11th century and concluding around the middle of the 12th century. The text further explores the cultural contributions of Jews and Christians, noting the significant influence of Arabic culture on Jewish literature and arts but also highlighting that the “symbiosis” was, in many cases, a one-sided influence rather than a true cultural exchange, and that the experience of Mozarabs was significantly different and far less positive than often depicted.  The text concludes by cautioning against the ideological manipulation of the \"Golden Age\" concept, criticizing its misuse by both neo-Nazis and post-colonial movements.",

Darwish uses Andalusia as a symbol of loss and displacement, comparing the Arab loss of Andalusia to the Palestinian loss of Palestine. The analysis delves into Darwish's poem \"Eleven Stars on the Andalusian Epilogue,\" exploring its themes of mourning, the concept of \"mashhad\" (scene or spectacle) representing the end of an era, and the subtle connection between past and present.  It also examines Darwish's views on the collective Arab memory of Andalusia, noting how he positions Andalusian history within a broader historical context, including the role of the Catholic conquerors.  The text contrasts Darwish's perspective with a tendency towards nostalgic lamentation, highlighting his expression of disappointment, anger, and fear for the future. Further poems like \"Two Guitars\" and \"In Cordoba\" are discussed to show the evolving nature of Darwish's engagement with Andalusia; the latter depicting a complete rupture between the past and present.  The analysis also examines Darwish's poem \"Siege of the Praises of the Sea,\" focusing on his experience leaving Beirut and its thematic parallels with the expulsion from Andalusia.

While not directly about the Almohad conquest of Al-Andalus, it mentions that a branch of the Nefza tribe may have migrated to Spain at the beginning of the Muslim conquest. This suggests a possible, indirect connection to the Almohad conquest, as the Almohads themselves were a Berber dynasty.  The text provides details of the Nefza's presence in various locations across North Africa from Egypt to the Atlantic and the sea of Andalusia, their interactions with other Berber tribes and the Islamic conquest.

The conquest opened the Guadalquivir valley to Castilian occupation, leading to significant changes.  To exploit the new lands, laborers were drawn from the northern grain-producing areas, resulting in decreased cereal cultivation, food shortages, and inflation. The distribution of Andalusian lands to the upper aristocracy increased their power relative to the crown and other societal groups. The small, free peasant landholders common in the north were replaced by large estates (latifundia). For the following century, the king sought support from the upper bourgeoisie to counterbalance the aristocracy's growing influence. Royal privileges granted to the urban patriciate allowed them to monopolize political and financial resources within Castilian cities. By 1350, a new political, social, economic, and cultural structure had emerged that, with variations, has persisted in Castile and Spain.",

It highlights Dozy's use of primary Arabic manuscripts, contrasting his methodology with previous Orientalist scholarship.  The text argues that Dozy's portrayal of Ibn Hazm, drawing from *The Dove's Necklace*,  contributed significantly to Ibn Hazm's lasting fame within Orientalist literature. The analysis explores how Dozy’s work, written up to the Almoravid conquest of Andalusia, shaped the understanding of Al-Andalus and its intellectual figures in the 19th and 20th centuries.  The author intends to examine the cultural, historical, and literary implications of this representation, including the role of nostalgia in shaping the image of Al-Andalus.",

          "source_summary": "This document analyzes the reconquest of Seville and its surrounding areas by Ferdinand III of Castile in the mid-13th century, focusing on the subsequent resettlement and the legal and administrative mechanisms employed.  The text details the military campaigns leading to the fall of Seville in 1248, highlighting key battles and sieges (Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212, Baeza in 1226, Cordoba in 1236, and the siege of Seville itself). It describes the different legal instruments used for the resettlement, namely fueros, repartimientos (land distribution records), and cartas pueblas (settlement charters). The core of the analysis centers on the Seville repartimiento, using two main manuscript versions (Espinosa and Palacio) to understand the distribution of land and properties after the expulsion of a significant Muslim population. The study examines the pre-conquest organization of the Seville region, drawing from Arabic sources (like al-Razi, al-Bakri, and al-Idrisi) to describe the kuras (administrative districts) and their further subdivisions into aqalims. The document contrasts pre-conquest rural settlements (qariya, burj, day'a, majshar) with the post-conquest situation based on the repartimiento.  The author examines the changes in toponymy and the distribution of land to various groups (royal family, military orders, clergy, and soldiers). The study also analyzes the type of agriculture practiced, noting the importance of olive and fig cultivation in the Aljarafe region, and cereals in the Campiña. Finally, it considers the origin and social status of the new settlers, pointing to a significant number of Castilian, Leonese, and Portuguese individuals, along with some Catalans and even a few from France.  The example of Aznalcázar is used as a case study, demonstrating the detailed information available in the repartimiento, including the extent of land redistribution and the types of settlements, showcasing the significant transformation of the rural landscape and property ownership in the aftermath of the Christian conquest.",

The text emphasizes the diverse and multi-layered demographic makeup of these cities, resulting from successive waves of immigration and the relative tolerance of Judaism and Christianity within Muslim society, which prevented widespread exodus (except in cases like Al-Andalus).",

The author notes the conquest of various territories including Syria (636), Egypt (640), North Africa to Morocco (682), and Spain (711-1492), highlighting the subsequent introduction and development of sugarcane cultivation and sugar industry in these regions, as part of the broader dissemination of knowledge and techniques. The text mentions that the industry continued in some areas like Sicily and Cyprus, after the expulsion of the Arabs from Spain, but it eventually declined in many regions following the Mongol and Turkic invasions, except for in North Africa and Morocco, where it continued until the 16th century.",

The analysis focuses on how Boudjedra uses the historical figure of Tariq ibn Ziyad, the Berber leader who conquered Al-Andalus, within the narrative.  The article details how the novel's protagonist, also named Tariq, grapples with his identity and his relationship with his father, who idolizes Tariq ibn Ziyad.  The analysis examines how the novel incorporates and interprets historical texts, including writings by Ibn Khaldun about Tariq's campaign and a 13th-century miniature depicting his advance on Gibraltar. The novel uses these historical sources not as objective accounts but as starting points for a subjective exploration of the protagonist's personal history and identity, marked by themes of respect, disrespect, and the challenging of authority figures.  Specific examples of how the historical figure is portrayed, including the questioning of Tariq's famous speech and contrasting interpretations of his relationship with other figures like Musa ibn Nusair and Count Julian, are presented in the analysis. The analysis also highlights the novel's use of multiple translations and perspectives on historical accounts, which become elements in the protagonist's psychological journey.",

These humanists, reviving Roman toponymy and the ancient tradition of *laus Hispaniae*, wrote during the twilight of the Nasrid Kingdom of Granada and its subsequent integration into Castilian territories. The article demonstrates that the \"Andalusian border\" was central to the humanist's toponymic restoration work.  It explains how these authors attempted to create a coherent narrative, reconciling ancient Baetica with its 15th-century division into Christian Andalusia and the Kingdom of Granada.  The analysis further examines how humanist geographical discourse anticipated and then ratified the Nasrid kingdom's disappearance.  The authors' toponymic choices reflected the complex political situation. The use of \"Baetica\" was often ambiguous, sometimes referring to Roman Baetica, sometimes to Christian Andalusia, and at times encompassing both. The inclusion of the Kingdom of Granada within Baetica in these texts reflects an ideological effort to portray the eventual absorption of Granada by Castile as a natural progression and the restoration of ancient Roman order.",

The itinerary includes visits to historical sites in Seville, Cordoba, and Cadiz, mentioning their history under various empires.  Specifically, it mentions Seville's development under the Almohad dynasty, noting that after the Islamic conquest, it became a powerful city rivaling Cordoba.  The visit to Seville's cathedral notes that it was built on the site of a Great Mosque constructed by the Almohads, with the minaret, Giralda, and the Court of the Oranges remaining from this structure. The brochure also mentions Cordoba's significance as the capital of the Moorish Caliphate of Al-Andalus and the Mosque-Cathedral built there, highlighting its importance during this period. However, the brochure primarily focuses on the description of the cities and does not analyze this period in depth. The brochure offers only a brief mention of the Almohad influence in passing, integrated within a larger travel narrative.",

Gilotte specifically analyzes faunal remains to characterize the late stages of the Albalat border settlement in Andalusia during the 12th century.  Another chapter by M. García García and M. Moreno García explores culinary practices in Cordoba between the 8th and 11th centuries, using historical and archaeozoological perspectives to identify markers of social change. While the book's main focus is on the broader history of food in the Western Mediterranean, these chapters directly relate to Andalusia during the period of Al-Andalus and offer insights potentially relevant to understanding daily life and societal shifts within that context during the period encompassing and following the Almohad conquest.",

While not a primary historical source on the Almohad conquest of Andalusia, it frequently mentions sites and historical periods directly related to the Almohads and their impact on the region.  The itinerary details visits to several locations that were significantly influenced by the Almohad dynasty, including the Alcázar of Seville (which was a powerful city under the Almohads), the Cathedral of Seville (built on the site of an Almohad mosque), and the Medina Azahara (a city built by the Almohad Caliph Abd al-Rahman III). The text provides brief historical context for each site, noting the Almohad presence and influence, including their architectural contributions and the role of the city of Seville during their rule.  The itinerary also highlights the later Christian Reconquista and the subsequent impact on the architectural landscape and the cultural fusion present in Andalusia's historical sites.",

          "source_summary": "This text discusses the ethno-cultural origins of power in Muslim Spain during the Taifa period (11th century).  It questions the simple categorization of Taifa kingdoms into Berber, Slav, and Arab-Andalusian groups. The author notes that the fragmentation of the Umayyad Caliphate into the Taifas followed a period of internal strife (fitna), and considers whether ethno-cultural diversity played a similar role in both the earlier fitna and the later rise of the Taifas. The article argues against a straightforward ethnic interpretation of the Taifa period, highlighting the complexity of ethnic identities and the need to avoid assumptions about the homogeneity of each Taifa or the consistent link between a ruler's ethnicity and the prevailing group within their kingdom.  The analysis suggests that while ethnic factors were present in the earlier fitna, their significance in the formation and dynamics of the Taifas should be treated with caution. The author references Ibn Hayyan's account of the fitna to support the claim that ethnic factors played a role, particularly in the use of community-identifying banners.  The work concludes that a more nuanced investigation is required to fully understand power dynamics during the Taifas.",
          "extracted_key_facts": [
            "The ethno-cultural diversity of al-Andalus contributed to the first fitna at the end of the 3rd/9th century, marked by the integration of Arabo-Berber groups into indigenous society and the acculturation of Hispanic populations.",
            "A century and a half later, a crisis led to the fragmentation of the Umayyad Caliphate of Spain into approximately twenty independent principalities known as Taifas.",
            "The article questions the applicability of the thesis of an Andalusian society divided along ethnic lines during the 5th/11th century.",
            "The ethnic dimension of the struggles for control of the Caliphate in Cordoba during the early 5th/11th century fitna is undeniable, although this is only part of the phenomenon, particularly concerning the use of community banners which both served as immediate justification and fueled its observable dynamics, according to Ibn Hayyan.",
            "The author challenges the classification of Taifas into three antagonistic groups: Berber (or African), Slav (or Slavic), and Arabo-Andalusian (or national, even \"Spanish\").",
            "This classification assumes each Taifa was ethnically homogeneous, its ruler shared a corresponding ancestry with the group, and original cultural specificities were maintained.",

While not directly focused on the Almohad conquest of Andalusia, it touches upon the Reconquista, mentioning that during the Middle Ages, the Reconquista proceeded from two poles, hindering subsequent territorial reforms. This is because the formation of a powerful Spanish state and a unified national identity were never fully achieved, leaving Spain in a perpetual search for itself. The article further highlights that the liberal state of the 19th century attempted to emulate the French model of territorial division, creating provinces but ultimately failing to consolidate a meaningful territorial structure. This resulted in fragmented territories with an inconsistent national identity across various institutions.  The text also addresses the development of nationalist discourse in Spain at the beginning of the 20th century, which involved a double interpretation of territory—both as a physical support for a nation and as an imagined community,  as discussed in Benedict Anderson's (1996) theory of nationalism.",

The review discusses the thesis's focus on the population and social organization of space in the Montes de Torozos region of Castile during the 10th-14th centuries.  A key argument is the rejection of the idea of radical depopulation after the Arab conquest, instead proposing a prolonged demographic decline followed by a gradual repopulation. The thesis analyzes the origins and demographics of this repopulation, noting that it coincided with a significant reorganization of social space. Beginning in the 12th century, dispersed settlements gave way to a network of royal towns ('villas'),  which became centers of power and economic activity. The review also mentions the thesis's use of archaeological evidence from the deserted village of Fuenteungrillo, integrated with textual sources. Finally, the review highlights the thesis's connection to the work of Juan A. Garcia de Cortázar on the social organization of space in medieval Spain and criticizes the limited consideration of English historiography while extensively utilizing French scholarship.",

The research focused on three main themes: historical geography, specifically studying medieval territories and historical topography in three al-Andalus regions (Valencia-Alicante, Andalusia, and the Carrion de los Condes area of Castile); the structures of medieval settlements and villages, with investigations including excavations of deserted villages such as the Hispano-Muslim village of Marinet in Chodos (Castellón de la Plana); and ethnographic and toponymic studies.  The research utilized various methods, including field archaeology, aerial surveys, and the analysis of written documents and toponymy. The research in al-Andalus contributed to the creation of a significant site database.  The study of the Alpujarras region (Andalusia) employed a similar methodology to investigate settlement patterns. The overall research covers a broad geographical area and time period within medieval Iberia, with a specific focus on al-Andalus, but it does not directly address the Almohad conquest itself.",

One book, Rachel Arié's *Études sur la civilisation de l’Espagne musulmane*, focuses on cultural and material aspects of Muslim Spain, particularly the Nasrid period and the preceding Taifa kingdoms.  The other, Leonard Patrick Harvey's *Islamic Spain, 1260-1500*, emphasizes military and diplomatic events. Arié's work compiles previously published studies covering a wide range of topics, including diplomatic and cultural relations between Granada and North Africa, and aspects of material culture such as diet, clothing, medicine, mentality, and literature.  The review also highlights studies on the Taifa period examining ethnic relations, economic realities, courtly love in the work of Ibn Hazm, and the maqāmāt in their Western version.  Both books, according to the review, offer complementary perspectives on the history of Muslim Spain during the period leading up to the fall of Granada.",

Histoire, Sciences Sociales in June 1947.  The article examines the economic supremacy of the Muslim world from the 8th to the 11th centuries, focusing on its control of gold and the universally recognized value of its currency.  The author argues that the Muslim conquests of the 7th and 8th centuries created a new economic entity—the Muslim world—that transcended the political fragmentation of the caliphate, just as the Hellenistic world survived the disintegration of Alexander's empire. This economic dominance extended across both East and West and was largely attributed to the Muslim world's possession of gold and its widely accepted currency. The article aims to investigate the reasons behind the Muslim control of gold and its role in the economic history of the early Middle Ages.",

It highlights Ibn Tufail's connection to the Almohad dynasty, which ruled over much of the Western Muslim world from Marrakech. The text then provides background on the Muslim conquest of the Iberian Peninsula in 711 AD, stating that Visigothic Spain was weakened by internal conflict and unable to withstand the Berber and Arab warriors led by Tariq ibn Ziyad.  The conquest had broad political, social, religious, and moral ramifications, leading to a new chapter in Spanish and Western history. The text mentions that during the first century of Islamic rule, most of the population retained its Christian faith and that the condition of Jews, previously persecuted by Visigoths, improved significantly under Muslim rule.  The article concludes by mentioning that Al-Andalus showed more tolerance to religious minorities than its Christian neighbors during its flourishing period.  While the text focuses on Ibn Tufail, it provides crucial historical context regarding the initial Muslim conquest of Al-Andalus (711 AD) and the subsequent social and religious dynamics of the region.",

Glick's book, \"Islamic and Christian Spain in the Early Middle Ages.\"  The review, by Richard Lemay, focuses on Glick's methodology and interpretations of the social and cultural interactions between Islamic and Christian societies in medieval Spain.  Lemay critiques Glick's approach, highlighting the use of sociological concepts like \"crystallization\" and \"de-structuration\" to interpret historical events. A key point in the review is Glick's discussion of the process of Islamization in Iberia after the Arab conquest, which Glick characterized as relatively slow, leading to a Muslim majority in Andalusia around the year 1000, three centuries after the initial conquest.  The review also notes Glick's acknowledgment of the ongoing debate surrounding the cultural relations between Christians and Muslims in medieval Spain, represented by the controversy between Castro and Sánchez Albornoz.",
