It focuses on how the Spanish military and civilians transformed through their interactions with Moroccans. This transformation included advocating for colonial restraint and admiring Moroccan men, especially Muslim men, for their virility. The author explores the influence of Makhzan diplomats, Tetouanis, and Moroccan cultural practices on the Spaniards. The study also examines masculinity ideals shaping the Spanish appraisal of Moroccan virility, ultimately leading to a 'Hispano-Moroccan discursive camaraderie'. The author traces this camaraderie in cultural artifacts produced during the Spanish Protectorate in northern Morocco (1912–56), suggesting the occupation of Tetouan laid the 'seeds' for modern Spanish colonialism in Morocco.",

Both Cuba and Morocco were sites of recurrent military conflicts, frequent defeats, and significant casualties among both local populations and the Spanish armed forces. The abstract mentions the impact of these conflicts on Spanish political and cultural developments, the unpopularity of these wars in Spanish society, and the role of anti-war sentiment in mobilizing political opposition. It also highlights the impact of the Moroccan wars on Spanish military culture.",

It highlights how these activists organized a propaganda campaign to discredit the French and Spanish protectorates established in 1912. The article reframes the geographical and political hierarchies of Moroccan history by focusing on the individuals and locations previously considered peripheral, arguing that these actors played a pivotal role in the internationalization of the Moroccan question, specifically during the time leading up to and including the Spanish Civil War and early years of World War 2.",

It examines the concept of the 'Spanish colonial dream' as an economic paradise and the subsequent bitterness and imperial nostalgia that emerged with colonial independences. The study compares Spanish experiences in the Spanish Protectorate of Morocco (1912-1956) and the Spanish Territories of the Gulf of Guinea (1777-1778 to 1968), focusing on civilian colonists' perspectives. The chapter also addresses the gendered aspect of colonial experiences and how they impacted men and women differently. One key aspect is the comparison of colonial memories with the experiences of Moroccans and Equatorial Guineans, revealing surprising instances of nostalgia among some Africans due to disappointments with post-independence political systems. The text discusses the rhetoric of conquest used to promote colonization and the differing degrees of enthusiasm for settling in Morocco versus Equatorial Guinea. The Hispano-Moroccan War (1859-1860) is mentioned as a tangible demonstration of Spain's historical ambitions in Morocco, leading to a willingness to settle in the Spanish Protectorate, particularly after overcoming Riffian resistance. The paper notes that the concept of conquest was more prevalent in Morocco, influencing the collective imaginary of the Spanish people. Furthermore, it addresses the end of the Spanish colonial dream and the rejection of changes as colonization neared its end. The study also examines the role of the military in maintaining the Spanish presence and the impact of infrastructure and services on local populations. Ultimately, the text concludes that the Spanish colonial dream was achievable through the power exercised against Africans, showing emotions and experiences gendered differences. Additionally, memories of the colonial past have softened on both sides, with infrastructure investment playing a key role.",

          "source_summary": "This thesis analyzes the development of an unorthodox idea about Spanish identity at the end of the 19th century: the idea that Sephardic Jews should be considered Spaniards. This movement aimed to \"repatriate\" Sephardic Jews to Spain, hoping they would renew Spanish society. The study argues that this development was linked to a widespread perception of crisis among Spanish élites, particularly after the Disaster of 1898. Ángel Pulido Fernández, a doctor and senator, was a key proponent of this idea. The author uses process tracing methodology and concepts from cultural history, such as 'crisis' and 'cultural trauma' to explore this shift in national identity, examining the intellectual climate of late-19th century Spain and institutions such as La España Moderna and the Institución Libre de Enseñanza. The source mentions the Hispano-Moroccan War (also referred to as the African War), which introduced Spanish troops to Spanish-speaking Jewish families in Tétouan, and its impact on shaping new stereotypes about Jews. This is directly relevant to the relationship that was built between Spain and the Jewish populations in the region, impacted by that war.",

            "In 2015, Spain enacted a law to provide citizenship for descendants of Sephardic Jews, reflecting a belief in their Spanish \"essence.\"",
            "Philosephardic thinkers like Pulido saw Sephardim primarily as Spaniards, not as Jews.",
            "Spanish intellectuals sought to interpret history, especially the Middle Ages, to suit their current needs, using history to legitimize political projects.",
            "The sense of crisis in fin de siècle Spain comprised perceptions of Spain's \"decline\" and efforts to solve Spain's problems.",
            "Ángel Ganivet argued that the Disaster of 1898 proved that Spain needed a spiritual renewal.",
            "Spanish intellectuals often saw themselves as having a task apart, denouncing social ills and forming public opinion.",

            "Spain's narratives of national identity engaged with cultural criticisms, using them as tools to make differing visions of Spain's past and future.",
            "The Spanish victory in the African War of 1859 resulted in the signing of a treaty granting further rights in Moroccan territory, and consequently also resulted in a deeper interlinking of Sephardic Jewish interests with Spanish interests.",
            "When troops entered Tétouan in 1860 they discovered Jewish families speaking Spanish, making the existence of Jews descending from those who lived in the Peninsula and speaking Spanish visible to the Spanish public.",

            "The war created new stereotypes about the other and images of alterity.",

            "Emilio Castelar's defense of a Jewish contribution to Spanish history was greatly influenced by the stories he heard about Moroccan Jews during the Hispano-Moroccan War",

            "At the end of the 19th century, a significant number of liberal Spaniards came to support further Spanish involvement in Morocco and the rest of Africa.",

            "Spain could only become European again through Africa",
            "In his capacity as director of Spain’s Department of Public Health, Pulido lamented the lack of education, norms, and infrastructure dedicated to sanitation in Spain, claiming that, in Spain, the “population is stagnant, the stature of individuals diminishes[,] and the vigor of the race decreases” with every passing day.",
            "The increasing ease of transportation and communication across geographical and political boundaries meant that Jewish topics in places as far-flung as Damascus was reported upon in the Spanish press."

The thesis examines the interactions and perceptions of Spanish actors in the enclaves of Melilla and Ceuta, highlighting the complexities of life in these regions during the 19th century. It focuses on the contact, cooperation, conflicts and contradictions that characterized the border region between Europe and Africa, Spain and Morocco, and Christianity and Islam. The thesis discusses how the border situation necessitated conflict resolution strategies and promoted cross-border contacts. The study also considers the varying importance of different categories of difference, such as religion, nation, ethnicity and gender, and the flexible handling of these categories at both institutional and individual levels.

While the main focus is not on the Spanish-Moroccan War of Tetuan, it makes a direct reference to the war and its impact on the perception of Sephardic Jews within Spain. Specifically, it mentions that during the Hispano-Moroccan War (1859-1860), Spanish troops discovered a large community of Spanish-speaking Jews in Tetouan, which brought the existence of Sephardic Jews to the attention of Spanish society. This contact led to a new interest in the Sephardim, contributing to a shift in the treatment and perception of Jewish communities in Spain. The document discusses the political and legal framework surrounding the Jewish people in Spain, including relevant historical figures and laws. While the source is not primarily about the war, it provides a direct link between the war and changes in Spanish society's view of the Sephardim.",

            "The Sephardic Jews in Tetouan were seen as 'liberators' by O'Donnell's men, creating a positive association after the war.",
            "The document also mentions an increasing interest in the Orient by the Spanish and European academic communities in the 19th century, leading to Arabic and Hebrew studies being funded by the European powers to consolidate control over their colonies."

It explores the motivations behind this enthusiasm, arguing that it was linked to the modernization process occurring on the island. The article uses local newspapers (especially El Isleño, linked to progressives) and municipal records to examine the expression of Spanish nationalism, the mobilization of the population, the role of the Church, and the economic interests tied to the war. It also examines the construction of the image of the 'other' (the Moroccans) and the role of the war in solidifying Spanish national identity.",

It examines the system of intervention and control implemented by the Spanish colonial authorities over the Khalifa, focusing on the process of legitimizing the Khalifa, the symbolism used by the Spanish colonizers, and the system of control over the population through the Khalifa figure, complemented by military, educational, and religious policies. The article details the relationship between the Sultan, the Khalifa, and the Spanish authorities, highlighting the tensions arising from the division of Morocco into French and Spanish zones. It also explores the role of figures like Raisuni and Abdelkrim in challenging Spanish authority and the Khalifa's legitimacy. The article analyzes the ritual of recognition of the Khalifa's political and religious authority, including the reading of the Sultan's letter in the Mezquita Mayor of Tetuán and the ceremony of acatamiento in the Mexuar. The historical context includes the aftermath of the Hispano-Moroccan War (1859-1860) and its impact on Moroccan sovereignty.",

The chapter discusses the Spanish occupation of presidios in northern Morocco, including Ceuta, Al Hoceima, Peñon de Velez, and Melilla, and the addition of the Chaffarines Islands in 1848. It highlights the challenges faced by the Spanish in these territories due to Rif tribal harassment and the high cost of maintaining the presidios. Furthermore, the chapter suggests that Spanish national pride and historical claims to Morocco, dating back to the Reconquista, played a role in maintaining their presence despite these difficulties. The text also mentions the increasing influence of France and England in Morocco through diplomatic, commercial, and territorial successes, and how this affected Spanish national pride, ultimately leading to military action advocated by figures like General Leopoldo O’Donnell.

The article mentions a period of \"good occupation\" for two years until May 2, 1862, after which further emigration occurred due to fears of reprisals, primarily to Spain and Oran.

The review, published in Bulletin Hispanique in 1978, discusses the Spanish-Moroccan War of 1859-1860, also known as the War of Tetuan. It highlights the initial enthusiasm in Spain for the war and its subsequent impact, mentioning the socio-economic circumstances surrounding the war and the political motivations of O'Donnell. The review also references Galdós's novel \"Aita Tettauen\" and its depiction of the war, contrasting the initial enthusiasm with later disillusionment following the disaster of 1898. Furthermore, the review draws a parallel between the 1859-1860 war and the events of Melilla in 1893, highlighting the differing outcomes and their impact on Spanish public opinion. Finally, the review notes Joly's work on Tétouan in the Archives marocaines.",

It begins by outlining Spain's territorial claims in North Africa, including Ceuta and Melilla, and the declaration of war on Morocco on October 22, 1859, which led to the Treaty of Peace on April 26, 1860. It then covers the complex interplay between Spanish colonial ambitions, local Moroccan leaders, and European imperial rivalries, leading to the Rif War and its pacification under General Miguel Primo de Rivera. The article explores the shifting alliances and conflicts, including the rebellion of Rogui Bou Hmara, the influence of figures like Abd El-Krim, and the impact of the Spanish protectorate on Moroccan society and culture. Finally it addresses the events leading up to Moroccan independence and the end of Spanish colonialism in the region.",

The document details the construction and purpose of the Moroccan Wall as a defensive structure against Polisario incursions, its impact on the local economy, and the ongoing tensions surrounding the Sahara region. While the main subject is not the Spanish-Moroccan War directly, it mentions the Treaty of Wad-Ras signed in Tetouan after the war, which is a key event related to the conflict.

It discusses the structure and inspiration of the novel, pointing out its division into two main parts: the end of Santiuste's stay in Morocco and the Battle of Uad-Ras, where the Moroccans lay down their arms, and Santiuste's mission in Tortosa and the failed Carlist \"pronunciamiento\" of Ortega.

It analyzes the reasons for the conflict, its impact on the rise of Spanish nationalism, the role of domestic policy and public opinion in directing foreign policy, and the involvement of other European powers like Victorian England and Napoleonic France. It covers the events leading to the war, the initial enthusiasm of the public, the taking of Tetuan, the battle of Wad-Ras, and the Treaty of Tetuan, highlighting the political utility of the war for O'Donnell's government and its contribution to the construction of Spanish national identity.",

The article discusses the Rif region of Morocco as depicted in the writings of travelers, explorers, historians, archaeologists, and geographers from the time of Jean-Léon l'Africain to the present. It mentions that the Rif's reputation as a wild and belligerent area deterred travelers, leading to a modest bibliography on the region. The text refers to the situation framed in 1857 by C. A. Vincendon-Dumoulin and Ch.-Ph. de Kerhallet regarding the difficulty of landing on the Rif coast due to its 'barbarous' nature and the need to repel attacks by pirates. This context is relevant to understanding European perspectives and interactions with Morocco in the period leading up to and including the Spanish-Moroccan War of 1859-1860 (Tétouan War), since it provides information on conditions and attitudes during that era. The text refers to Spanish Protectorate, which, while later, informs the nature of Spanish-Moroccan relations which the war of Tetouan was an element.",

It focuses on the work \"Diálogos españoles-árabes ó guía de la conversación mogharbi\" (Spanish-Arabic Dialogs or Moroccan Conversation Guide), written in 1860 by Pedro María del Castillo y Olivas, which was intended for the military personnel involved in the war. The author argues that despite being aimed at Spanish soldiers in Tetouan following the Spanish-Moroccan War, the Arabic used in the dialogues is actually Algerian Arabic and a plagiarism of Delaporte's \"Guide.\" The article also explores the historical context of Africanism in Spain during the 19th century and how it influenced the study of Moroccan Arabic. The article analyzes the linguistic characteristics of the dialogues, comparing them to other works on Arabic dialects, and investigates the potential sources Del Castillo used, including manuals of Algerian Arabic. It highlights the inaccuracies in Del Castillo's transcription and identifies various Algerian Arabic features within the dialogues. Furthermore, the article delves into the broader context of Arabic studies in Spain during the period, highlighting figures like Estébanez Calderón and Simonet, and analyzing their perspectives on \"vulgar Arabic.\" Finally, the article demonstrates the plagiarism by providing comparative excerpts from Del Castillo's \"Diálogos\" and Delaporte's \"Guide.\"",

The article discusses the impact of the Spanish occupation on the Jewish community, including the respect shown for their institutions, the emergence of a mixed municipal corporation, and the initial steps towards modernization and reform within the Jewish community led by Rabbi Isaac Bengualid. It also presents varying Spanish perspectives on Jewish religious practices and customs, and details about synagogues in Tetuan during that time, especially the synagogue of Salomón Nahon. The source examines the broader context of religious tolerance (or lack thereof) within Isabella's Spain, and the complex relationship between tradition and modernity within the Jewish community during the war and its aftermath.",

It argues that the Battle of Tetuan, or the War of Africa as it is known in Spanish historiography, served as a turning point in Spanish-Moroccan relations, becoming a symbol of national unity and a means to divert attention from internal problems. The article examines the internal and external factors that led to the war, its military course, the ideological and economic motivations behind it, and its consequences for both Spain and Morocco. It also delves into the Moroccan perspective of the conflict, highlighting the resentment and condemnation of the Spanish actions. The author argues that the war, while presented as a patriotic endeavor, was ultimately driven by Spain's desire to regain international prestige and participate in the colonial division of Africa, even if in a subordinate role. The analysis extends to the treaties that followed the war, the financial burdens imposed on Morocco, and the long-term implications for Spanish-Moroccan relations, leading to the establishment of the Spanish-French Protectorate in 1912. The article emphasizes the need to analyze Spanish objectives and limitations regarding Morocco, as they shaped subsequent events up to the second half of the 20th century, and the subordation of Spanish policy to Franco-British interests.",

Although the book was intended for Spanish soldiers occupying Tetouan after the Spanish-Moroccan War (الحرب الإسبانية-المغربية حرب تطوان), the article argues that the Arabic used in the dialogues is actually Algerian, not Moroccan, and that the work is largely a plagiarism of Delaporte's 'Guide de la conversation français-arabe'. The article examines the historical context of the book's publication, linking it to the imperialist sentiments in Spain during the reign of General O'Donnell and the Union Liberal party after the loss of many of their colonies, as well as broader interest in North Africa especially Algeria after the French occupation. The author discusses Del Castillo's background, his position in the 'Sociedad Económica Matritense,' and his dedication of the book 'al ejército de mar y tierra' (to the army of land and sea), suggesting its direct relevance to the military involved in the war. The article analyzes specific linguistic features of the dialogues, including transcription conventions and vocabulary, to demonstrate its Algerian character and the extent of plagiarism. The article also touches upon the justification of the war due to alleged attacks by Moroccan pirates on the Spanish coasts, although it clarifies that this justification might conflate different events and was common at the time. In conclusion, despite its intended purpose, the book reflects more about Spanish perceptions of North Africa generally and is based on Algerian Arabic rather than Moroccan Arabic, though still directly linked to the Spanish occupation of Tetouan after the war.",

It focuses on the work of Fernando Valderrama in Tetouan, specifically his research on Arabic inscriptions and monuments. The article highlights the initial Spanish interest in the area following the 1859-1860 war, the establishment of the Spanish Protectorate in 1912, and the subsequent, though often limited, efforts in archaeological investigation, primarily focused on classical archaeology, but with some attention to Arabic monuments and inscriptions. It outlines various Spanish researchers, travelers, and their contributions to the knowledge of the region's historical and artistic heritage, including the study of Tamuda, Lixus, and the mazmorras (dungeons) of Tetouan. It concludes by noting a shift towards the study of Arabic archaeology after Moroccan independence, particularly in Ceuta.",

The article highlights how 'El Clamor Público' employed propaganda techniques to foster patriotic sentiment, demonize Moroccans, and legitimize Spain's intervention in Morocco. It also delves into the diplomatic negotiations between Spain and England, revealing how Spain sought and eventually secured England's approval for the war by providing guarantees that Spanish actions wouldn't threaten British interests in the Strait of Gibraltar. The article further details how Morocco's acceptance of Spanish demands ultimately did not prevent the declaration of war, indicating Spain's pre-determined intention to engage in military action for colonial gains.",

It mentions the Spanish invasion of Morocco in 1859, referred to as the 'Guerra de África,' and its connection to artistic and revolutionary movements. The review also highlights the book's exploration of the Spanish protectorate in Morocco (established in 1912) and the subsequent Rif War (1921-1926). The text further elaborates on how the concept of 'convivencia' (coexistence) in al-Andalus was used during the colonial period and how Moroccan intellectuals later reinterpreted colonial discourses to forge a national identity rooted in the Andalusian legacy. The review concludes by mentioning the independence of Morocco in 1956 after Spanish defeats.",

While it doesn't directly detail the Spanish-Moroccan War of 1859-1860 (also known as the Tetuan War), it does mention his later activities in the Tetuan region. It covers his artistic contributions during his time in Morocco, including creating maps and panoramic views used by the military. It also highlights his journalistic work, particularly related to the Rif War, and mentions his connection to Tetuan, where he worked as a teacher of drawing. It describes his participation in military actions, including recognizance missions and combats near Tetuan. Therefore, while it focuses on a later period, it offers context about Spanish military campaigns and activities in the Tetuan region, including artistic and journalistic aspects of the military presence in the area, making it indirectly related and useful background information for understanding the broader context of Spanish-Moroccan relations.",

The article outlines Fortuny's experiences during the war, his creation of numerous sketches, watercolors, and preparatory oil paintings capturing scenes of battle, Moroccan life, and portraits. It discusses his major paintings related to the war, namely \"The Battle of Tetuan\" and \"The Battle of Wad Ras\", his artistic process, influences, and the historical context surrounding his works.

The essay is divided into two thematic sections: historical antecedents of the War in Africa and the donations made to defray the expenses of the Hispano-Moroccan War. It explores the political climate in Spain during the second half of the 19th century, including the reign of Isabel II, the Bienio Progresista, and Spanish policies in Puerto Rico.

It discusses the diplomatic relations between Spain and Morocco. The document includes information on specific battles and treaties, such as the Battle of Castillejos and the Treaty of Wad Ras. The paper also details contributions from Puerto Rico including donations from government officials like Federico Montorfano y Laprra, the mayor of Trujillo Alto, military institutions, and residents of various towns.

It details the causes, major events, and consequences of the 1859-1860 war, including the declaration of war by Spain, the organization of the Spanish army, key battles such as Castillejos and Tetuán, and the Treaty of Tetuán that concluded the war. The article then describes the period following the war of 1859-1860, characterized by the rise of an \"africanist\" movement in Spain, and discusses Spain's later involvement in Morocco, including the War of Margallo (1893), the Melilla Campaign/Rif War (1909-1910), the Kert Campaign (1911-1912), and the period of the Protectorate, culminating in the Alhucemas landing and the pacification of the region in 1927.

It argues that the war was not simply a response to an attack by the Kabila of Anyera on a Spanish border post near Ceuta in August 1859, but was rooted in Spain's colonial ambitions and its desire to control the Strait of Gibraltar, particularly after France occupied Algeria in 1830. The article explores how *El Clamor Público* employed propaganda to encourage patriotic sentiment, portraying Moroccans as uncivilized savages and legitimizing Spanish intervention. It also highlights the diplomatic negotiations between Spain and England leading up to the war, revealing how Spain sought and ultimately obtained England's approval for the conflict by providing guarantees regarding navigation in the Strait of Gibraltar. Despite Morocco accepting Spanish conditions, Spain declared war, demonstrating that the decision for war had already been made. The document emphasizes that the analysis of *El Clamor Público* demonstrates how the newspaper and others of its type employed religious, literary, political, historical, and journalistic propaganda to justify the war. The article uses official correspondence between Spain and England to show Spain's maneuvers to secure England's approval before declaring war.",

A major point is that cholera caused a significant number of casualties in the Spanish expeditionary force, exceeding those from combat.

The second chapter specifically examines the 19th century, highlighting European interests in Morocco, including the impact of the Spanish-Moroccan War (1859-1860) on the Jewish community. The review notes how European powers sought the support of the Jewish community and the transformations in the Jewish community's relationship with Muslim society at a time of tension.

It examines how the novel represents the different participants in the war, characterizes the war itself, and how the narrative perspective of a Moroccan regular influences these representations. The thesis also investigates the historical amnesia surrounding the Morrocan involvement in the Spanish Civil War and how Spanish literature perpetuates the demonization of Moroccans. Although the text doesn't directly talk about the Spanish-Moroccan war of 1859-1860, it presents it as a key context for Spanish-Moroccan relations and sets it up to explain later events and views that developed during the Spanish Civil War.",

It examines how Moroccan historians have approached the history of relations between the two countries, considering both the nationalist discourse within official historiography and the revisionist efforts to decolonize and re-evaluate historical events. The study identifies four phases in the historical evolution of Spanish-Moroccan relations: from the Roman Empire to the fall of Granada (1492), the period of colonial expansion and the establishment of the Protectorate (1492-1956), the era of independence and decolonization (1956-1976), and the period of North-South cooperation within the Mediterranean and European context (1976-present). The article highlights the contributions of key Moroccan historians like Abdallah Laroui, Abdelmajid Benjelloun, Édouard Moha, and Muhammad Ibn Azzuz Hakim, with a particular emphasis on Ibn Azzuz Hakim's work on Spanish-Moroccan relations.

It also examines the revitalization of the territory following the pacification of the region, including sanitation efforts, interventions in the Martil port and river, the beginnings of agricultural colonization, and reforestation efforts in Koudiat Taifour. The document further covers the contemporary urban expansion, tourism development, and new urban functions in the region.

Spain and the making of modern Moroccan culture.\" The review discusses how Spain, particularly during the colonial period and the Franco regime, constructed a narrative of shared Andalusian heritage with Morocco to legitimize its presence in North Africa. The review highlights a chapter titled \"Tetouan is Granada\" which discusses the rhetorical uses of al-Andalus in Spanish literature during the Spanish-Moroccan War (1859-1860), also known as the War of Tetouan. It mentions Pedro Antonio de Alarcón, Joaquín Costa, and the Moroccan poet Mufaddal Afaylal as key figures in this context. The review also covers how the concept of Hispano-Arabic culture was used by the Franco regime to improve its international image and how figures like Mariano Bertuchi and Patrocinio García Barriuso contributed to linking Granada with Moroccan cities like Tetouan.",

It challenges the simplistic view that Cuban independence fighters consistently supported Moroccan resistance against Spanish colonialism. The paper argues that racial biases, the influence of European culture, and civilizational perspectives shaped Cuban attitudes towards North African conflicts. It examines the Cuban reactions to the Spanish-Moroccan War of 1859-1860, the mobilization of support for the Spanish army in Cuba, and the participation of Cubans in the Spanish Legion during the Rif War in the 1920s. The paper also explores the views of key Cuban figures like José Martí and their understanding of the Arab world, while highlighting the experiences of Cuban deportees in Spanish presidios in North Africa. It acknowledges that historical evidence paints a complex picture, challenging the assumption of unwavering solidarity between Cuban independentists and Moroccan anti-colonial movements.",

Política y religión bajo el Protectorado español en Marruecos [1912-1956].\" While the review focuses on the Spanish Protectorate in Morocco (1912-1956), it opens by referencing Pérez Galdós' novel *Aita Tettauen*, which is set in Tetuan and concerns 'African wars'. It notes that this novel uses the concept of fraternity between Spaniards and Moroccans. This initial mention, though brief, directly relates to the historical and cultural context of Spanish-Moroccan relations and the specific city (Tetuán) central to the 'Spanish-Moroccan War - War of Tetuan'. While the core of the reviewed book concerns the later Protectorate period, the initial reference to Tetuán and 'African wars' warrants a classification of 'relevant'. The review proceeds to discuss the themes of Spanish-Moroccan relations, the ideology of the Spanish Protectorate, the role of the Spanish administration, and the impact of Spanish colonization on Moroccan society and religion during the Protectorate period.",

It highlights the promotion of tourism in Tetuan, describing it as a beautiful Moorish city, and mentions the conservation efforts of its monuments in 1919. The article also delves into the Spanish colonial administration's efforts to present Marruecos as a modernized and civilized country. The iconographic production of the colonial authorities sought to promote a positive and respectful image of the colonized, though infused with paternalism. Despite the efforts to portray modernity, a traditional image of Morocco persisted in Spanish propaganda, with the focus remaining on handicrafts and everyday life.",

While not directly about the Spanish-Moroccan War of Tetuan (1859-1860), it highlights the importance of Spanish-Moroccan relations as an 'anteroom' to discussing the presence of the Spanish state in the region starting around 1858, immediately preceding that war. The article surveys documentary sources in Madrid archives relevant to Afro-Canarian relations, touching on fishing rights, trade, and colonial ambitions, all within the broader context of Spanish-Moroccan interactions. It explores the period before, during, and after the war, connecting the post-war treaty to earlier fishing and trade activities. The article references the Treaty of Peace and Friendship between Spain and Morocco of 1860, directly resulting from the Tetuan war. It covers historical context, relevant archives, and key figures involved in Spanish-Moroccan relations, making it relevant to understanding the dynamics leading up to and following the war.",

The article covers the period of peace and commerce between Spain and Morocco following the 1767 treaty, the underlying tensions that led to renewed conflict, the siege of Melilla, and the diplomatic exchanges between the two countries. It further details the arguments made by both sides regarding the legitimacy of the war, and concludes with the renewal of friendship and commerce in 1780. While it does not directly focus on the حرب تطوان (Spanish-Moroccan War, Tetuan War), it does describe a similar conflict period between Spain and Morocco in the 18th century that followed failed negotiations and trade agreement disputes.",

It includes articles on Papiamento (spoken in the Dutch and English Antilles), Chabacano (Philippines), Chamorro (Guam), and Judeo-Spanish languages like Ladino and Jaquetía, found in the Mediterranean and Maghreb regions. The text suggests that these languages survive due to a sense of community, fostering trust and promoting business initiatives among their speakers, even within societies that operate in different languages.

While the document doesn't directly focus on الحرب الإسبانية-المغربية حرب تطوان, it covers related themes such as Spanish military campaigns in Morocco (1909-1927) which occurred later in the colonial period, and representations of Moroccans and Moroccan settings in Spanish propaganda and films. Moreover, it examines 'Prim' de Jose Buchs (1930), that contains a sequence of the 1859-1860 war. The paper explores how these films perpetuated stereotypes, promoted a colonial agenda, and addressed issues of identity for both Spaniards and Moroccans. It discusses documentaries, fiction films, and the evolution of the image of Moroccans in Spanish media, moving from 'uncivilized but naive' to 'traitor', and finally to a 'friendly Moor' needing civilization, and how the Africanistas and Arabists portrayed the local people. The study also explores the use of orientalist tropes in films and their influence on the Spanish public's perception of Morocco.",

The abstract discusses the evolution of the stereotype of the 'Moor' from the Middle Ages to the present, highlighting key historical moments such as the establishment of al-Ándalus, the Christian political centralization, the expulsion of Jews and Moriscos, the orientation towards Africa during the 19th century, the colonial period, and the effects of post-colonial migrations. While the main focus is on the stereotype's evolution and its relationship to political interests and the role of Islam, the reference to 'orientation towards Africa during the 19th century' and the broader discussion of colonial contexts suggest a relevance to the historical and cultural background of the Spanish-Moroccan War (Guerra de Tetuán), as the conflict falls within this period of increased Spanish interest and involvement in North Africa, contributing to the development and perpetuation of stereotypes about Moroccans ('Moors').",

It explains how this victory, along with other events like the annexation of Santo Domingo, created an environment of patriotic fervor in Spain. This context led to increased recognition and celebration of Cervantes as a national literary figure. The article focuses on the influence of this historical backdrop on dramatic works of the 19th century centered on Cervantes's captivity in Algiers, analyzing plays like 'El cautivo en Argel' by Joaquín Tomeo y Benedicto, 'Cervantes cautivo' by Jaime Horta, and 'El manco de Lepanto' by Ángel Mondéjar y Mendoza.

While the Spanish Protectorate of Morocco was established in 1912, the war itself was considered a crucial moment in Spain's national consciousness, fostering patriotism despite a disappointing outcome. The war sparked significant interest in the cultural field, with artists attempting to depict both the war and Moroccan society, contributing to the Hispanic understanding of the conflict. The abstract specifically mentions Pedro Antonio de Alarcón and Mariano Fortuny as important Spanish artists who portrayed the war. The article also lists \"La batalla de Tetuán\" as a keyword.",
