It argues that the British perspective often focuses solely on the roles of Sir John Moore and the Duke of Wellington, neglecting the significant contributions of the Spanish and Portuguese. The extract emphasizes that the Spanish resistance and the Portuguese soldiers were crucial to Wellington's success. It also notes that French forces were close to subduing Spain until the Russian campaign diverted Napoleon's attention and resources. The author suggests that without the Spanish resistance, Wellington's victories in 1812 and 1813 would have been impossible. The text highlights the interdependence of the British, Spanish, and Portuguese efforts against the French in the Iberian Peninsula.",

While Spain remained officially neutral, the article explores the internal divisions and external pressures that shaped its stance. German agents were active, offering territorial gains in exchange for support, while pro-Ally sentiments were present among intellectuals and the press. The article also details how Spain's commerce was impacted by the war, including the sinking of Spanish ships by German submarines. The author also mentions the opportunity to recover Gibraltar by diplomacy or force. Despite maintaining neutrality, the article highlights the difficulties Spain faced in balancing its interests and navigating the complex geopolitical landscape of the war.",

Tilson argues that the conditions which initially led President Roosevelt to impose the embargo in May 1937 no longer exist. He highlights the failure of the non-intervention agreement, the acknowledged involvement of Germany and Italy in the Spanish conflict, the dangers faced by American shipping despite the embargo, and the threat that a Fascist victory in Spain poses to the Americas. Tilson contends that the embargo, initially intended as a neutral act, now unfairly aids the insurgents supported by Germany and Italy, and endangers the peace of the United States. He urges President Roosevelt to revoke the embargo to support the Spanish Republic and uphold international morality, arguing that doing so aligns with the principles of peace and democracy.",

            "In the spring of 1937, a Non-Intervention Agreement, including a Four Power Naval Patrol (British, French, German, and Italian fleets), was in place to prohibit arms shipments to both sides of the Spanish conflict.",
            "It was initially hoped that the embargo would lead to a complete arms embargo by all foreign powers, allowing Spaniards to settle the war themselves, which experts believed would result in a government victory.",
            "In the early months of the conflict, Germany and Italy denied involvement in Spain, claiming no troops or official support for the insurgents.",
            "The author argues this was untrue, and Germany and Italy were heavily involved in both the conduct and the origin of the rebellion.",
            "One premise for the embargo was to protect American shipping; however, Spanish insurgents and their allies were openly attacking neutral ships.",
            "Another premise was that the Spanish war was a purely European affair, posing no threat to the Americas, but this was later disproven.",
            "Tilson outlines four premises of the President's Proclamation: the agreement of twenty-seven great powers to stop munitions shipments into Spain; the denial by Germany and Italy of any measure of participation in the Spanish struggle; the distinction drawn by international law and common practice, between shipments of munitions and shipments of commodities not primarily of military importance; and the apparent isolation of the Spanish conftict from events in this hemisphere.",
            "By November 1938, all four premises had proven to be false.",
            "The naval patrol was abandoned shortly after its inauguration, and Portugal demanded the removal of observers from the Portuguese-Spanish border.",
            "Italian and German arms shipments to Franco steadily increased, with even the Italian and German governments ceasing to hide them.",
            "Mussolini was openly bargaining with Chamberlain over the withdrawal of Italian troops from Spain, acknowledging Italian involvement.",
            "Tilson quotes Admiral Cook, stating that reports from Spain indicated that Italian and German bombers, as well as Russian bombers, were operating in Spain, with pursuit escorts.",
            "German and Italian air forces, associated with Franco, were attacking unprotected neutral ships traveling to and from Spain.",
            "Mexico had been openly shipping munitions to Spain for two and a half years without being threatened by Franco, Hitler, or Mussolini.",
            "There were growing concerns about German and Italian ambitions of world empire and Fascist penetration in Latin America."

The author, Jordi Vidal-Robert, argues that the Crown utilized the Inquisition to suppress dissent and prevent internal revolts, particularly when military resources were deployed abroad. The paper posits an inverse-U relationship between war intensity and inquisitorial activity: as war intensity increases, the Inquisition initially increases repression, but decreases it if the likelihood of internal revolt becomes too high. This prediction is tested using time-series data for seven Spanish inquisitorial districts, covering annual trials and wars conducted by the Spanish Crown between 1478 and 1808. The analysis finds an inverse-U relationship, robust to controls for weather severity and spillover effects. Further, the paper examines the motivations behind inquisitorial activity (wealth extraction, religious persecution, social control) using a new database of 35,000 trials, finding that religious persecution was more significant in the early stages of the Inquisition, while repressive motives better explain its later behavior. The paper suggests that the Inquisition helped the Spanish Crown overcome political fragmentation, enabling it to engage in costly wars.",

The collapse of the Spanish monarchy triggered challenges to the colonial regime across Spain's American provinces. This led to demands for autonomy and independence, resulting in political turbulence and violent confrontations. The book traces the development and consequences of these wars, maps the main arenas of war, examines the major campaigns and battles between rebels and royalists, and places the military conflicts in the context of international political change. It explains how war and military mobilization affected Spanish American societies and shaped the emerging independent states.",

The author, Vernon A. O'Rourke, discusses the challenges in international law when a state of war is not formally recognized by third powers, specifically addressing the lack of belligerent rights accorded to either the loyalist or rebel factions in Spain. The article highlights the problems arising from the non-recognition of belligerency during the Spanish Civil War. It addresses questions such as the rights of ships on the high seas and in Spanish territorial waters, the legitimacy of blockades established by the opposing factions (fascist and socialist), and the validity of prize courts. Further it considers the accountability for illegal acts committed by the rebels and the claims the Spanish Government may have against third powers depending on the outcome of the conflict. The potential impact of maritime powers recognizing a state of belligerency in Spain is also discussed, questioning the justification for withholding such recognition given the war's magnitude and duration. The article examines international law precedents and viewpoints, considering topics like Germany's recognition of the rebel government and its impact on belligerent rights.",

Grenville, published in the Journal of American Studies in April 1968. The article discusses the historical debate surrounding the Spanish-American War of 1898 and challenges conventional interpretations of the war's causes and consequences. It argues that President McKinley and his administration were not simply swept along by public opinion but were actively involved in shaping policy. The article also emphasizes the strategic aspects of American foreign policy and the influence of naval officers on national policy leading up to the war. It references war plans from December 1896 and June 1897 and notes that these plans are printed as an appendix to the article, sourcing them from the Office of Naval Intelligence files in the National Archives. It notes the role of Theodore Roosevelt, the then Assistant Secretary of the Navy, and Senator Henry Cabot Lodge. It mentions a note by Hilary Herbert from March 2, 1897, attached to the war plan of December 17, 1896. The article also mentions a letter from Barker to the Navy Department on September 15, 1897.",

The article also discusses the dissension between Hitler and Franco over Spain's neutrality during the Sudeten Crisis and its reluctance to publicize its accession to the Anti-Comintern Pact. The analysis extends to the Treaty of Hendaye and Operation Felix and Spain's eventual contribution of the \"Blue Division\" to the Eastern Front.

The author describes the difficulties and responsibilities these novelists faced. The war began in July 1936 when right-wing army officers attempted to overthrow the left-wing Popular Front government. Writers were used for propaganda by both sides: the Republican/Loyalist government and the Nationalist rebels. The Nationalists declared victory on April 1, 1939. The subsequent dictatorship of Francisco Franco (1939–75) brought censorship and repression, affecting literary production and distribution. Restrictions on Civil War historiography led novelists to attempt faithful representations of the past. After Franco's death in 1975, the transition to democracy included a political amnesty, which left novelists and cinema to represent and explain the war to the public, aiming for reconciliation. Despite these challenges, hundreds of novelists have written about the 1936-1939 period.",

It examines how they portrayed their participation in political and armed opposition to Spanish Fascism and how they constructed the image of the leftist heroic soldier. The article also explores the legacy of the Great War on leftist attitudes towards war and pacifism, the construction of British national identity within the context of the Spanish conflict, and the influence of figures like Lawrence of Arabia. It further investigates the eulogies and memorialization of fallen writers and intellectuals, such as Ralph Fox, Christopher Caudwell, John Cornford, and Felicia Browne, highlighting the fusion of intellect and martial bravery in their representation. The article concludes by discussing the shift in leftist debate from pacifism to active resistance against Fascism, and how the Spanish Civil War contributed to a renewed sense of national identity and prepared the British left for the Second World War.

It starts with the Spanish-American War of 1898 and the subsequent loss of the remnants of Spain's empire. It discusses Spain's neutrality during World War I, foreign policy under Primo de Rivera's dictatorship, the Spanish Civil War, relations with Nazi Germany and Franco's Spain, Spain and the Cold War, and relations with the United States. The book argues that Spain's history is an integral part of European and international processes. The Spanish Civil War was conditioned by the international context, particularly the arms embargo imposed on the Republic by the Western Allies and the support given to the Nationalists by Germany and Italy. Under Franco, Spain remained officially neutral during World War II but sought to join the Axis powers. Spain's diplomatic isolation ended with the Madrid Pact in 1953, which gave the United States military bases in Spain in exchange for financial aid. Spain later joined NATO and the European Union. The book also examines Spain's foreign policy since the end of the Franco dictatorship, its integration into international systems, and its role in world affairs, including relations with Arab and Spanish American countries. It highlights the decline in popular illusions about the benefits of the EU and the conservative Popular Party government's more aggressive foreign policy stance.",

The text examines the roles of key figures like Azaña, Prieto, Caballero, and Gil Robles, and analyzes the policies and programs of different political entities, such as the Popular Front. The document focuses on the socio-economic conditions of the Spanish population, including the peasantry and the industrial proletariat, and analyzes the role of the Church, the army, and the colonial question (Morocco). It also contrasts the events in Spain with other revolutionary experiences, particularly the French and Russian Revolutions. Furthermore, the text discusses the concept of 'dual power' arising from armed proletarians and analyzes events until July 17, 1936.",

It highlights the overwhelming initial support for Franco among the Irish population, driven by religious sentiments and fear of communism.

Simultaneously, a smaller group of Irishmen, led by Frank Ryan, joined the International Brigades to defend the Spanish Republic. The article explores the motivations of both groups, the political tensions in Ireland surrounding the conflict, and the eventual disillusionment and reassessment of the Irish involvement in the Spanish Civil War.

The review points out the Spanish Army's focus on internal repression, the early presence of a fascist movement funded by Mussolini, the Popular Front's 1936 election victory followed by an army revolt, and the revolutionary actions of the people in Barcelona, Madrid, and other cities. It details the anti-clerical violence and land/factory seizures. The review also mentions the Soviet Union's suppression of the Spanish Revolution to appease Western democracies and the role of British foreign policy in Franco's victory due to the non-intervention policy, which ignored Italian and German involvement.

Furthermore, it explores the historiographical debate surrounding the motivations for Nazi Germany's involvement in the Spanish Civil War, suggesting that Nazi goals evolved over time and that the initial small-scale assistance to Franco on July 25-26, 1936, does not fully explain Germany's long-term engagement. It also mentions that historian Wolfgang Schieder characterized Germany’s engagement as a cumulative one, which Hitler failed to control.",

The study used paleomicrobiological techniques, specifically PCR testing of dental pulp from human remains found in a mass grave, to identify the presence of *Rickettsia prowazekii*, the bacteria responsible for epidemic typhus. The analysis of the remains of 21 individuals exhumed from Douai uncovered that 6 individuals were infected with typhus. The *R. prowazekii* strain identified was genotype B, which has been previously found in a Spanish isolate from the 20th century. The authors hypothesize that the epidemic may have been introduced by Spanish soldiers returning from America, further noting that France and Spain were aligned against other European powers during the War of Spanish Succession, and Douai was a strategic location besieged and occupied by both sides. They suggest that diseases transmitted by lice, such as typhus, were common in the past and that the unsanitary conditions of the siege likely contributed to the outbreak.",

It focuses on how the Allies used oil sanctions to influence Spain's alignment with the Axis powers. The abstract highlights three key periods: a successful total oil embargo in August 1940 that deterred Spain from joining the Axis, a period of reduced supplies (1941-42) called 'the Squeeze' that had limited success, and a second total embargo in early 1944 that failed and caused disagreement between Churchill and Roosevelt. The authors used new monthly estimates of Spain's imports of petroleum to analyze these events.",

It explores the use of new military technologies and widespread violence against civilians during the war. The book also discusses the role of often-overlooked elements such as obsolete weapons, vernacular architecture, peasant traditions, and improvised arms. It looks to clarify battles and understand patterns of political violence. The narrative begins with the coup against the Second Spanish Republic on July 18, 1936, and concludes in the early 1950s with the closure of forced labor camps and suppression of anti-Franco guerrillas.

It argues that the British public's fascination with Spain during this period led to a surge in novels, poems, and travel narratives depicting Spanish culture and history. The article highlights that British literature used the Spanish theme inseparably from nationalism, viewing the Peninsular conflict as a crusade to aid a nation usurped by France. These narratives combined exotic elements with military themes, shaping a national ideology that connected loyalty to ideas about political representation and the public sphere. The literature on the Peninsular War also explored themes of war, nationalism, and exoticism, influencing poetry, drama, and narrative fiction.",

The initial majoritarian system, intended to curb the power of local political bosses, instead amplified political divisions between left-republicans and rightist monarchists. The author argues that the electoral system's over-representation effect led to increasing political conflict and violence. The chapter contrasts this with the successful democratic transition after 1977, which was based on proportional representation.",

          "source_summary": "This paper analyzes the Roman war effort in Spain during the Second Punic War (218/217-197 BCE), focusing on the constitutional aspects of Roman command and the war economy policies applied. It argues that geographical conditions and the extent of the Spanish theatre significantly impacted Rome's presence in Spain. The paper clarifies the constitutional framework from 217 to 197 BCE, focusing on extraordinary proconsulships, the authority of the Senate, and the settlement of 198/197. It scrutinizes the war economy policies applied by Roman commanders, concerning the management of the war effort and its consequences for armies and civil populations. The study suggests that the commands in Spain were established by the Senate decree and by law, where proconsuls had supreme power. The Senate governed most decision-making, but tensions arose between the Senate and charismatic leaders who enjoyed popular support. The settlement of 198/197 regularized the supreme command and marked a turning point, showing the Senate never favored imperia constituted extra ordinem. Furthermore, Rome's administrative management involved the active participation of Spanish peoples, the ruthless war economy policies, ad hoc exactions and the lack of a permanent taxation system. The Iberian Peninsula held secondary importance to Rome's geopolitical interest after Sardinia-Corsica, and Sicily. Roman military activity strained the native population, native towns were subjected to war indemnities, and local communities were exploited to provide resources for the troops. The redirection of Carthaginian resources had been a priority, while the Iberian Peninsula became the hinterland of the African front from 206. The Roman commanders also applied several methods that would become permanent features of Roman occupation, such as garrisons in native towns, and treaties with unconditional surrender, which led to issues of Roman abuse of local populations.",

          "source_summary": "This article analyzes questions of international law raised by the Spanish Civil War (referred to as the 'armed struggle now going on in Spain'). It discusses the conflict's character as both a 'rebellion' and a 'civil war' that began as an 'insurrection' led by General Franco on July 17, 1936. A central argument is whether aid provided to the insurgents by Germany, Italy, and Portugal constitutes unlawful intervention. The article examines the juridical status of the Spanish government and obligations of non-intervention. It references the Institute of International Law's projet on foreign powers' duties during insurrections, focusing on the prohibition of supplying arms and financial aid to insurgents. It distinguishes between the rights and duties of states concerning recognized legitimate governments versus rebel forces, asserting that aiding a recognized government against an insurrection is permissible under international law, whereas aiding the rebels is not. The article mentions Russia and France possibly aiding the Spanish government. The United States' policy of non-interference is cited as an example, along with Secretary Seward's statement during an insurrection in New Granada in 1862. It addresses the question of belligerent recognition, stating it imposes neutrality and removes any right to assist either side. The article analyzes the legality of the insurgent blockade of Barcelona and the Spanish government's blockade of ports held by insurgents, referring to the Declaration of London's rules on blockades. The U.S. position regarding the requirement for effective blockades is also discussed, referencing past incidents like the Don Carlos insurrection. The article concludes by examining whether the Spanish government's blockade implied recognition of the insurgents' belligerency.",

          "source_summary": "This historical study examines the diplomatic efforts to end the war between Spain and Chile (1865-1867). It begins by outlining the reasons for the war, including Spain's exploitation of the United States' preoccupation with the American Civil War to send warships to Latin America, aiming to reclaim former colonies. This led to the occupation of the Chincha Islands belonging to Peru in 1864 and subsequent intrusion upon Chile. Spain's demand for coal from Chilean authorities and the threat of military action led to Chile declaring war on Spain in September 1865. The study details the formation of a military alliance between Chile, Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador to expel the Spanish from the region. It covers the diplomatic efforts of Britain and the United States to mediate and end the war, culminating in an armistice between Spain and Chile in April 1871. The study further explores the causes of the war, focusing on Spain's scientific expedition that aroused Peruvian suspicions, the incident at Talambo farm, and Spain's policy of non-recognition of Peruvian independence. The paper details the Spanish occupation of the Chincha Islands in April 1864 and the subsequent demands made by Spain, which included financial compensation for the deaths at Talambo farm. It discusses Chile's opposition to Spain's actions and its preparation to support Peru, the Lima conference, and the increasing animosity towards Spain in Chile. Furthermore, the study covers the Chilean government's refusal to sell coal to Spanish ships and its support for the Peruvian resistance. It elaborates on the appointment of José Manuel Pareja as commander of the Spanish squadron and his negotiations with Peru, as well as the opposition to the resulting agreement. The actions Spain took to settle things in America, and Chile in particular are discussed in reference to the end of the American Civil War. The article also covers the Spanish ships sailing to Chile and Pareja's ultimatum to Chile, which resulted in Chile declaring war on Spain. Naval operations and their effects are described, including the Spanish naval blockade of Chilean ports, the Chilean navy's victories, and Chile's circumvention of the blockade. A major focus is the bombardment of Valparaiso, covering its protection as a commercial center, concerns about European interests, foreign appeals for intervention, and Chile's reaction, which included issuing letters of marque. The study also examines the appointment of Casto Méndez Núñez and the British efforts to move goods from Valparaiso. The article describes the Anglo-French and American attempts to mediate between Spain and Chile, and the various proposals and rejections from both sides. It thoroughly details the efforts of the diplomatic corps and the final armistice, and the effect this war had on Chile's decision to rebuild their naval and trading fleet.",

The article discusses the conflict in Spain during the early Augustan period (27 BC - 14 AD), viewing it as a planned and organized campaign that led to the subjugation of tribes and the completion of the Iberian Peninsula's conquest after two centuries. It highlights that Augustus did not achieve a decisive victory in his military campaign in Spain (26-25 BC); rather, Agrippa's achievement in 19 BC was the final victory. The article argues that the depiction of the conflict in contemporary literary and artistic sources definitively framed Augustus' military success. It suggests Augustus' presence in the campaign was driven by political and ideological considerations, justified by the constitutional settlement with the Senate in 27 BC, which affirmed his continuous military superiority and his declared program of pacification. The research examines the political and military changes in the province of Spain during Augustus' era, noting the lack of attention given to the Spanish campaigns, particularly the Cantabrian Wars, in both literary sources and art. The article also mentions that the Cantabrian War was not celebrated in art, but the pacification was a result of victory, thus celebrating the peace in Spain is a celebration of military victory, which played a role in shaping the image of Augustus' regime.

          "source_summary": "This academic paper, titled \"Personification of the historical victories of Emperor Augustus in the art in province of Hispania,\" directly addresses the Roman military campaigns in Hispania (Spain) during the reign of Emperor Augustus (27 BC - 14 AD). It examines the Cantabrian Wars (26-19 BC) and their representation in both literary sources and Roman art. The paper analyzes how Roman art, including sculptures, coinage, and monuments, was used to portray the Roman victory and the subjugation of the Iberian Peninsula. It discusses specific artistic depictions, such as those on the Prima Porta statue of Augustus, the Ara Pacis (Altar of Peace), and the Gemma Augustea, to illustrate how Spain was personified and integrated into the Roman Empire. The paper also considers the symbolism and meaning behind these artistic representations, including the depiction of Spain as a conquered province and later as a loyal partner in the empire.",

            "The Augustan age (27 BC-14 AD) saw a unique conflict in Roman Spain, a planned and organized campaign.",
            "This campaign resulted in the subjugation of tribes and the completion of the conquest of the Iberian Peninsula two centuries later.",
            "Augustus did not achieve a decisive victory in his military campaign in Hispania (26–25 BC); Agrippa achieved the final victory in 19 BC.",
            "Augustus's presence in the campaign seems motivated by political and ideological considerations, justified by the constitutional settlement with the Senate in 27 BC.",
            "The Spanish campaigns, especially the Cantabrian War, did not receive sufficient attention in literary sources or art.",
            "The celebration of peace in Spain is a celebration of military victory and contributed to the image of the Augustan regime.",
            "Phoenician and Greek traders established settlements in Spain from the 6th century BC due to its natural resources.",
            "During the Punic Wars, Carthage invaded Spain in 238 BC to compensate for lost colonies.",
            "After Rome's victory in the Second Punic War, Carthage ceded its Spanish possessions to Rome, which divided Spain into two Roman provinces: Hispania Citerior and Hispania Ulterior.",
            "Some Spanish tribes, particularly the Lusitanians and Celtiberians, resisted Roman occupation until the end of the Republican era.",
            "At the start of the Imperial era, Spain was divided into three provinces: Tarraconensis, Lusitania (imperial provinces in the north, prone to revolts), and Baetica (a peaceful senatorial province in the south).",
            "Augustus launched several military campaigns in Spain to complete the subjugation of the Iberian Peninsula and consolidate his imperial authority.",
            "Augustus departed for Spain after the settlement of 27 BC because Spain had not yet been fully subdued.",
            "The Cantabri, Astures, and Gallaeci tribes in northwestern Iberia revolted against Roman rule due to political unrest in Rome before Augustus.",
            "Augustus led a military campaign in 26 BC, consisting of Legio I Augusta, Legio II Augusta, Legio IIII Macedonica, Legio V Alaudae, Legio VI Victrix, Legio VIIII Hispana, Legio X Gemina, Legio XX Valeria Victrix, and Legio II Thracum, supported by auxiliary units and cavalry.",
            "Gaius Antistius Vetus and Publius Carisius later joined Augustus's campaign.",
            "Augustus established his military base at Segisama (Sasamon, west of Burgos).",
            "The Cantabri and Astures posed a threat to recently acquired Roman territories, not only defending their freedom but also attempting to control neighboring tribes.",
            "The Cantabri and Astures practiced guerrilla warfare and used the Cantabrian mountains as strongholds.",
            "They used tactics like ambushes and skirmishes and were armed with daggers, short swords, falcatas, arrows, and spears. They defended themselves with wooden shields covered in leather and bronze helmets.",
            "The Cantabrian cavalry was known for close-quarters combat, especially the 'circulus Cantabricum,' where horsemen formed a circle and hurled spears.",
            "Augustus waged war on the Cantabri and Astures separately, starting by besieging the Cantabrian tribes with three Roman armies led by Augustus, Antistius, and Carisius.",
            "The first battle occurred at Attica or Velica, where the Roman army achieved a quick victory, leading the Cantabri to retreat to Mount Vindius.",
            "Augustus's campaign was hampered because the rebels controlled the high ground and ambushed Roman troops.",
            "Mount Vindius fell only when the rebels inside began to starve and surrendered.",
            "Augustus ordered troops to sail to Aquitania and besieged the rebels, who initially held out in Racilium but eventually surrendered.",
            "The Legio VIII may have earned the honorific title 'Hispana' or 'Hispaniensis' during this campaign.",
            "Augustus fell ill during the campaign and moved to Tarraco, leaving the subjugation of Spain to his commanders.",
            "Gaius Antistius achieved success because the barbarians underestimated him.",
            "Titus Carisius captured Lancia, the main fortress of the Astures, after they abandoned it, and seized several other places.",
            "Carisius established three winter camps near the Astura River, and the Astures launched a coordinated attack, but Carisius was reinforced and defeated them.",
            "The fortified city of Lancia opened its doors to the defeated army, and Carisius prevented his soldiers from burning the city.",
            "The last battle of the Cantabrian War was the siege of Mount Medullius, where the Roman army blockaded the rebels, cutting off supplies and forcing them to surrender.",
            "Following the war, several Roman military settlements were established, most notably Emerita Augusta, settled by veterans of Legio V Alaudae, Legio X Gemina, and Legio XX Valeria Victrix.",
            "In 19 BC, Agrippa received news of a rebellion in Iberia involving enslaved people who had killed their masters.",
            "Agrippa went to Hispania Citerior to assess the situation with Publius Silius Nerva and found an army demoralized by endless fighting and on the verge of mutiny.",
            "Agrippa led a campaign against the rebels but faced resistance from his own troops, who were old, war-weary, and afraid of the Cantabri.",
            "Agrippa restored discipline and morale and marched towards the enemy in the mountains.",
            "Literary sources lack details of the war of 19 BC, stating it was one of Agrippa's most difficult, as the Cantabri were experienced fighters and desperate to avoid re-enslavement.",
            "Agrippa suffered losses and demoted many soldiers, being disappointed with the performance of Legio I Augusta, stripping it of the honorific title given by Augustus.",
            "Agrippa destroyed all enemies of conscription age, disarmed the rest, and forced them to descend from their fortresses and live on the plains.",
            "Strabo confirmed that by his time, the wars had ended after Augustus Caesar subdued the Cantabri and neighboring peoples.",
            "Agrippa's victory in 19 BC ended the war in the Iberian Peninsula, which had lasted two centuries. The Astures, Cantabri, and Gallaeci were integrated into the Roman army.",
            "Rome imposed security on the region by strategically distributing legionary camps and road networks and establishing urban centers and an effective administrative system for exploiting Spanish lands.",
            "The Senate voted to grant Agrippa a triumph after his Cantabrian victory, but he declined it.",
            "Roman art portrayed the victory in Spain realistically, celebrating Augustus's achievements in the Cantabrian and Asturian wars.",
            "Iberian weapons and stacked shields adorned funerary sculptures of veterans and settlers.",
            "A tombstone depicts a shield with a maze design, ship parts, a helmet, and sacrificial tools, symbolizing that Augustus's efforts in the Cantabrian War led to victory in the West, complementing the victory at Actium in 31 BC.",
            "On a Doric frieze, the same maze shield is depicted with the pugio and falcata, symbolizing victory over the Cantabri.",
            "Roman sculptures in Rome represented the defeat of Spain and its incorporation into the Roman provinces.",
            "The cuirass of the Prima Porta statue of Augustus surrounds the scene of the return of Roman standards from Parthia with two neighboring seated figures on the left and right.",
            "One figure on the left wears a cloak and is unarmed, while another figure on the right wears a short tunic and cloak, rests her head on her hand, and holds a sword, with a Tropaeum behind her. These are Spain and Gaul.",
            "Horace mentioned that Agrippa's power subdued the Cantabri, just as Phraates knelt before Caesar's power.",
            "Augustus's imperium was renewed over Spain, Gaul, and Syria, likely celebrated by the cuirass sculptures.",
            "Pauline suggests that the military tropaeum behind Spain could be related to Dalmatia, where a fourth standard was recovered.",
            "Spain on the Prima Porta cuirass wears a chiton and lacks Celtiberian weapons, and the way she holds her sword confirms her identity as defeated Spain (Hispania Capta).",
            "Spain is personified as a barbarian people exhausted by war, a representation consistent with contemporary literary sources.",
            "Two winged sphinxes were sculpted on the shoulder clasps of the cuirass to symbolize Augustus's victory at Actium.",
            "Caelus holds a 'sky' cloak, and below him, the sun god Sol leads his steeds across the sky, with a goddess holding a torch in front of the sun's chariot and another winged goddess holding a jug in her left hand.",
            "Apollo plays the cithara on a winged griffin, and Diana rides a deer to the right. Terra Mater lies in the lower part of the cuirass, holding a cornucopia, with two children eating.",
            "The scene on the center of the cuirass is the return of the Roman standards from Parthia, flanked by personifications of Gaul and Spain, unifying East and West under Augustus.",
            "Spain was not only depicted as a defeated province in Rome, it was also seen at Lugdunum, where a monument was erected in honor of Augustus.",
            "The monument consists of three commemorative panels, two of which feature a tropaeum fixed to a tree trunk covered with a cloak, below which is a kneeling, naked, and bound man, and a standing woman wearing a chiton. These refer to the victory over Spain and Gaul.",
            "Griffiths stated that the Lugdunum Tropaeum commemorates the military success in Spain, Gaul, and Actium based on the presence of the prow of a ship, but it declares Rome's and Augustus's dominance over the world by land and sea.",
            "The Lugdunum tropaeum did not commemorate a specific military campaign but aimed to confirm Roman control and convey a message of Roman presence and cultural dominance to the indigenous population.",
            "The combination of land and sea tropaea gives the group victory and control, and the presence of the monument in a small regional capital symbolizes the ownership of the land on which it was erected, marking Rome's control over the Roman borders.",
            "The tropaeum of the Spanish group is similar to that depicted on Carisius's coins and includes a trophy decorated with the enemy's weapons, surrounded by two figures, a kneeling prisoner and a standing woman.",
            "The representation of the Spanish woman resembles her depiction on the coins.",
            "The Lugdunum woman has a classical style, wearing a chiton that slips from her left shoulder to reveal her breast and has a faint smile on her face, expressing surrender to grief. Spain continues to point to the defeat of the Cantabri.",
            "The monument represents a declaration made by Augustus where he worked to stabilize the situations in Spain, Gaul, Germania, and all lands from Gades to the Elbe, indicating the unity of the West and the stability of the Western provinces under Augustus's leadership.",
            "Spain is identified due to Lugdunum's geographic proximity and the association of the personification with female prisoners.",
            "The monument proclaims that the defeat of Spain has caused her to be insulted, and she is now accompanied by a member of her barbarian people, conveying the message of Hispania Capta (Spain has fallen).",
            "Zanker was wrong in pointing out that the Cantabrian War did not appear in art. Augustan art aimed not to show the war itself but the peace that resulted from the war. Celebrating the peace resulting from the war is in itself a celebration of military victory.",
            "Augustus's Spanish campaigns and the settlement that followed are indirectly visible on the Ara Pacis (Altar of Peace), which celebrates the dynasty, myths, and values of the Republic.",
            "The altar's construction was approved in 13 BC in celebration of Augustus's successful return and the completion of the reorganization of the Western provinces.",
            "The depiction on the left of the entrance on the eastern side of the Altar is the goddess Pax Augusta (Augustan Peace), embracing her twin children, symbolizing Italian fertility in general and Romulus and Remus in particular. Animals symbolize animals sacrificed for Pax and the fertility that resulted from the end of conquest and civil war.",
            "The nymphs on the Pax panel symbolize the peace of sea and land (pax mari terraque).",
            "The whole monument is an declaration of the successes of the new world order called for by Augustus in his record of achievements, where wheat and fruit indicate the return to agricultural fertility and the absence of war.",
            "The 'Lupercal' panel on the western side of the Altar likely included images symbolizing the glorious golden age, such as the god Saturn or Janus.",
            "The panel represents the era of abundance and peace during the entry of the worship of Janus and Saturn into Italy. The panel is a way for the Roman system, as the Altar was built based on a decision of the Senate, to compare the age of Augustus to the glory of the past and emphasize fertility.",
            "The panel on the right of the entrance above the eastern side, used to depict the goddess Roma sitting on a heap of weapons.",
            "Another interpretation is that the panel used to depict the goddess Roma or the goddess of wrath (Furor), since imprisonment of Furor ensures that her madness will not bring war to the happy race of Romans. This depiction is well suited to the topics of the Altar of Peace to illustrate how the system of Augustus succeeded in restricting the bad civil war and sought the good war (Roman settlement).",
            "The panel of above the western side depicts an old man about to sacrifice a pig. Most scholars agree that this is Aeneas, the ancestor of Augustus, who recently arrived in Italy and is making a sacrifice to appease Juno as a gesture of peace.",
            "There are those that claim that this refers to Numa Pompilius (715-672 BC), whose name was associated with peace and who built the temple of Janus that remained open when Rome was at war and closed at times of peace.",
            "Augustus's wars affected the literary depictions of Spain and its peoples.",
            "Strabo presented an unmatched evaluation of Spain under the early Empire, based on a series of contradictions between the civilized, fertile south and the barren, barbarian north.",
            "Other sources focused on the military campaigns and the tactics of war, and Augustus and Rome held the main historical, cultural, and political roles, having saved the Spaniards from barbarism, with direct reference to its founding of settlements, regional reforms, and the Augustan peace it imposed.",
            "The artistic depiction of the province of Spain and its people was influenced like in literary sources, with Spain appearing as a defeated people, or a bound and defeated male prisoner, or the accumulation of weapons to declare its defeat, indicating the spoils of victory. There was a shift from the negative portrayal of Spain during the early years of Augustus's rule to the more positive portrayal emphasized at the end of his era.",
            "During the Cantabrian War and immediately afterward, the images of Spain capta dominated, when defeated Spain and its conquered tribesmen were placed alongside the country of Gaul and with the Parthia and Egypt. The contrasting images, in the works where there was a more civilized, prosperous, Spain, that became more in agreement with the rule of Augustus, Spain earned its justice, it appeared with an olive wreath as a symbol of prosperity. Had she carried the weapons to defend the empire, with the passage of time, her portrayal shifted from being the target of conquest to an ally in conquest. Yet, the Roman Empire and Augustus were dominant in art."

It begins by detailing Portugal's internal situation before the war, characterized by economic, social, and political instability, which led to a shift from monarchy to republic. Despite this change, Portugal continued to face challenges until António de Oliveira Salazar assumed power, establishing a dictatorship but also bringing some political and economic stability. The paper then explores the reasons for Portugal's intervention in the Spanish Civil War. Relations between Spain and Portugal were strained due to differing political and ideological views, particularly the contrast between the Portuguese dictatorial regime and the Spanish republican government. The paper highlights Portugal's support for the Nationalist faction led by General Francisco Franco, starting immediately after the war began on July 17, 1936. Portugal became the first international ally to support the Nationalists, providing crucial diplomatic, logistical, and material aid that significantly contributed to their victory against the Republicans. Throughout the war, Portugal served as a conduit for weapons and a passage for Italian and German forces aiding Franco. The study also discusses the reasons that prompted Portugal to interfere in the Spanish civil war, the support that Salazar gave to the Spanish Nationalist rebels even before the breaking of the war, and the treaty of friendship that both countries signed in 1939.",

The article discusses King James's relationships with various religious denominations and factions in Scotland, England, and other European countries before and after he ascended the throne of England in 1603, up to 1612, when his religious policy shifted towards tolerance. It sheds light on the challenges faced by rulers in managing religious relations to maintain social stability, especially when the monarch is the head of the church. The article examines King James's internal and external religious relations, some of which were based on mutual benefit. The article mentions that James concluded a peace agreement with Spain known as the Treaty of Somsert. Under this treaty, Spain pledged to cease support for the Irish Catholic rebels in exchange for England withdrawing its military support for the princes in the Netherlands and the Low Countries who were fighting against the Spanish presence there. The treaty was supported by most statesmen of both countries. James aimed to end Spanish support for the Irish rebels to suppress their rebellion by force, improve the kingdom's foreign relations with Catholic European countries, and end the state of war with Spain to reduce financial expenses and use these funds to improve the kingdom's economic conditions.",

It explores Britain's political, economic, and military situation after World War I, which led it to prioritize stability in Europe to avoid another major conflict and focus on economic recovery. The paper also discusses the internal instability of Spain before the Civil War. It argues that Britain's non-intervention was driven by a combination of economic interests (protecting British investments in Spain, especially in mining), political considerations (fear of Italian and German influence in the Mediterranean, potential loss of Gibraltar, and preventing the spread of communism), and social factors (avoiding internal division within Britain). The study details Britain's concerns about Italy's ambitions in the Mediterranean, the strategic importance of Gibraltar, and the potential for the Spanish Civil War to escalate into a wider European conflict. It also touches upon the divisions within British society regarding the Spanish conflict, with the Labour Party supporting the Republicans and the Conservatives leaning towards the Nationalists. Ultimately, the paper concludes that Britain's policy of non-intervention was a pragmatic decision based on its own self-interests and the prevailing political climate in Europe.",

Both novelists incorporate real events like the Spanish Civil War (حرب مع إسبانيا), fascism, and the Sabra and Shatila massacres, alongside fictional and autobiographical elements. They shed light on the causes of socio-moral decay. One suggests that Jews are the root of France's weakness in the 1930s, while the other exposes Israeli brutality towards Lebanese and Palestinians. The study utilizes autobiographical, historical, ideological, and ethical criticism to analyze the novels. The paper also discusses the authors' backgrounds, aesthetic elements of the novels, and how they address racism, war, and antisemitism. It explores the characters' roles in expressing the authors' ideas and ideologies, and how narrative techniques serve the thematic purposes. The analysis covers topics such as racism, antisemitism, the violence of war, and the authors' perspectives on these issues, highlighting the political and social contexts of the novels.",

The occupation negatively impacted Tangier's economic, social, and political conditions, abolishing the existing international institutions and integrating the city into the Spanish protectorate. This led to resistance from the city's inhabitants.

It focuses on two main points: the reasons that led to the fall of Granada, attributing it to Queen Isabella's Catholic zeal and the unification of Castile and Aragon through her marriage to Prince Ferdinand. The aim was to expel Muslims and strengthen the Crusader spirit. The second point revolves around the revolts and Islamic resistance following the fall of Granada due to the oppressive policies of King Philip II against the Andalusian Muslims. These policies included restrictions on bearing arms, confiscation of weapons, and imprisonment, which led the Andalusians to revolt to defend their faith, identity, and dignity. The article highlights the importance of studying the history of the Islamic resistance in Andalusia after the fall of Granada.",

This article discusses the Spanish occupation of Tangier during World War II, specifically from June 14, 1940, to October 11, 1945. The article details how Spain, under Franco's dictatorship, exploited the circumstances of World War II to occupy Tangier, fulfilling long-standing imperial ambitions. It explores the negative impact of the Spanish occupation on Tangier's economic, social, and political conditions, the abolition of the previous international system, and the city's integration into the Spanish protectorate. The article also mentions the resistance of Tangier's population to the occupation and their aspirations for restored rights. Finally, it notes the end of the occupation on October 11, 1945, and Tangier's return to the international system, setting the stage for its participation in the Moroccan independence movement.",

The article explores how Al-Khattabi organized the resistance, the reasons for its eventual failure due to the collaboration of major colonial powers and their use of inhumane tactics, and how the Rif War became a focal point for both colonial powers and colonized populations. The study aims to shed light on how Al-Khattabi leveraged various factors to organize a tenacious resistance and also to investigate the reasons for the failure of the Rif resistance, which relied on the conflicting interests of the colonial powers, who quickly allied to end the Rif War. The war drew the attention of both the Western world and colonized populations to the events unfolding in northern Morocco, becoming a platform for colonial powers to settle scores and for colonial subjects to re-evaluate themselves.",

It explores how Goya reflected the history of Spain, political upheavals, and social issues in his art, focusing on his emotional and technical approach. It specifically notes his depictions of war and societal anxieties which directly stem from historical events in Spain. The article analyzes several of Goya's famous works, including \"The Spell,\" \"The Colossus,\" \"The Third of May 1808,\" \"Saturn Devouring His Son,\" \"The Sermon (also known as The Little Witches)\" and \" Pilgrimage to San Isidro\" examining his unique style, use of color, and expression of emotions related to Spanish society's transformations, including the impact of war and conflict.

The abstract describes the revolutionary and liberation movements in Africa during the second half of the 20th century, with the Arab world being particularly affected. It mentions four wars against oppressive colonial powers (1948, 1956, 1967, and 1973), during which nationalistic movements gained freedom for their countries. The study focuses on Egypt and Morocco as examples of Arab countries with distinct roles in the struggle for independence. The period under analysis starts with Morocco's independence in 1956 and concludes with the death of President Anwar Sadat in 1981. The imposition of French protection on Morocco in 1912, Spanish control over northern Morocco, and British dominance in Egypt led to simultaneous resistance movements in both countries, including the 1919 revolution in Egypt and the Rif War in Morocco (1921-1926). These movements fostered liberationist ideas. Many North African fighters sought refuge in Egypt, which supported them. The 1952 revolution in Egypt coincided with Sultan Muhammad V's suffering under French control in Morocco, strengthening the relationship between the two countries. The Free Officers in Egypt openly opposed all forms of colonialism and established the 'Voice of the Arabs' radio station for this purpose. The abstract mentions Spain's control over northern Morocco as a factor influencing resistance movements in the region.",

It also notes the Seljuk threat to Eastern Europe and the subsequent European response, driven by religious zeal and a desire to counter Islamic expansion. The Monastery of Cluny in France encouraged Christians to fight and expel Muslims from Spain, which was eventually achieved in the 15th century (9th Hijri century). The Papacy and Italian cities, concerned by Muslim influence in the Mediterranean, also engaged in military projects against Muslims, including in Al-Andalus (Spain), Greece, Italy and Sicily, referred to as the \"Holy War\" or \"Reconquista\".",

During this period, before the central Rif was under Spanish control, tribal leaders maintained order through customary laws, imposing fines and penalties. Spain, however, was implementing policies to infiltrate the region through agents, destabilizing the society, creating internal conflicts, and encouraging the rejection of customary laws. The document then focuses on the case of the village of Tizi Ayash, which was sentenced to destruction by Rif tribes in 1917 for a moral crime committed by one of its members. The village sought defense through tribal alliances, leading to the cessation of customary law enforcement until the rise of Abd el-Krim. Thus, while the text does not focus on direct military conflict with Spain, it discusses Spanish influence and policies in the Rif region during the period leading up to the Rif War, a conflict with Spain, which is considered a relevant context.",

The document uses a written tribal document and oral accounts to understand the political and historical context. A member of Tizi Ayash committed a crime, leading neighboring tribes to demand collective punishment, including a heavy fine (dthira) and the destruction of the village. The village refused to comply, forming an alliance to resist the judgment. This refusal occurred during a period of political vacuum between the signing of the Spanish Protectorate treaty in 1912 and the start of the Rif War in 1921, when Spanish agents were attempting to undermine tribal structures. The document also explores the economic hardships of the time, including drought and the impact of World War I. The paper suggests this incident contributed to the breakdown of customary law and possibly to the events that later contributed to or were misremembered as the 'Seven Years' War' within the Aith Waryaghar tribal confederation, and which created an environment more prone to future conflict with Spain.",

It highlights the strategies employed by both sides, including instigating conflicts in Morocco, forming alliances with rival powers such as the Byzantine Empire (for the Umayyads), and spreading the Ismaili doctrine (by the Fatimids) in Andalusia. The conflict took various forms, including espionage, a \"spiritual war\" over the Islamic Caliphate, naval armament, and undermining each other's influence. The Umayyads, under Abd al-Rahman, gained control of Moroccan seaports and won over local sheikhs against the Fatimids. The Umayyads also formed alliances with Islamic tribes hostile to the Fatimids and combatted Shiism in Andalusia. Ultimately, the conflict led to military clashes between the two powers. The study concludes that both states were prepared to respond to any attempt to weaken them, sought to expand their influence, and establish strong diplomatic relations to ensure stability.",

It highlights the role of the Spanish enclave of Melilla as a key port for this migration. While the article's main focus is not on war with Spain, it explores the complex relationship between Spain, France, and the Rif region, and how Spanish presence in occupied ports like Melilla influenced the migratory patterns and the attitudes of imperial powers towards this migration. The article also mentions instances of Spanish authorities attacking Rifian boats and the Spanish government's perspective on the potential military advantages of facilitating migration. Therefore, it is relevant due to its discussion of Spain's influence and actions in the Rif region.",

            "The article focuses on the seasonal migration of Rifains (from the Rif region in northern Morocco) to western Algeria during the second half of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, originating from the occupied port of Melilla.",
            "Several factors drove this migration, including the poverty of the Rif region and the availability of work in Algeria, especially during harvest seasons.",
            "Imperial powers, France and Spain, had varying positions on this migration depending on their regional interests.",
            "The opening of the Rif to the Mediterranean Sea facilitated the movement of Rifains to Algeria, and the importance of this movement increased after the arrival of international shipping companies to occupied ports in northern Morocco, seeking profits.",
            "The port of Melilla served as the gateway from the Rif to the outside world, with tribes closest to the port being the most frequent users of the sea route to Algeria.",
            "The Spanish authorities were concerned about the growth of trade between the Rif coast and Algerian ports and took measures to hinder it, including attacking Rifian boats. In one instance, in November 18, 1852, the Spanish seized a boat with goods from Qelaia bound for Oran.",
            "Heightened conflict between the people of Qelaia and the Spanish from 1891 onwards strengthened ties between the eastern Rif and western Algeria, particularly with Oran and Nemours.",
            "In July 1854, the French authorities sent the warship 'Newton' to the Gulf of Tangier with orders to destroy all Rifian boats, but this was opposed by Charles Jagerschmidt, who feared negative consequences for France.",
            "France refrained from intervening economically as punishing the Rifians and destroying their boats would negatively affect the Oran market, which was supplied with goods by Rifian boats.",
            "The Spanish consulate in Oran reported in 1855 that inhabitants from areas near Melilla requested the governor of the fort permit free maritime transit from Tetouan to Algerian ports.",
            "In 1855, the governor of Melilla began granting navigation permits (passports) for a fee, generating revenue and offering Spanish protection and documentation.",
            "The Spanish administration encouraged the Rifians to use the sea route, hoping to reinforce Spain's regional role and normalize relations with the neighboring tribes.",
            "Spanish authorities hoped that facilitating maritime voyages to Algerian ports would reduce the population of the Rif, thus weakening local resistance.",
            "The Spanish government under General O’Donnell ordered the governor of Melilla to grant passage permits in the interest of peace and suppressing piracy, extending Spanish protection to the migrants.",
            "France opposed the migration via Spanish controlled ports because of the Franco-Spanish rivalry to extend influence into the Rif region.",
            "In 1859, France forbade the disembarkation of Moroccans from Melilla in Oran due to a Hispano-Moroccan conflict.",
            "French authorities blocked the return of Rifians to Melilla by sea, prompting the residents of Qelaia to petition the Spanish consulate in Oran for secure sea passage.",
            "France proposed using Nemours as an alternative port with passports issued by the المخزن and visas from the French consulate in Tangier.",
            "By 1930, Spanish overseers in Morocco were carefully documenting the numbers of Rifian migrants in Algeria, attempting to curtail or at least diminish the magnitude of this migration.",
            "From 1855, Rifians departed by sea to Algeria, with the importance of this route increasing in later years.",
            "In 1882, 7706 Moroccan workers, mainly from the Rif, entered Algeria from Oran, a figure that doesn't account for those entering through Nemours and Arzew.",
            "In 1892, about 7000 people departed from Melilla to Algeria.",

It analyzes their reports and correspondence to identify biases in their accounts of violence in both Republican and Nationalist zones. The article highlights how the diplomats' social backgrounds, political leanings, and personal experiences shaped their understanding and reporting of the conflict, particularly regarding the extent and nature of repression in each zone. It suggests that their anti-revolutionary sentiments and affinity for order influenced their sympathetic, or at least muted, reporting on the violence perpetrated by the Nationalist forces, while they were much more critical of Republican violence. The study employs lexical analysis ('word clouds') of French diplomatic communications from 1936-1937 to identify key terms, perpetrators, and characterizations of violence in both Republican and insurgent held territories, revealing stark differences in the portrayal of violence in each zone.",

L’Espagne face aux interventions fascistes durant la guerre civile\" by Ángel Viñas, published in Relations internationales in 2018, examines the crucial role of the Spanish Civil War within the international system of its time. It discusses the internal factors leading to the July 1936 uprising, the reactions of the international community, including the non-intervention policy and the interventions of fascist powers, and the Soviet Union's eventual support of the Republic. The article highlights the isolation of the Spanish Republic and the failure of the international community to effectively address the conflict, ultimately leading to the Republic's defeat. It also touches upon the enduring legacy of the war and its impact on European politics.",

          "source_summary": "This academic article, \"La guerre d’Espagne dans la presse impériale (1808-1814)\" by Jean-René Aymes, analyzes the portrayal of the Peninsular War (Guerra de Independencia Española, also known as the Spanish War of Independence) in the French imperial press between 1808 and 1814. The article examines how the Napoleonic regime controlled and manipulated information regarding the conflict in Spain to shape public opinion in France. It highlights the propaganda techniques used, including the suppression of unfavorable news like the capitulation at Baylen, the exaggeration of French victories, and the negative depiction of Spanish insurgents and British forces. The study also discusses the promotion of Joseph Bonaparte's regime and the presentation of French intervention as a civilizing mission. The author emphasizes the role of the press in constructing a biased narrative of the war, focusing on military aspects while downplaying political and economic factors, and perpetuating stereotypes about Spain and its people. Furthermore, the article points out the importance given to Spanish merino wool by the French and discusses the French perspective on the Spanish guerrilla warfare. Ultimately, it suggests that while memoirs offer a different perspective on the war, they should also be viewed critically.",

The article discusses how Alfred Brauner, a volunteer with the International Brigades, and his wife Françoise, a pediatrician, worked with refugee children in Spain starting in 1937. They collected and analyzed thousands of drawings made by children impacted by the conflict, interpreting them as expressions of their experiences and emotional states. The article details the types of drawings produced, the themes they explored (such as bombings, evacuations, and separation from family), and the Brauners' efforts to use these drawings to help the children cope with their trauma. The article also discusses a contest organized by the Secours Rouge International in Barcelona which invited children to create drawings on the theme, 'Ma vie avant, pendant, apres la guerre.",

It argues that the importance of Jihad should be appreciated from a sociological perspective, and not only from a strict Islamic doctrine perspective. The document highlights the initial Muslim expansion into Spain and its gradual transformation into a war of position. The text also contrasts the evolution of the concept of Jihad among Muslims with the evolution of the concept of Crusade among Christians, suggesting that Jihad started as a movement of conquest and became a means of maintaining positions, while Crusades began with the idea of preventing infidels from hindering Christianity and evolved into a holy war.",

It details how Mexico, under President Lázaro Cárdenas, supported the Spanish Republican government against Francisco Franco's rebellion, providing diplomatic, human, and military aid. Despite this support, Franco's forces, backed by Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, won the Spanish Civil War in 1939, leading to a mass exodus of 500,000 refugees. Mexico evacuated 20,000-30,000 Spanish Republicans, joining earlier refugees. Mexico remained a strong opponent of Franco's Spain, hosting a Republican government in exile in 1945 that aimed to overthrow Franco with UN assistance. Until 1952, Franco's government sought Mexican recognition, which was never granted. Mexico continued to recognize the Spanish Republic. Ultimately, complex post-World War II politics prevented the Republic from overthrowing Franco. Mexico served as a boundary between the two Spains until 1952, when Francoist Spain entered UNESCO.",

It examines the PPF's progressive alignment with Franco, highlighting Jacques Doriot's visit to Spain in the summer of 1938 as a turning point. The article notes the PPF's initial hesitation in taking a clear position on the Spanish Civil War, followed by an increasingly pro-Franco stance as its opposition to the French Front Populaire solidified. The article also emphasizes the transnational networks that supported this alignment. The PPF was created on June 28, 1936, by Jacques Doriot in Saint-Denis.

The article analyzes the socio-historical events that shaped the life trajectories and geographical mobility of the Sahrawi generation born during the Sahrawi-Moroccan war (1976-1990). It covers various experiences of displacement, educational mobility, return to refugee camps, and economic migration, linking these to the relationships forged by the Sahrawi government in exile with different states, including some within the Soviet sphere of influence. A key theme is the support provided by Cuba, especially in education, which enabled thousands of young Sahrawis to study there. The article also discusses the migration of Sahrawis to Spain, the challenges they face, and the implications of this migration for the Sahrawi society and its political project. Specifically, the article details the historical context of the Western Sahara conflict, including the role of Spain as the former colonizer and the subsequent migration of Sahrawis to Spain. It mentions that some military cadres from Polisario received initial training in the Spanish colonial army, and the article discusses the process by which Sahrawis obtained Spanish nationality.",

          "source_summary": "This document is a speech by the Sahrawi Ambassador Hash Ahmed commemorating the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR). It details the history of the Western Sahara, focusing on the end of Spanish colonization, the Madrid Accords, the subsequent invasion and occupation by Morocco and Mauritania, and the ongoing struggle for independence by the Sahrawi people represented by the Polisario Front. Key points include Spain's withdrawal from Western Sahara in 1975 without complete decolonization, its agreement with Morocco and Mauritania to cede the territory, and the ensuing conflict. It also addresses the international context, including the role of the UN, the involvement of other countries (US, France), and the relationship between the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (RASD) and Latin American countries, particularly Venezuela. The speech highlights the ongoing dispute over the territory, the failure of the UN peace plan, and the call for a referendum on self-determination, along with criticisms of Morocco's actions and the exploitation of Sahrawi resources.",

It identifies three distinct periods: the era of Francoist heroization up to 1965, a period of silence during the late Franco regime and the democratic transition, and a resurgence of memorialization from the mid-1990s onwards. The document argues that the focus shifted from glorifying war heroes to commemorating victims. It examines different strategies employed by these monuments, including realistic, symbolic, pathetic, and elliptical approaches, to convey the trauma of the war. The author also explores how the memory of the Spanish Civil War has been intertwined with the memory of the Holocaust, leading to a confusion of victimhood narratives. It critiques the tendency to conflate the Francoist repression with the Holocaust. The document concludes that while the figure of the victim, placed in the historical perspective of the Shoah, offers paths for reconciliation, there is still a lack of space for critical history in the Spanish memorial landscape.",

It explores the ideological underpinnings of Spanish expansionism, rooted in a desire to restore Spain's former imperial grandeur and reject liberal values. The document details Spain's claims to Gibraltar and the international zone of Tangier, as well as broader ambitions in the region including parts of the French protectorate of Morocco and parts of Algeria. It examines Spain's complex relationship with both the Axis powers and the Allied nations, highlighting the country's declared neutrality while simultaneously engaging in negotiations with Germany regarding potential territorial gains in exchange for military support. The text also covers Spain's occupation of Tangier in 1940, the international reactions to this action, and the subsequent negotiations with Britain. Finally, the document concludes with the re-establishment of Tangier's international status after the end of World War II. While not directly a 'war with Spain', this describes the political and territorial tensions and events which could have led to a war with Spain.",

L’Espagne, la Hollande et les projets de révolte de 1674\" from Mélanges de la Casa de Velázquez. The article discusses the failed revolt projects in France in 1674, supported by the Dutch Republic and the Spanish Crown, during the Franco-Dutch War (1672-1678). It revisits these revolts from a Spano-Dutch perspective, using new sources to examine Spain's role in the underground war against Louis XIV. It discusses the involvement of key figures like William III of Orange and the strategic considerations of Spain and Holland, including treaties, funding, and planned military support for internal revolts within France. The article highlights Spain's active participation in organizing, coordinating, and financing this \"underground war\" against Louis XIV in multiple French regions, including Normandy, Guyenne, Languedoc, Provence, and Roussillon. It analyzes the coalition between Spain and the Dutch Republic against France, including the potential benefits and limitations of Spanish support, such as the prioritization of its Italian possessions. The article also discusses a treaty signed between William III and Jean-François de Paule, Seigneur de Sardan, which outlined plans for revolts and mutual support. The text further explores the fear of a Dutch landing on the French coasts and the strategies and motivations of William III and the Spanish regency. Ultimately, the article concludes that the revolts failed due to France's solid defenses and the inability to secure a junction with imperial troops, despite the diplomatic efforts and ambitions of Spain and the Dutch Republic.",

It studies the mortality crisis caused by the war, estimates the human losses, examines their temporal and spatial distribution, and assesses the war's impact on the evolution of the Spanish population. The article addresses a gap in existing research on this war, which primarily focuses on military and political aspects and less on its human cost. It uses parish registers to estimate mortality rates, comparing them with previous demographic crises and mapping the geographical distribution of mortality peaks in 1809 and 1812. The article also notes that the war was preceded by a demographic crisis, making it difficult to determine the precise impact of the war on the population. It estimates that approximately half a million inhabitants disappeared due to the crises in 1809 and 1812. The author contends that the victims were primarily civilians who suffered from famine and epidemics, though precise statistics are uncertain due to limited data from the era.",

The chapter discusses the connection between two groups of revolutionary intellectuals in the autumn of 1935: the surrealist group and the group around Georges Bataille. These intellectuals formed an 'Union de lutte des intellectuels révolutionnaires' called 'Contre-Attaque'. This group, founded with a manifesto by Georges Bataille, aimed to offer an alternative to the communist party's phraseology. Bataille and Breton emphasized phenomena of collective psychology. While Bataille proposed a 'Front populaire' on the street, Breton aimed to create a 'plan d’exaltation générale'. However, due to internal disagreements, 'Contre-Attaque' dissolved in April 1936. The text further mentions the future secret society 'Acéphale', animated by Georges Bataille, which distanced itself from 'Contre-Attaque' through apoliticism and criticism of political ideologies. The episode of 'Contre-Attaque' contributed to a rift between Éluard and Breton.

Internal revolts in both Spain (Portugal, Catalonia, Naples, Sicily) and France (the Fronde) complicated the conflict. The war concluded with the Peace of the Pyrenees in 1659, resulting in territorial gains for France and the marriage of Louis XIV to Marie-Thérèse of Spain.",

The document highlights key figures like Federico Tedeschini (nonce in Madrid until 1936), Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli, Cardinal Pizzardo, Cardinal Francesco Vidal i Barraquer, Cardinal Gomâ, and diplomats Hildebrando Antoniutti and Amleto Cicognani, who were crucial in communication and policy during this period. It also addresses the relations between the Vatican and the Spanish Republic (1931-1936) and the impact of prior events such as the Concordat of 1851 and the anticlérical law of 1910.

The abstract describes the War of the Oranges as a brief but insightful conflict that foreshadowed the later tensions in Spain, specifically the Peninsular War of 1808. The French army's prolonged presence on Spanish territory fueled resentment among the population, who were incited by religious figures and witnessed recurring violence. The War of the Oranges, initiated by Bonaparte, aimed to compel Portugal to close its ports to the English, with Spain under Manuel Godoy's leadership as an ally. The article examines the journey of General Lamarque's brigade from Perpignan to Salamanca, revealing a less than glorious picture of what was initially perceived as a simple military march.

The article explores how the Spanish Civil War is represented in the works of several contemporary Belgian Francophone writers, including Hubert Nyssen, Jacques-Gérard Linze, Pierre Mertens, Vincent Engel, Francis Tessa, and Issa Aït Belize. It discusses how the war impacted their lives and writings, particularly focusing on their personal connections to the war, such as growing up in progressive environments supportive of the Spanish Republic or having family histories intertwined with the events of the 1930s and 40s. It references Hubert Nyssen's recollection of the war marking a \"sinistre ouverture aux réalités du monde\" during his adolescence.

The review, written by Élise Julien and published in the Revue historique in 2021, discusses the book's exploration of the memory and legacy of the Spanish Civil War in the town of Belchite. Belchite was a conservative town in Republican Aragon that fell to Franco's rebels at the start of the war. The Republicans captured it during the Aragon campaign in the summer of 1937. In 1938, rebel forces bombed the village, turning it into \"Franco's Belchite,\" a heroic village and showcase for the regime. The original village was left in ruins, and a new Belchite was built nearby as a monument to Franco. The ruins became a site of conflicting memories of the war. During the Franco regime, the ruins were used to denounce the Republic and glorify the Nationalists. After the transition to democracy, the ruins became a source of embarrassment, and efforts to create a unified, reconciled memory of the war failed. The book examines the different ways in which the Spanish Civil War is remembered and commemorated in Belchite and how the physical space of the ruined village contributes to the formation and perpetuation of these memories.",

The war, fought between absolutists (Carlists supporting Don Carlos) and liberals (supporters of Queen Isabella II), led to a destabilization of traditional cross-border activities, movements, and exchanges. The French authorities, allied with the Spanish government, took measures to control the border and prevent the Carlists from being supplied. This resulted in increased surveillance, restrictions on cross-border commerce, and an increase in illegal activities like contraband, especially involving military supplies and horses. The border populations, however, adapted by finding ways to maintain connections through legal and illegal means, such as refugee assistance and smuggling. The article also discusses the political interpretations of these borderland practices and the tensions between the French and Spanish governments regarding border control and the management of Spanish passports. The article concludes by emphasizing the reconfigurations of the border space due to the war, including the increased state control and the agency of the borderland populations in shaping the border's function.",

It reflects on Bartolomé Bennassar's comprehensive, yet politically neutral, overview of the conflict, highlighting its balanced approach to the massacres and its analysis of France's ambivalent attitude towards Spanish exiles.

The review also addresses François Godicheau's book, which focuses on the role of the CNT and the internal contradictions within the Republican Front, particularly in Catalonia. It discusses the CNT's initial unpreparedness for central power, the entry of anarchist ministers into the government, and the subsequent tensions with the Communist Party, culminating in the May 1937 events in Barcelona. The review emphasizes the challenges faced by the CNT in balancing revolutionary ideals with the need for order and discipline, and the increasing legal and police repression faced by anarchists within the Republic.",

It details the concerns of the consul regarding the political climate in Naples, the disloyalty of some Neapolitans towards Philip V of Spain, and the impending Austrian invasion and eventual occupation of the Kingdom of Naples in 1707. The article focuses on the years 1706-1707, and it includes excerpts from Argoud de Laval's dispatches to the French ambassador in Rome, Cardinal de La Trémoille. These dispatches reveal the consul's pessimism about the ability of the Spanish and Neapolitan authorities to resist the Imperial forces, particularly due to the lack of resources, the incompetence of the local government, and the growing support for the Habsburgs among the Neapolitan population. The article culminates with the Imperial takeover of Naples on July 7, 1707, ending Spanish rule in the kingdom.",

It begins by noting that the conflict, which started on July 18th of the previous year (1936), was intended by the military party to be a short campaign but had instead become a costly and drawn-out struggle. The article argues that the war had evolved from a civil conflict into a foreign war due to external interventions, dividing Europe into two camps. It highlights the influx of advanced weaponry, military specialists, and trained troops into Spain, turning it into a testing ground for various governments. The article intends to analyze the motivations behind these interventions, whether driven by ideals or interests. The text outlines the origins of the conflict, tracing it back to February 1936 when the Spanish parliament was dissolved, leading to a coalition between socialists, anarchists, and bourgeois leftists known as the Frente Popular (Popular Front). The Front Popular secured a majority with 270 seats against 200 for the right and center parties. The author asserts that the extremists within the coalition aimed to establish a dictatorship of the proletariat, leading to acts of terror and vandalism as the government lost control.",

It further examines the 'films of destruction' genre within the war's filmography and the emergence of 'films of the frontier' documenting the 'retirada' and the internment of Spanish Republicans.

Le cas de la guerre d'Espagne\" (Civil War and Social Change: The Case of the Spanish War) by François Godicheau, published in 2003. The article discusses the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) and its complex nature as both a revolution and a counter-revolution. It examines the war as a national and international conflict, the culmination of conflicts in the 1930s, and the beginning of Franco's dictatorship. The article also touches on the debates surrounding the definition and chronological limits of civil wars, particularly in the context of social change. The abstract mentions the comparison of the Spanish Civil War with other civil conflicts like those in Finland and Greece, and also with hypothetical civil wars within Italy and France during World War II. It ultimately questions the conventional understanding of the Spanish Civil War and the historical struggle associated with naming the war.",

It discusses the complexities of defining it as a civil war, comparing it to other conflicts and examining its unique characteristics. The author examines how the war accelerated existing social and political crises in Spain, leading to radicalization and polarization. It covers the revolutionary and counter-revolutionary movements, the redrawing of social boundaries, the establishment of the Franco regime, and the long-lasting impact of the war on Spanish society, including repression, economic hardship, and the reshaping of political identities. The article highlights the initial revolutionary changes in the Republican zone, including collectivization and worker participation, and the subsequent militarization that suppressed these changes. The legacy of the war includes the division between victors and vanquished, deeply rooted hatreds, and the long-term social and political consequences for Spain.",

Les volontaires étrangères dans la guerre civile espagnole (1936-1939)\" by Renée Lugschitz discusses the role and motivations of hundreds of women from around the world who volunteered in Spain between 1936 and 1939 to defend the Republic during the Spanish Civil War. It highlights that these women were often overlooked in historical accounts, being reduced to the roles of wives or humanitarian aides, despite their significant contributions as interpreters, reporters, militiawomen, administrators, nurses, and doctors. The article aims to correct this perception, emphasizing their political commitment and agency in the conflict, often at great personal risk. It examines the reasons why these women chose to fight against Franco and international fascism, focusing on their backgrounds, motivations, and the limited equality they experienced within the milices and the International Brigades. Despite facing gender biases and being excluded from leadership positions, their experiences in Spain provided them with greater autonomy and a sense of camaraderie.",

The article explores the criticisms Negrín faced, including accusations of being a puppet of Moscow, prolonging the war unnecessarily, and mishandling the Bank of Spain's gold reserves. It also examines the internal divisions within the Republican government and the political battles Negrín fought against both the Nationalists and dissenting voices within his own camp. The imposition of censorship and the \"Pact of Forgetting\" are discussed as mechanisms to control the narrative of the war and its consequences. Ultimately, the article analyzes how Negrín became a figure of myth and propaganda in the Francoist narrative and the difficulties in accessing an objective truth about his role in the conflict.",

It aims to clarify the apparent contradiction in Philippe Sagnac's statements regarding the decline of French commerce during the War of the League of Augsburg and the resilience of private individuals and companies in maintaining trade. The article questions the accuracy of claims that the merchant marine was failing, trade routes were unprotected, and Bordeaux was unable to sell goods. The text highlights the lack of quantitative data on the European economy during this period, which makes it difficult to understand the interaction between wars and economies. It touches upon the international payment mechanisms during wartime when the United Provinces were belligerent and Spain was a battlefield. It also mentions the Franco-English armistice proclaimed on August 21, 1712, and the continuation of Franco-Dutch hostilities until the spring of 1713. The article explores how war impacted trade, particularly focusing on maritime pressure from enemy powers.

The study examines how these newspapers, reflecting divergent political views, debated the necessity and risks of French military intervention in Spain. It explores the censorship imposed on the press, the frequency and sources of information used by the newspapers, and the ways in which they cited and critiqued each other. A key aspect of the analysis is the role of historical memory, particularly concerning the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars, in shaping arguments for and against the intervention. The article also discusses the presence and actions of Bonapartists during the conflict, as well as the debates surrounding the war within the French parliament, highlighting key figures like Chateaubriand. Ultimately, the author argues that the differing interpretations of the past, especially regarding the French Revolution and Napoleon, influenced the political defeat of the liberals in the 1823-1824 elections.",

            "Both newspapers used official documents, private letters, and English newspapers as sources, with the 'Constitutionnel' citing liberal English newspapers like the 'Courier' and 'Morning Chronicle' and the 'Quotidienne' favoring the 'Courier' and 'New Times.'",

It examines how reporters used depictions of destroyed buildings and cities to denounce the devastation inflicted upon the Spanish people and highlight the barbarity of the fascist forces. The analysis focuses on the works of several reporters, including Simone Téry, Andrée Viollis, Marc Bernard, Jacob Altmaier, Georges Soria, Jean Fèvre, Hélène de la Souchère, Max Aub, Madeleine Jacob and Théresa Vandor, published in various French periodicals such as L'Humanité, Regards, La Lumière, Le Populaire, Vendredi, L'Œuvre and Ce Soir. The reports frequently describe Madrid, Barcelona, Belchite, Almeria, and other cities devastated by bombings, emphasizing the impact of the war on civilian life and the sense of loss and despair. The descriptions aim to evoke the reality of the war and denounce the non-intervention agreement. The article highlights the reporters' focus on the ruined cities to convey the human cost of the conflict, the destruction of homes, and the suffering of the Spanish population. The reports also highlighted the resilience and resistance of the Spanish people amidst the ruins.",

It highlights the unprecedented scale of asylum during the conflict, noting the actions of various countries and international organizations like Argentina, Norway, Chile, France, Mexico, Cuba, Panama, and Rumania. It also mentions the behavior of major powers like the United States, the Soviet Union, and Great Britain. The review also summarizes the book's analysis of the legal and socio-political aspects of asylum, the attitudes of the Republican and Burgos governments, the socio-professional and ideological backgrounds of those seeking asylum, and the conditions within asylum locations. Prisoner exchanges, particularly those involving the Basque Country, are also mentioned. The second book review concerns a book about a Moroccan tribe, the Beni Urriaguel, and does not directly relate to Spain, except for a brief mention of their historical practice of corsairs attacking primarily Spanish ships.

The author argues that the Spanish Civil War was a significant influencing factor in Belgian politics, particularly in relation to Belgium's foreign policy shift towards neutrality (\"La Politique d’Independence\") and internal political stability. The thesis examines the political divisions within Belgium caused by the conflict and analyzes Belgium's involvement in the Non-Intervention Committee. It also covers the existing historiography, primary sources, and the author's research methodology, which involves diplomatic documents, parliamentary minutes, and party archives. The author aims to contribute to the Spanish historiographical debate by demonstrating the interconnection between the Spanish Civil War and Belgian politics, placing the conflict within the broader context of interwar Europe.",

It explores the political and ideological divides of the conflict and the international responses, focusing on Latin America's role in supporting the Republican side through solidarity movements, intellectual engagement, and material aid, especially from Mexico. It also discusses the rise of pro-fascist organizations and the growth of German, Italian, and Japanese influence in Latin America. The document examines Latin American involvement in the International Brigades, the experiences of Spanish exiles in Latin America after the war, and the creation of support networks and cultural institutions by these exiles. It shows the complex relationship between Latin American governments (often cautious or supportive of Franco) and their populations (often sympathetic to the Republic).",

          "source_summary": "This text is a review of Spanish novels about the Spanish Civil War published after 1966. It discusses the resurgence of civil war novels after the loosening of press censorship, noting a shift toward representing the perspectives of both sides of the conflict, including the Republican side. The article examines various themes in these novels, such as life on the front lines, the experiences of non-combatants, the use of humor, the impact of the war on children, and the disillusionment of those who fought for Franco. It analyzes the different narrative techniques employed by authors, including flashbacks, first-person narratives, interior monologues, and experimental styles influenced by French and Latin American literature. The review also explores novels that depict the post-war period and the long-lasting impact of the conflict. The author, Maryse Bertrand de Munoz, concludes by assessing the overall quality of these novels and their potential to endure as historical testimonies or technical achievements, while noting the continued relevance of the war in the Spanish psyche.",

It examines the US Neutrality Acts of the 1930s and how they were applied, or not applied, to the conflict in Spain. The document details the internal debates within the US government, particularly between President Roosevelt, the State Department, and Congress, regarding the imposition and potential lifting of an arms embargo. It also explores the influence of figures like Ambassador Claude Bowers, the role of international diplomacy (especially concerning France and the United Kingdom), and the perceived threat of communism. The paper also covers the reasons why Roosevelt did not lift the embargo, including the existing political climate and the fact that both France and the UK were unwilling to change their stance and felt that a European war must be avoided until at least 1940. The article concludes that US policy remained one of non-interference, despite Roosevelt's personal sympathies with the Republican cause. The role of the Munich agreement is also discussed.",

It examines the intervention of the Soviet Union in the conflict, the diverse opinions within the Soviet Union regarding Spain, the information available to the Soviet public about the war, and the roles of key Soviet figures like Mikhail Koltsov and Ilya Ehrenburg in shaping Soviet perceptions. The document also discusses how the Spanish Civil War was viewed as a continuation of the Russian Revolution and how it influenced Soviet fears and hopes regarding a future global conflict. Specific Soviet actions, such as providing aid to the Republican side, are also discussed.",
          "extracted_key_facts": [
            "The Spanish Civil War ended seventy years prior to the document's writing (circa 2008), but academic debates about its history continued.",
            "The Soviet intervention in the Spanish Civil War was a highly debated issue.",
            "George Orwell criticized the USSR for betraying the Spanish revolution to appease Britain and France.",
            "Juan Negrín praised the Soviet Union's sincere and generous help.",
            "General Franco claimed the Soviet government aimed to sovietize the Spanish Republic.",
            "Between 1936 and 1939, several Soviet institutions were involved in foreign policy towards Spain, including the Comisariado del Pueblo de Asuntos Extranjeros, the Comintern, the Comisariado del Comercio Exterior, and the Politburo of the Communist Party.",
            "Stalin held the final decision-making power regarding Soviet policy in Spain.",
            "From the 1990s onward, the partial opening of Soviet archives allowed for new, more balanced perspectives on Soviet aid to Spain.",
            "The Spanish Civil War was experienced with uncommon intensity in the USSR.",
            "Maps of Spain showing republican advances were displayed in many Soviet homes.",
            "Soviet citizens generously collected money to aid the Spanish people, which was then used to pay for supplies sent by the USSR to Republican Spain.",

            "On August 4, 1936, Soviet newspapers significantly increased their coverage of Spanish news.",
            "On August 4, 1936, a mass rally of solidarity with the Spanish people was held in Red Square.",
            "On August 6, 1936, Mikhail Koltsov traveled from the USSR to France and met with the son of José Giral, who requested military aid from Moscow.",
            "From August 9, 1936, until November 1937, Mikhail Koltsov published his reports on the Spanish war almost daily in Pravda.",
            "The Soviet press also cited around forty Western newspapers in their reporting of the Spanish Civil War.",
            "The Soviet press avoided mentioning military assistance to the Republic and rarely referred to atrocities committed in Republican territory.",
            "The Spanish Revolution was presented by the Soviet press as a 'national' movement, not inspired from outside.",
            "In late 1936, the Party's publishing house released a pamphlet titled \"Heroic Spain\" to inform party propagandists about the situation in Spain.",
            "In the winter of 1936, the Bolshoi Theater featured Bizet's Carmen, with adaptations made to reflect the events in Spain.",
            "Ilya Ehrenburg was a close friend of Nikolai Bukharin and covered the Spanish Civil war extensively for Izvestia.",
            "Mikhail Koltsov was born in 1898 and worked for Pravda as a journalist, eventually becoming a key figure in Soviet policy toward Spain.",
            "Koltsov's book, 'Diario español' (1938), featured a character 'Miguel Martínez' believed to be a pseudonym for Koltsov himself or a composite of several individuals working as political advisors.",
            "By 1938, Koltsov was arrested under accusations of being a Trotskyist and fascist spy, and was executed.",
            "Some Russian White émigrés also fought on the side of Franco, viewing it as a fight against communism.",
            "In January 1937, Stalin personally ordered the Soviet Intelligence to organize the relocation to Spain of hundreds of Russian internationalist volunteers from France, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia, many of whom were White émigrés.",
            "Many perceived the Spanish Revolution as a 'second October', aiming to rectify past mistakes in the Russian Revolution.",
            "The civil war in Spain was viewed as a prelude to a future world war by many Soviet citizens.",
            "It is believed that between 1936 and June 1941 (when the Great Patriotic War began), the Soviets raised the equivalent of 1,272,374,000 French francs in solidarity, greatly exceeding any other nation's aid."

          "source_summary": "This document analyzes the involvement of France and Great Britain in the Spanish Civil War (which could be considered an instance of حرب مع إسبانيا), focusing on the strategic and political considerations that shaped their policies of non-intervention. The text discusses France's security concerns related to potential alliances between Spain and Germany or Italy, and how this affected their approach. It also highlights the internal political divisions within France and the strong pacifist sentiment, which limited the government's ability to actively support the Spanish Republic. It examines the origins of the non-intervention policy, the role of key figures like Léon Blum, and the pressures from both domestic and international actors. The article also describes the contribution of the French Communist Party to the International Brigades and the clandestine arms shipments facilitated by the French government. The British strategy is also analyzed and is shown to evolve from tacit neutrality to a more active policy, always aiming at european appeasement, which damaged the Spanish Republic. The document analyses the key events, individuals and ideas that affected the role of both France and Great Britain in the spanish conflict.",

It examines the role of Catalan publishers in promoting a 'Hispanic project,' including their commercial strategies, the importance of book associations, and connections with Argentine intellectuals through consular delegations and Spanish chambers of commerce. The article discusses the creation of Editorial Sudamericana in Buenos Aires in 1939, amidst the end of the Spanish Civil War, and the individuals involved, such as Rafael Vehils, Victoria Ocampo, and Oliverio Girondo. The article examines the business strategies of publishers like Emanuele Maucci and Ramón Sopena, and the role of organizations such as Casa de América of Barcelona and the Cámara Oficial del Libro de Barcelona in promoting book exports. It analyzes how Spanish publishers navigated competition from French and German publishers and addressed issues like transportation costs, tariffs, and intellectual property rights. The article also highlights the role of the Primera Guerra Mundial in opening up opportunities for Spanish publishers in Latin America. The article concludes by discussing the significance of Editorial Sudamericana within the context of Spanish exile and the broader development of the publishing industry in Argentina.",

The article details how the population of Madrid underwent a period of hypovitaminosis leading to the emergence of diseases such as pellagra, lathyrism, and a deficiency syndrome known as the Vallecas syndrome. The article highlights the work of researchers like Francisco Grande Covián, who studied the nutritional status of the Madrilenian population during and after the war, with the collaboration of the Rockefeller Foundation. The study investigates the clinical and neurological complications of nutritional deficiencies, including the prevalence of pellagra due to vitamin B deficiencies, the re-emergence of lathyrism due to chickling pea consumption during the post-war famine years (1941-1942), and the Vallecas syndrome characterized by muscle cramps and weakness among children from the Vallecas neighborhood. The article also connects the medical advancements made during this period, such as mobile blood transfusion units, to later developments in mobile surgical hospitals during World War II. Furthermore, the psychological impact of starvation, particularly in relation to pellagra, is explored, referencing the work of Bartolomé Llopis. Goya's depiction of famine during the Peninsular War is also mentioned in relation to the consumption of Almorta.",

It details the magazine's unwavering support for the Nationalist faction led by Franco, framing the conflict as a 'neocruzada' against communism and a defense of Catholic values. The article explores the magazine's editor, Monsignor Franceschi's views, justification of the military uprising, and concerns about the spread of communism in Argentina. It also examines the internal disputes within the Catholic community regarding the nature of the war and the role of Catholics in the conflict, focusing on the disagreement between Franceschi and Jacques Maritain. The source discusses the magazine's criticism of leftist media and political factions in Argentina and its support for anti-communist legislation.

            "The Argentine Catholic magazine 'Criterio' unequivocally supported the Nationalist faction in the Spanish Civil War.",
            "Monsignor Gustavo Franceschi, the editor of 'Criterio,' viewed the Spanish Civil War as a 'neocruzada' against communism in the 20th century.",
            "The magazine followed the events of the Spanish Civil War closely and with intense emotion.",
            "Argentine liberals, socialists, and radicals also felt politically invested in the events in Spain, organizing aid and activities for both sides.",
            "The magazine understood the Spanish Civil War as a heroic crusade and equated it with a holy war, though Franceschi also considered it a 'just war'.",
            "The magazine experienced internal division due to a disagreement between Jacques Maritain and Father Julio Meinvielle regarding the sanctity of the war.",
            "Franceschi believed the events in Spain served as a warning and lesson for Argentine society against a potential civil war.",
            "The magazine closely monitored the Spanish Republic and the rise of the Popular Front government in Spain from February 1936.",
            "In June 1936, 'Criterio' published an article titled 'La guerra civil en España' ('The Civil War in Spain'), which highlights concerns about the crisis of authority and the rise of violence.",
            "Franceschi argued that the Popular Front government in Spain was illegitimate due to fraudulent means of achieving power.",
            "According to 'Criterio', the 'leales' (loyalists) were actually the 'rebeldes' (rebels) because they represented anarchy, Marxism, and the denial of human freedom.",
            "Franceschi drew from the Thomist concept of sedition to justify the rebellion against a tyrannical government.",
            "The magazine saw the military uprising as a defensive reaction against the communist revolution.",
            "Franceschi defined communism as a materialistic, anti-spiritual, and anti-religious ideology.",
            "The magazine criticized Argentine media sympathetic to the Republic (Crítica, Noticias Gráficas, El Diario, Tribuna Libre) for biased reporting.",
            "The magazine warned against the formation of Popular Fronts in Argentina.",
            "Franceschi supported a law against communism in Argentina.",
            "The magazine portrayed the Spanish Nationalist side as defenders of Catholic identity.",
            "Franceschi traveled to Spain in late April 1937 to deliver aid and study the war firsthand.",
            "The magazine reported the destruction of Guernica as a result of intentional fires and bombings by the 'rojos' (reds).",
            "Franceschi favored Oliveira Salazar's regime in Portugal and believed Franco would establish a new Christian, Spanish, and modern state.",
            "Maritain publicly opposed the aerial bombings of Guernica and defended the Catholic Basque people.",
            "Julio Meinvielle accused Maritain of being an 'abogado de los rojos españoles' ('advocate of the Spanish reds').",
            "Franceschi believed that Maritain's position on the Spanish Civil War was erroneous and contradicted his theoretical teachings.",
            "The magazine criticized Maritain for publishing his ideas in the 'leftist' magazine 'Sur'.",
            "Criterio supported the idea of a Christian state, society guided by the Church, which could use force if the government were seditious and violated spiritual rights.",
            "The magazine framed the war as a fight between Christian civilization and its destruction by atheist communism."

It explores the transcultural aspects of their interactions, focusing on the musical strategies they used to overcome language barriers and build solidarity. The article analyzes how songs, both traditional and newly composed, played a crucial role in expressing identities, reinforcing unity, and navigating the complexities of intercultural coexistence in a war-torn environment. It also delves into the perception of \"foreigners\" on both sides of the conflict, examining how propaganda and lived experiences shaped these views. The author particularly highlights the significance of music in constructing and negotiating identities among the volunteers, addressing issues of class, nationality, and ideology and how music was used both to unite and differentiate groups. The article touches upon the tensions between different cultural groups (e.g., British and American volunteers) and the role of specific songs (e.g., Jarama Valley) in overcoming historical conflicts. It also contrasts the image of Spain presented to the outside world through figures like Carmen with the lived experiences and musical expressions of the volunteers and the Spanish population, embodied by the figure of Carmela. Finally, it suggests the importance of understanding the cultural and musical context of the Spanish Civil War to grasp the complexities of the conflict and the motivations of those who fought in it.",

The article analyzes how the Spanish Civil War was used as a lens through which local politics were viewed and contested, particularly concerning the conservative and Catholic opposition to the government of Amadeo Sabattini. The conservative opposition drew parallels between Sabattini's policies and the political situation in Spain, particularly with the Republican government, using the conflict to criticize Sabattini's actions and to promote federal intervention in Córdoba. The article examines the reactions of conservative and Catholic sectors to Sabattini's policies, including his stance against paramilitary organizations, his government's relationship with the Communist Party, his social policies, and the provincial government's position on pro- and anti-fascist clashes. It highlights the perception of Sabattini as a 'Largo Caballero' figure and the fear of an anarchistic revolution in Córdoba, mirroring the Spanish situation.",

It discusses how the novel revisits the war, focusing on the figure of Rafael Sánchez Mazas, a Falangist, and the Republican soldier who spared his life. The analysis explores the novel's critique of Francoist historical narratives, the transition to democracy in Spain, and the collective memory of the Civil War. It examines the novel's portrayal of the war as a foundational myth, the idealized representation of the Republican side, and its commentary on the political and cultural climate of contemporary Spain. The essay argues that the novel delves into the complexities of the Civil War by highlighting the differing recollections of the victors and the vanquished and questions the narrative of the Spanish transition to democracy.",

The article details specific exhumations of mass graves from the civil war period, mentioning locations like Priaranza del Bierzo (León) where the remains of 13 men killed in 1936 were exhumed, and the identification of Emilio Silva Faba through DNA analysis. It also discusses the exhumation of Bishop Manuel Irurita Almandoz from a mass grave in Barcelona in 1999. The document further outlines the normative framework surrounding these exhumations, referencing the Historical Memory Law (Ley 52/2007) and protocols for identifying and locating victims, highlighting the creation of maps of mass grave locations and outlining the necessary steps for exhumation processes, including preliminary reports, family requests, and forensic analysis. It mentions the number of mass graves exhumed (278) and skeletons recovered (over 5,000) up to the date of the article's publication, along with a compilation of reports and projects supported by the Ministry of the Presidency, and cites numerous related publications and legislative actions taken by various autonomous communities in Spain to address historical memory.",

          "source_summary": "This article examines the relationship between Mexico, the United States, and the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939). It argues that the Spanish Civil War significantly influenced bilateral relations between the Cárdenas government in Mexico and the Roosevelt administration in the US. Mexico provided military, diplomatic, and humanitarian aid to the Spanish Republic, while the US adopted a policy of non-intervention, including an arms embargo. The article explores how the fear of a similar rebellion in Latin America, particularly Mexico with the Saturnino Cedillo revolt, influenced Washington's stance on Mexican oil expropriation. Mexico also used the Spanish conflict to persuade the US to consider geopolitical implications over the oil dispute. The article discusses Mexico's diplomatic efforts in the League of Nations to support the Republic and its attempts to involve the US in mediating the conflict. It further analyzes the differing interpretations of the non-intervention principle and the impact of the oil nationalization in 1938 on US-Mexican relations, including the potential for Mexico to align with fascist powers. The article also highlights the complexities of the US response, balancing the Good Neighbor Policy with concerns about the spread of fascism and protecting American economic interests. Ultimately, the US chose a negotiated solution, avoiding a conflict similar to the Spanish Civil War in Mexico.",

            "The United States adopted a policy of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War, including an arms embargo against Spain in January 1937.",
            "The US justified its non-intervention policy as a consequence of its desire not to interfere in the affairs of another country and to avoid interfering with European diplomatic efforts.",
            "The fear of a rebellion in Latin America mirroring the Spanish Civil War, particularly the Saturnino Cedillo revolt in Mexico, influenced Washington's attitude towards Mexico's oil expropriation.",
            "The Cárdenas government used the 'pedagogical power' of the Spanish Civil War to convince Washington to subordinate the oil issue to broader geopolitical considerations.",
            "In January 1939, John Q. Tilson cited Mexico's open support for the Spanish Republic in arms shipments as evidence that the US could lift its embargo without risking war with fascist powers.",
            "Mexico's support for the Spanish Republic stemmed from solidarity between Mexican revolutionaries and Spanish Republicans, with the 1931 Spanish Constitution partly inspired by the 1917 Mexican Constitution.",
            "On August 10, 1936, Cárdenas ordered the shipment of 20,000 Mauser rifles and 20 million cartridges to Veracruz for transport to the Spanish Republic.",
            "Mexico attempted to act as an intermediary for the Spanish Republic in purchasing arms from the United States during the summer of 1936, but the US State Department refused.",
            "In January 1937, the US pressured Mexico to prevent the re-export of American aircraft to Spain to avoid undermining the US arms embargo.",
            "Mexico's diplomatic activism in support of the Spanish Republic was prominent in the League of Nations, where delegates Narciso Bassols and Isidro Fabela defended the Republic's right to acquire military supplies.",
            "Mexico tried to involve the United States as a diplomatic mediator in the Spanish Civil War, but Washington consistently declined.",
            "The differing interpretations of non-intervention between Mexico and the US, particularly concerning the Convention on Rights and Duties of States in the Event of Civil Strife (1928), revealed policy differences.",
            "Mexico's oil nationalization in 1938 indirectly involved Spain, as Cárdenas considered Spanish assistance in developing the oil industry and offered oil in exchange for credit.",
            "The Texaco oil company illegally sold oil on credit to Franco's faction, leading to US sanctions.",
            "The Mexican government was concerned that the expropiated oil companies might align with fascist powers and instigate a military insurrection, similar to the Spanish Civil War.",
            "In May 1938, a manifesto by Mateo Hernández Netro, then governor of San Luis Potosí, encouraged Mexicans to support a rebellion against Cárdenas under Saturnino Cedillo’s leadership, criticizing land politics and the nationalization of oil as anti-economic and antipatriotic.",
            "In March 1938, the US temporarily suspended the silver purchase program from Mexico as a form of economic pressure following the oil nationalization.",
            "US Ambassador Josephus Daniels advised the Mexican government to disregard the harsh note sent by Cordell Hull protesting the oil nationalization, averting a potential diplomatic crisis.",
            "Roosevelt feared a fascist revolution in Mexico supported by European powers, echoing the situation in Spain.",
            "By the spring of 1938, Cordell Hull was aware of the opinion within the State Department that the United States could easily find a revolt like Spain at their own door.",
            "In April 1938, the Secretary of the Interior of Mexico, Ignacio Garcia Tellez, publicly announced Mexico would take in Republican refugees in case of military defeat.",
            "Mexico played a significant role in the debate surrounding the American embargo of arms against Spain.",
            "The fear that a victory by Franco might encourage further intervention by Berlin and Rome in a Latin American nation, probably Mexico, affected Roosevelt's doubts and vacillations."

It explores the varied reactions of Latin American governments and public opinion towards the conflict, influenced by domestic issues, international context, and ideological affinities. The article details how Latin American countries were not strategically concerned by the war as much as European countries, and the debate was influenced by factors such as the relevance of the Spanish colony, the power of the clergy and the army, historical experience with Spain, strength of liberal institutions and political cultures. It highlights the initial sympathy of many Latin American governments towards the Nationalist faction due to ideological similarities with existing dictatorships and conservative leaders, contrasting it with the support for the Republican cause among democratic, socialist, communist, and antifascist groups. The neutrality policy adopted by most governments, influenced by the US's Good Neighbor policy, and the diplomatic and propagandistic efforts of both sides in Latin America are examined. The article also discusses the objectives, political actions, and propaganda strategies employed by both the Republican and Nationalist factions in Latin America, focusing on their attempts to gain diplomatic recognition, influence public opinion, and mobilize the Spanish emigrant communities. It also details the actions towards the colonies in America, showing the impact the war had on the colonies. Furthermore, it explains the difficulties faced by both sides in terms of resources, personnel, and coordination, as well as the different approaches they took in seeking support and spreading their message. The article concludes by stating that while the Republicans may have lost the war, they won the \"moral victory\" due to the effects of their propaganda in America, which damaged the image of Francoist Spain.",

It examines how Capa's image as the 'world’s best war photographer' was constructed and how Centelles was later presented as the 'Spanish Capa' or 'Catalan Capa'. The article analyzes media coverage and the role of symbolic objects like Centelles' suitcase of negatives in shaping their public personas. It also explores the historical context of photojournalism during the Spanish Civil War, including censorship, working conditions, and the impact of the conflict on the careers of both Spanish and foreign photographers. The piece delves into the debate surrounding Capa's famous 'Falling Soldier' photograph and the rediscovery of the 'Mexican suitcase' containing negatives from Capa, Taro, and Chim, further linking Capa and Centelles in the media. The article concludes that the media has contributed to reducing the complex history of war photojournalism to a few individuals, neglecting the contributions of many other professionals who documented the conflict.",

It further compares the careers and experiences of Capa and Centelles, highlighting their differing backgrounds and roles in the war, as well as the significance of objects like the Leica camera and Centelles's \"suitcase\" of negatives. The article argues that the focus on these two figures has eclipsed other important photographers of the Spanish Civil War and advocates for a more pluralistic understanding of the visual documentation of the conflict. It concludes that despite the extensive coverage, the photographic memory of the Spanish Civil War remains unfortunately reduced to the work of one foreign correspondent and one local photojournalist.",

While primarily an autobiographical piece, the text details Fraser's evolving interest in Spanish history, particularly the Spanish Civil War and the War of Independence. He discusses his initial attempts at fiction writing in Spain, his encounter with André Gorz, his work with the New Left Review, his turn to oral history, his research on the Spanish Civil War and the subsequent publication of \"Escondido\", his meeting with Gerald Brenan, and his later work on the social history of the War of Independence (1808-1814). The text describes his motivations, challenges and methodologies in researching and writing about these historical events, particularly focusing on the experiences of ordinary people. In conclusion it shows his return to writing and his appreciation for the support he has received from Spanish friends.",

            "Fraser met André Gorz (Gerard Horst), a journalist from L'Express, who introduced him to existentialism and Marxism.",
            "Fraser worked with the New Left Review in London, becoming familiar with Marxist thought.",
            "Oscar Lewis's \"Los hijos de Sánchez\" inspired Fraser to pursue oral history.",
            "Fraser interviewed former servants from his childhood home, leading him to delve into social history.",
            "Fraser's collaboration with Manuel Cortés, a former mayor of Mijas who had been in hiding since the Spanish Civil War, resulted in the book \"Escondido\".",
            "Fraser extensively researched the Spanish Civil War while interviewing Manuel Cortés.",
            "The publication of \"Escondido\" led to recognition and commissions for oral histories of Spanish villages.",
            "Fraser started a project to write a history of Mijas from the late 19th century through the early 1970s.",
            "Alistair Reid suggested that Fraser write an oral history of the Spanish Civil War.",
            "In 1973, Fraser began researching the Spanish Civil War in Córdoba, with the help of Carlos Castilla del Pino.",
            "Juan Martínez Alier introduced Fraser to an anarchosyndicalist from Castro del Río and his family, helping him find survivors of the war to interview.",
            "Fraser interviewed over 300 people involved in the Spanish Civil War over a two-year period.",
            "Fraser wrote the book \"Recuérdalo tú y recuérdalo a otros\" (Remember it You and Remember it to Others) about the Spanish Civil War.",
            "Fraser, after several years of therapy, wrote \"En busca de un pasado\" about his personal history using oral history.",

It argues that these works serve as a means of preserving historical memory, constructing identity in the face of loss and displacement, and challenging the dominant narratives of the Franco regime. The article examines specific autobiographies, including Vida en claro by José Moreno Villa, Recuerdos y olvidos by Francisco Ayala, Memoria de la melancolía by María Teresa León, Quan érem capitans by Teresa Pàmies, Una mujer por los caminos de España by María Lejárraga, and Memorias habladas, memorias armadas by Concha Méndez. It discusses the role of intellectuals during the war, the impact of the conflict on urban spaces like Madrid and Valencia, and the portrayal of anonymous victims of the violence. The author emphasizes the ethical imperative for exiled writers to bear witness to the war and its consequences.",

            "Exiled intellectuals used their memoirs to vindicate the Second Republic and fight the forgetfulness of the interior of Spain.",
            "These memoirs serve to reconstruct the identity of exiled individuals defined by a lost past and the need to readapt to a new society.",
            "Key autobiographies analyzed include Vida en claro (1944) by José Moreno Villa, Recuerdos y olvidos (1988) by Francisco Ayala, Memoria de la melancolía (1970) by María Teresa León, Quan érem capitans (1974) by Teresa Pàmies, Una mujer por los caminos de España (1952) by María Lejárraga, and Memorias habladas, memorias armadas (1990) by Concha Méndez.",
            "Over 160,000 Spaniards went into exile after the Spanish Civil War, including scientists, professors, writers, and artists.",
            "Many intellectuals, except those primarily focused on politics like Francisco Ayala, María Lejárraga, and Teresa Pàmies, were part of the Alianza de Intelectuales Antifascistas (Alliance of Anti-Fascist Intellectuals).",
            "The Alianza de Intelectuales Antifascistas engaged in activities such as literacy campaigns and the publication of El Mono Azul.",
            "María Teresa León and Rafael Alberti were among the most active intellectuals during the war, speaking at rallies and advocating for the Republican cause.",
            "The war transformed urban spaces, creating trenches, barricades, and other military installations.",
            "Madrid, under siege, became a mythical place of utopia, memory, and epopee in the Republican imagination.",
            "Valencia served as the capital of the Republic between November 1936 and October 1937 and became home to many intellectuals.",
            "Unlike Madrid, Valencia was depicted as a less dramatic, almost paradisiacal location, despite being subject to bombings.",
            "María Lejárraga, a member of parliament exiled after a few months of war, frames the outbreak of the conflict following the Second Republic as a pure allegory.",
            "The memories often rehabilitate the memory of anonymous victims of the war.",
            "The Spanish Civil War marked the exiled generation and became a leitmotif in much of their work."
