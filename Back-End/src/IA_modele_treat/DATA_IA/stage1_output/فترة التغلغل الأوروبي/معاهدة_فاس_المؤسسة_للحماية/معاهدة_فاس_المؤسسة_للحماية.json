Holden's research in Moroccan archives reveals primary sources that show Moroccans as active agents in the social history of trades, neighborhoods, and institutions within the medina. The article notes the segregation of the medina from the Ville Nouvelle, built for European use, by French administrators. It suggests that ordinary Moroccans were more concerned with local issues and relationships than with the French authorities. The paper focuses on the experiences of millers and butchers in Fez and discusses five types of documentation to reconsider Moroccan influence on urban development: municipal archives, archives of the Department of Fine Arts, documentation on religious endowments, land titles, and transcripts of judicial proceedings. The article touches on the French Protectorate era in Morocco, which began with the Treaty of Fez, thus it is related to the event \"معاهدة فاس المؤسسة للحماية\".",

The paper leverages a dataset of 58,000 georeferenced Moroccan individuals spanning from 1917 to 1955, using anthropometric data from military enrollment archives. The study investigates the effects of land concentration, water access, capital endowment, diversion of labor, and access to international markets, employing difference-in-difference and instrumental variables methodologies to estimate the colonization effect. The historical background section explicitly mentions the Treaty of Fès signed on March 30, 1912, which established the French Protectorate in Morocco, detailing the conditions that led to it, including the Cherifian Kingdom's indebtedness and internal conflicts. The paper further discusses the economic transformations that occurred after the treaty, such as infrastructure development, private investments, and the disruption of national production through colonial agriculture.",

However, French remained the language of the upper classes and is required for fluency in key sectors.

The source uses letters and official bulletins from the Centre des Archives Diplomatiques de Nantes (CADN) to illustrate the relationship between French authorities and Moroccan leaders, including Moulay Youssef. It details the efforts to maintain order, promote progress, and preserve Moroccan traditions under the protectorate. Lyautey's policies aimed at pacification, infrastructure development, and educational reforms while preserving the authority of the Makhzen and showing respect for Islamic institutions are examined. The source mentions the establishment of Franco-Berber schools and the reorganization of Islamic higher education.",

It begins by mentioning the Treaty of Algeciras (1906) and the Treaty of Fez (1912), which established the French and Spanish Protectorate over Morocco. The article then focuses on the changes brought about by French colonizers, including land reclamation, farm mechanization, and rural resettlement schemes. It highlights the transformation of the Gharb valley through investments in infrastructure such as dams, drainage systems, and irrigation perimeters. The article also discusses the demographic shifts, including rural exodus and urbanization, and the strategies employed by the French colonial administration to address these issues, such as the resettlement schemes conceived by Michel Écochard. The study concludes that these policies, while aiming to modernize the region and improve living conditions, also served to reinforce colonial domination and widen the gap between modern and traditional agricultural sectors. The research highlights the connection between French repopulation policies, rural modernization, and colonial strategies for resource extraction, emphasizing the lasting impact of these interventions on the region's development.",

Some colonial subjects, like Algerian Jews, were made full citizens of France, while others, like Algerian Muslims, had French nationality but were barred from full political rights and thus weren't considered citizens. The text also takes a transnational approach, examining the colonial Maghreb in the context of the Ottoman Empire and tracing the impact of colonial regimes of legal belonging in metropolitan France.

Preliminary negotiations between the Foreign Minister of Morocco and the Committee of Control led to the integration of the Tangier zone with the rest of Morocco, with authorities signing an interim agreement on July 5, 1956, replacing the Administrator with a Governor appointed by the Sultan, and bringing the police under Moroccan national control.",

The paper discusses the economic and political factors contributing to the colonization, including European debt imposition on Morocco, trade imbalances, and the roles of key figures like Budgett Meakin, Walter Harris, and General Lyautey. It also explores Moroccan resistance and the shift in historical narratives after independence.

It explores how mining, driven by the needs of colonial powers, led to the appropriation of land and resources, creating imbalances of power and structural violence. The article examines the history of specific mines in these regions, including Mibladen and Zeïda in the Moroccan Middle Atlas. It notes that the treaties of Algeciras and Fez, which established the French protectorate in Morocco, also included provisions for addressing mining conflicts, highlighting the strategic importance of mining during the French colonization period. The study emphasizes how the benefits of mining rarely remained local, with profits and management concentrated in Paris, even after independence.

It analyzes how French courts and sharīʿa courts adjudicated land preemption disputes, considering the impact of the colonial land registration system (immatriculation foncière) and codified versions of Islamic law. The article argues that French courts created a hybrid version of Islamic property law where immatriculation supplanted traditional Islamic legal modes of proof, resulting in a competing and exclusionary version of sharīʿa. The study relies on sharīʿa and French court records, Islamic legal texts, colonial legislation, and French archives to support its claims. It explores the status of Islamic law and property in the Protectorate, particularly the founding Sharifian Decrees, the Moroccan-Mālikī norms of shufʿa, and paradigmatic cases adjudicated in both sharīʿa and French courts, examining the impact of codification and land bureaucracy. The article also examines specific examples such as 'knowledge' of a co-owner's sale, the 'true' sale price, and the importance of the property immatriculation process, tying the legal changes to the broader historical narrative of French colonial rule in Morocco after 1912.",

The article discusses the concept of international agency, where one subject of international law acts on behalf of another, and the legal consequences thereof. The author, Angelo Piero Sereni, uses the Treaty of Fez (March 30, 1912) as an example to illustrate the application of international agency in establishing protectorates. The article explains that when a state, duly authorized, concludes a treaty for another state, the latter is bound by the treaty as if it had concluded the treaty itself. This principle applies to situations where one state represents another in international relations, leading to a split between the acting international person and the person to whom the legal effects are attributed. This legal framework helps in understanding the international law principles at play in the Treaty of Fez and the establishment of the French Protectorate in Morocco.",

The chapter discusses France's colonial empire-building project in North Africa, starting with the annexation of Algeria in 1830, and its attempts to impose a French image on the region's built environment. It highlights the strategies employed by French colonial authorities to replace indigenous structures with French ones, also noting that French influence extended even to North African countries, such as Egypt, that were colonized by Britain. The text further mentions the French colonial policies of assimilation and association, arguing that these policies aimed to reinforce France's control over the region. It also makes note of the post-colonial shift of the building used during the protectorate, in Morocco after its independence in 1956.",

It aims to identify the reasons for the different outcomes. The thesis examines the historical context of both territories, including the Treaty of Fez (1912) which established the French Protectorate and the subsequent agreements with Spain that created the Spanish zone. It discusses the political framework, administrative structure, ideological approaches to colonialism (Africanismo, Orientalism, citizenship), nationalist struggles for independence, the Ifni-Sahara War, and the social impact of decolonization, including the perspectives of both indigenous and Spanish populations. The research questions address the status of the territories and inhabitants during Spanish rule, the socio-political situations leading to independence, and the experiences of indigenous and Spanish populations after the Spanish withdrawal. The source outlines its methodology, source criticism, and the scientific relevance of the topic, highlighting the lack of comparative analyses between Morocco and Western Sahara in existing literature.",

It argues that the intrusion of politics into Moroccan higher education began before the French protectorate, increased during the protectorate era, and continued after Moroccan independence. The abstract also states that numerous reforms have been implemented in an effort to improve the university system, but these reforms often share a similar pattern: an ambitious political vision, difficult consultations, promulgation of laws, varying media coverage, and ultimately, less-than-enthusiastic implementation, resulting in student attrition and unemployment.",

It highlights the paradox that French recognition of Moroccan independence was hastened by internal divisions stemming from the radicalization of Moroccan nationalism.

France ultimately conceded control over foreign policy and defense to reinforce Mohammed V's authority and co-opt el-Fassi and the Istiqlal into the political regime. The French aimed for state sovereignty in Morocco without necessarily ensuring popular sovereignty, a departure from their approach in Tunisia.",

The Rif War, lasting from 1909 to 1927, involved clashes between Spanish and French colonial forces and the Rifians led by Abd El-Krim. The Treaty of Fez allowed Spain to establish a protectorate over the North Moroccan Rifians after France had been unable to pacify the territory. The article focuses primarily on the biography of Elvira López Mourín, a nurse who participated in the first Spanish sanitary flight during the Rif War in 1922. While the primary focus is on the nurse's biography, the historical background, including the Treaty of Fez's role in establishing the Spanish Protectorate and setting the stage for the Rif War, is present in the document.",

The analysis directly relates to the events surrounding and leading up to the establishment of the French Protectorate following the Treaty of Fez (30 March 1912) as it highlights the attitudes and resistance encountered by the French colonial forces, and the Makhzen’s power during that period. The document examines the role of key figures like Caid Tayeb Outgountaft who was tasked with subduing rebellious tribes after the Treaty of Fez, and refers back to the earlier challenges faced by Si Said Aguelloul in establishing central authority.

It details the colonial oppression, economic exploitation, and social inequalities imposed by the French, contrasting the 'civilizing mission' narrative with the harsh realities faced by the Moroccan population. The text covers the control of key infrastructures like the port of Tangier, the appropriation of fertile lands for European settlers, the discriminatory education system, and the overall denial of basic rights to the Moroccans. It emphasizes the power held by French administrators and the marginalization of Moroccan institutions. The historical context, including the rivalry between European powers and the eventual French domination solidified by the treaty, is explored. Specific instances, like the limited access to education and healthcare for Moroccans compared to Europeans, are highlighted to illustrate the colonial policies in practice.",

It examines how the French colonial empire expanded and the ideological justifications that were developed to reconcile colonial domination with republican values. The chapter, titled \"La France coloniale,\" analyzes the contradictions between republican ideals and colonial practices, highlighting the economic and military interests that drove colonial expansion. It suggests that colonialism profoundly impacted French society and its collective unconscious, and that the study of colonies should be integrated into the broader history of France. The text emphasizes the advancements in the study of French colonial history since the late 20th century and critiques earlier historical accounts that served to justify colonial endeavors. While it doesn't directly mention the Treaty of Fez, its discussion of the expansion and ideology of French colonialism within the timeframe is highly relevant to understanding the context in which the treaty was created.",

The document also covers the role of marabouts in the groundnut expansion, specifically focusing on the Mouride brotherhood and its relationship with the French colonial administration. While the document does not focus on the Treaty of Fez directly, it is relevant because it discusses the protectorate treaty imposed by the French on Guédel Mbodj, king of Saloum, in 1887 after French military intervention, which is part of the broader context of French colonial expansion and establishment of protectorates in the region. The text further describes subsequent marabout rebellions against the French and the eventual reconciliation between Cheikh Ahmadou Bamba, the founder of Mouridism, and the colonial authorities, driven by economic interests in groundnut production.

It highlights the growing European influence and the internal power struggles within the Makhzen, the ulama, and Sufi brotherhoods like the Kattaniyya.

However, it argues that independence was a gradual process, highlighting the return of the Sultan on November 16, 1955, the proclamation of independence by nationalists shortly after, and the nomination of the first independent government on December 7, 1955. The chapter also points out that the abolition of the Treaty of Fez did not immediately remove all limitations on Moroccan sovereignty, citing the Anglo-Moroccan treaty of 1856 and the Act of Algeciras of 1906 as examples of pre-protectorate agreements that continued to impact Morocco's sovereignty after 1956 and had to be addressed separately.

It discusses the historical context of French as the language of the colonial administration after 1912 and its impact on Moroccan society, including education and technology transfer following the Treaty of Fez (معاهدة فاس). It highlights how the French language became associated with modernization and the elite, while Arabic was linked to national identity and religion. The text explores the paradox of increased francization after independence, the complexities of arabization, and the socio-political implications of language choices in post-colonial Morocco. The document also examines the ideological underpinnings of language use in media and education and investigates the role of technology in perpetuating linguistic dominance. It concludes by arguing that the linguistic landscape reflects underlying power dynamics and socio-economic inequalities, tracing these back to the colonial era initiated by the Treaty of Fez.",

The abstract mentions that Prost was among the first to use aerial views in his master plan studies, especially in Morocco from 1914 to 1922. These aerial photographs aided in assessing locations, creating accurate maps, and developing action plans and intervention principles. The article aims to examine how Prost employed aerial views, particularly in the development of the master plan for the Paris region. Although the primary focus is Paris, the initial reference to Prost's work in Morocco during the years 1914-1922, which is the period leading up to and immediately following the Treaty of Fez (1912), makes it relevant. This is due to the likelihood that the \"master plan studies\" included urban planning aspects directly influenced by the establishment of the French Protectorate, providing a potential indirect link to the event in question.",

While the main focus is on Prost's work in Paris, it also mentions his prior experience in Morocco (1914-1922), where he used aerial photography for urban planning in cities like Rabat, Fes, Marrakech, and Meknes. It explains Prost's approach to urban planning, which involved a detailed analysis of existing structures and forces, and his methods of investigation, including drawing, cartography, and aerial photography. The document does not focus on the specifics of the treaty, but it details the urban planning context in which Prost worked in Morocco, which is temporally relevant, indirectly referencing the establishment of the French Protectorate and the urban planning activities undertaken during that period. The document emphasizes the importance of aerial views in understanding and reshaping urban spaces and their relation to the landscape, which could be used to analyze French strategies in Morocco during the protectorate. The document also explores Prost's transition from traditional architectural representation to using photography as a tool for urban planning and how aerial photography transformed urban planning practices. It covers the challenges Prost faced in implementing his plans for Paris, including the lack of financial resources and administrative coordination, as well as his later success in Istanbul.",

Annex 1 also includes maps, one of which directly represents Morocco in 1912 and the establishment of the French and Spanish protectorates, illustrating the geo-political circumstances linked to the Treaty of Fez. The inclusion of these historical documents makes the source relevant to understanding the historical context, tensions, and policies concerning the Amazigh population during the Protectorate period, even though the main research of the doctoral thesis is not primarily historical.",

The treaty's impact on creating a dual administrative system (French and Makhzen) is mentioned, serving as a historical context for understanding modern administrative structures.",

            "The bureaucracy created by the Saadians persisted under the Alaouites and underwent reforms, notably under Hassan I.",

The article, titled \"La administración de territorios: del protectorado a la administración territorial internacional,\" examines the institutional evolution of territorial administration by third parties, specifically the distinction between protectorates and international territorial administration. The author argues that while these two forms of administration share some similarities, they differ in their objectives, legal basis, context, and international requirements for legality, legitimacy, and effectiveness. The author posits that protectorates served the strategic, economic, or military interests of great powers and formalized hierarchical relationships, whereas international territorial administration is primarily used to protect the general interests of the international community, such as peace and fundamental human rights. The article also mentions concepts such as territorial sovereignty and suspended sovereignty.",

It then specifically mentions the establishment of the Spanish Protectorate in Morocco (1912-1956), referencing the conventions of 1912 and the subsequent military action and pacification efforts. The paper outlines the administrative structure, territorial organization, and the areas of Spanish action such as education, health, infrastructure and social life. It touches on the end of the protectorate and draws comparisons with later international actions, particularly in Afghanistan, highlighting similarities in the challenges faced. The document includes quantitative and qualitative analyses, based on archival research and interviews, focusing on the social actions carried out by the Spanish army in the protectorate, and presents the historical context as antecedent to stabilization operations.",

It details how the French government, through the Protectorate, sought to control Moroccan society, including its education system, to perpetuate its rule. The article discusses the various types of education that existed during the Protectorate, including original Islamic education, French education, education for the Moroccan elite, Berber education, and Jewish education. The text also explores the nationalist movement's response through the creation of a \"free\" nationalistic education. After independence in 1956, the Moroccan government aimed to reform the education system based on four principles: generalization, Arabization, unification, and Marroquization. It analyzes the challenges and successes of these principles in shaping the modern Moroccan education system, highlighting the tensions between traditional Islamic values, French influence, and Berber identity within the educational framework. The article connects the educational policies to the broader socio-political context, demonstrating how education was used as a tool for social control and nation-building in Morocco.",

          "source_summary": "This text discusses the legal system in Morocco under the Spanish Protectorate, focusing on the indigenous justice system and its use as a tool for political and social control. It details the pre-colonial judicial system, divided into cherifiana (cheránica and majzeniana), Berber customary law, and rabbinical jurisdictions. It examines the reorganization of the judicial system under the Spanish Protectorate after the Franco-Moroccan Treaty of 1912, highlighting the subordination of Moroccans to Spanish legislation despite the preservation of indigenous jurisdictions. The text elaborates on the structure, regulations, and functions of these special jurisdictions, including Islamic and rabbinic tribunals, emphasizing their role in controlling the Moroccan population, particularly in rural areas. The study also discusses the instrumentalization of the Jewish community and the control over Islamic justice through Habús and other jurisdictions. It mentions the differing approaches of Spanish and French administrations towards Berber customary law. The conclusion asserts that despite official claims of judicial independence, Spanish intervention in indigenous justice was a consistent practice during the protectorate, aiming to control the population and co-opt local authorities.",

            "The Dahir of December 26, 1934, and its extension on October 19, 1938, regulated cheránica justice, limiting the attributions of the cabila cadíes to issues of personal status, reserving real estate matters to the circumscription cadíes.",

It explores the interactions between Spanish officials and Moroccan authorities, specifically the Pasha, revealing a system of reciprocity where corruption flourished. The study uses an unpublished administrative record opened to officials in the Oficina de Intervención Local de Alcázarquivir in 1925 to reveal corrupt practices between Spanish officials and the Pasha of the city. The Pasha was allowed to maintain his abuses against the local population in exchange for sustaining a social order desired by the colonial authorities. It argues that the colonial power structure was precarious and susceptible to corruption due to organizational disarray and the ongoing Rif War. The article also touches upon pre-existing forms of corruption and clientelism within the Moroccan 'Majzen' (government) system, where local officials gained profits through mediation and exploitation. This system continued under Spanish rule, with Spanish officials also engaging in corrupt practices like manipulating auctions, controlling prostitution, and mismanaging 'habus' (religious endowments). The article concludes that while the Spanish Protectorate established a formal legal-rational framework, it coexisted with a patrimonialist system where corruption thrived, impacting both Moroccans and Spaniards. The study highlights the complex interplay between colonial and local power structures and challenges simplistic cultural explanations of corruption.",

While the Tratado de Fez (Treaty of Fez) of 1912, which formally established the Spanish Protectorate in Morocco, is briefly mentioned, the document's main thrust is the location, accessibility, cataloging, and preservation of colonial archives in various Spanish institutions and the challenges faced by researchers in accessing these resources. The document details the dispersion of colonial documents across different archives (AGA, AHN, military archives, etc.), the limitations in existing catalogs, restrictions imposed by data protection and official secrets laws, and the physical state of preservation of the documents. It calls for an updated guide to sources, improved access to the Africa Section of the AGA, and modifications to legislation hindering access to information. The significance of these archives for understanding Spanish colonial history and the shared past with Morocco, Sahara, and Guinea are emphasized.",

An approach from the military archives of Ceuta and Melilla). The article studies the actions carried out by the Spanish army in the Protectorate of Morocco between 1927 and 1956. It analyzes the protectorate formula and the organizational structure employed by the Spanish action in the area. It examines the social intervention of the Army in aspects of education, health, infrastructure, and social life. The study uses data from the Military Archives of Melilla and Ceuta to characterize the social action of the Spanish army in this period. It concludes that this action followed the logic of a modernization process through intervention in the four areas, starting with infrastructures and gradually providing basic services to improve the life of both Moroccans and the Spanish population. While it doesn't directly mention the treaty itself, it concerns the protectorate established *by* the treaty.",

It examines the internal political and economic situation in Spain during this period, including university strikes and labor unrest. The article also explores Spain's relations with the Arab world, Ibero-America, and the West, as well as its secret overtures to the USSR and its satellite states. It explains the Spanish government's communication strategies to present the independence of Morocco as a benevolent act and to emphasize Spain's role as a mediator between the West and the Arab world. It includes a detailed account of the visit of Mohammed V to Spain, the negotiations that took place, and the joint declaration of independence. The article also touches on Spain's relations with other Arab leaders, such as Faisal II of Iraq and Saud of Saudi Arabia. Finally, it analyzes how the Spanish government used media and propaganda to control the narrative surrounding Morocco's independence and present a positive image of Franco's regime both domestically and internationally.",

While it doesn't directly address the signing of the Treaty of Fez establishing the protectorate (معاهدة فاس المؤسسة للحماية), it does provide crucial context regarding the evolving relationship between Spain and Morocco after independence. The text covers Hassan II's accession to the throne, the resolution of conflicts in Ifni and the Sahara, and Morocco's ongoing claims to territories held by Spain (Ifni, Western Sahara, Ceuta, and Melilla).

It mentions the 'Agreement of Fez' in 1969 where Franco ceded Ifni in exchange for fishing rights, it also covers Moroccan efforts to establish a constitutional monarchy, economic agreements with foreign powers, and Hassan II's role in Arab politics. Furthermore, the text explores attempts to remove Hassan II from power and details complex relationships between Morocco, Spain, and other Western powers during the period.

While it doesn't explicitly mention the 'معاهدة فاس المؤسسة للحماية' (Treaty of Fez establishing the Protectorate), it provides crucial context to the events leading up to it, specifically Spanish involvement in the region prior to the treaty. The article traces the evolution of Spanish colonial ambitions in the Sahara, driven by economic interests (fishing), geopolitical considerations (Canary Islands security), and the influence of colonialist movements. It discusses key figures like Cánovas del Castillo, and examines the interplay of national and international factors shaping Spanish policy, particularly in relation to Morocco and other European powers. The source highlights Spain's initial defensive colonial posture, its interest in Santa Cruz de Mar Pequeña (Ifni), and the eventual proclamation of a protectorate over the Western Sahara in 1884. The article also delves into the complexities of Moroccan sovereignty over the region and the competing interpretations thereof. Therefore, even though it predates the Treaty of Fez, its in-depth examination of the historical, economic, and political conditions of the region makes it highly relevant to understanding the historical context in which the treaty was signed.",

The article highlights how the establishment of the Spanish Protectorate in 1912 led to new artistic perspectives, particularly through painters like Mariano Bertuchi who worked within the colonial administration. It ends by discussing the decline of Orientalist painting after Moroccan independence.",

It analyses how these writers portrayed Moroccan society, culture, and the impact of the French and Spanish protectorates. The article explores their perspectives on the city of Fez, Moroccan society in the 1920s and 1930s, gender roles, religion, architecture, education, and the interplay between multiculturalism and interculturality during the colonial period. It also discusses the authors' backgrounds, influences, and writing styles, contrasting their visions of Morocco with European orientalist stereotypes. The article ultimately seeks to understand the image of Morocco in early 20th-century Hispanic-American travel literature and the extent to which these writers departed from or reinforced existing European narratives. The text explicitly references the historical and sociopolitical context of Morocco under the French and Spanish protectorates, making it relevant to understanding the environment created by the Treaty of Fez, which established the protectorate.",

It examines the US's growing interest in global affairs and its attempts to influence the legal status of Morocco. The article highlights the US's limited strategic and material interests in the region and how its attitude was often shaped by its perceptions of the conflicting actors, particularly France and Spain. The US grew wary of France's actions in the Alawi Protectorate and considered supporting Spain to counterbalance them. However, the US's support for Spain was contingent on a significant change in the US's perceptions of the Spanish government and its character. The article discusses the US involvement in the Algeciras Conference, its concerns about French monopolistic aspirations in Morocco, its evolving views of Spain's capacity for successful colonization, and the Anglo-American collaboration at the Versailles Peace Conference to shape the future of Morocco. It details US attitudes towards the Tangier question and the evolving perspectives on France and Spain throughout the 1920s, highlighting the influence of stereotypes and the perceived impact of Primo de Rivera's dictatorship on US policy.",
