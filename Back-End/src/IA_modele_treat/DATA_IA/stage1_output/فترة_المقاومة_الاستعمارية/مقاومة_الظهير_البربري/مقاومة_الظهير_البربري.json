The publication of the Berber Dahir on May 16, 1930, is identified as a pivotal moment that spurred new political dynamics and ultimately contributed to the independence movement.

The article examines documents from the League of Nations archives pertaining to the Berber Dahir of May 16, 1930. The introduction highlights the Dahir's significance as a turning point in the Moroccan national movement. It marks a shift from armed resistance in rural areas, weakened after the defeat of Ibn Abd-el-Krim El-Khattabi's revolt in 1926, to new forms of struggle in urban centers. The Dahir acted as a catalyst, unifying and strengthening the Moroccan national movement by fostering a sense of shared religious (Islamic) and national (Arab) identity. The rise of Arab nationalism ('urûba) is also noted, demonstrating a shift in the basis of the movement. The document also mentions letters of protest from the Pan-Islamic Congress and the Associations of Young Muslims from other Arab regions, showing international awareness and reaction to the Dahir.",

While the document itself does not delve directly into the \"مقاومة الظهير البربري (المغرب)\" (Berber Dahir Resistance) it provides a broad framework for understanding resistance movements against the modern state in Morocco, of which the Berber Dahir Resistance is a part of. The introduction discusses the historical context of state formation, domination, and resistance, citing the Berber resistance against the Roman Empire as an example of early Berber resistance. It also discusses colonial domination and its impact. Furthermore, by focusing specifically on the Hirak movement, which represents a later form of Amazigh (Berber) protest within the Moroccan state, the text establishes a clear line of inquiry into the ongoing tensions between the Moroccan state and Berber populations, which helps contextualize the earlier Berber Dahir Resistance as part of a longer historical pattern.",

It details the colonial context leading to the Dahir, which divided the French Protectorate into areas governed by Sharia law and Berber customary law. The protests, centered around the recitation of the latif (collective prayers), originated in Salé and spread to other cities like Rabat, Fez, and Casablanca. The author discusses the role of these protests in unifying an emerging nationalist movement, gaining support from within Morocco and abroad. The text delves into the motivations of the protesters, the French colonial policies that sparked the unrest, and the international reactions, highlighting the role of pan-Arabist figures like Chakib Arsalan. It also examines how the Dahir and the protests have been interpreted and remembered in subsequent decades, particularly with the rise of Berber movements challenging the dominant Arab nationalist narrative. The analysis stresses that the Dahir was framed as a tool for Christianizing Berbers and dividing the country, even though the actual text of the Dahir didn't explicitly promote this division.",

          "source_summary": "This article provides a socio-historical perspective on the Amazigh (Berber) Cultural Movement in North Africa, with a focus on Morocco and Algeria. It discusses the historical context of the Berber people, their language and culture, and the challenges they have faced. A key point is the analysis of the 'Berber Decree' (Dahir Berbere) of 1930 in Morocco, which, while formalizing existing tribal law systems for Berber-speaking areas, was viewed by pan-Arab nationalists as an attempt to divide Berbers from Arabs and was a crucial event in the history of the Berber cultural movement. The article also touches on the Berber Spring of 1980 in Algeria, the creation of institutions for Berber language and culture studies, and the recent inclusion of Berber in the educational systems of Morocco and Algeria. Furthermore, it examines the constitutional rights (or lack thereof) afforded to Berber speakers in Morocco and Algeria compared to other African and Muslim countries. The article argues that pan-Arab nationalism has been a significant factor hindering the recognition of Berber identity and language.",

It examines how Moroccan writers have navigated these complexities, often writing in both French and Arabic, and engaging with both local and international literary traditions. The study focuses on Ben Jelloun's novel as a semi-fictional memoir based on Aziz Binebine's experiences in Tazmamart prison after the Skhirat coup attempt in 1971. It analyzes the novel's portrayal of torture, body, and voice representations, linking them to broader themes of resistance, survival, and the human spirit's capacity to endure inhumane conditions. The article also delves into the political context of King Hassan II's reign, the failed coups, and the subsequent human rights abuses, highlighting the role of literature as a form of witnessing and resistance against oppressive regimes. The analysis includes examination of how political prisoners associate writing with their quest for freedom, touching upon themes of national identity, cultural openness, and the impact of Western culture on Moroccan values. Furthermore, it analyzes the different types of silence and resistance that Salim, the protagonist, experiences, ultimately arguing that resistance and survival are the most important themes of political prison stories.",

This myth, which attributed specific qualities to Berber people in Algeria and Morocco, was used to justify a 'divide and conquer' strategy by colonial powers. The article argues that by promoting Arabic language dominance at the expense of Berber languages, the colonial governments further reinforced the idea of North Africa as solely 'Arab and Muslim.'

The book examines the role of women artists in unlocking traditions and emancipating women since the 1960s in Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia. It also addresses why Maghrebi women have been largely excluded from political discourse since their countries gained independence. The introduction highlights the importance of women's artistic voices in the Maghreb, particularly in cinema, politics, and the arts. It also explores how Maghrebi women resist patriarchy from a different perspective than Western feminists. The volume uses Kahina, a Berber leader who fought against the Arab invasion of North Africa in the 7th century CE, as a symbol of female resistance and memory. The introduction examines the contribution of entrenched traditional institutions favoring patriarchy to the detriment of women. It also touches upon the feminist Hirak movement in Algiers in 2019, and today’s cyberactivism. The book is divided into two parts: Women and Political Transformations in the Maghreb and Women's Resistance and Literary, Cinematic, and Artistic Expressions. It concludes that women in the Maghreb are double minorities, subjugated by patriarchal tradition and the constraints of religion. The book as a whole aims to reiterate the experiences and struggles of women in the Arab-Muslim world of North Africa.",

The article highlights the contributions of Sufi orders and Salafist movements to the resistance against colonialism, emphasizing the importance of national spirituality – an alliance of nationalism and Islam – as an inspirational ideology for liberation movements. The article details the involvement of various Sufi brotherhoods and Salafist leaders in anti-colonial struggles in the Maghreb, discussing their impact on shaping social and political life and their role in resisting Western cultural and political dominance. It examines the Berber Dahir of 1930 and its impact on unifying Arabs and Berbers against French rule, as well as the creation of free schools by anticolonial Salafists to resist assimilation. The article concludes that anticolonialism in the Maghreb, including Morocco and Algeria, had Islamic roots, and that a blend of Western ideas and Islamic ideologies inspired resistance movements. It argues that postcolonial studies should include a richer legacy of Islamic liberation theology.",

The Convention of Marsa on June 8, 1883, further granted France the right to intervene in Tunisian domestic affairs, placing Tunisia under the control of the French Resident-General. Morocco became a protectorate under the Treaty of Fez on March 30, 1912, with a coastal area along the Strait of Gibraltar ceded to Spain, excluding the Tangier zone in November 1912. The Treaty of Fez allowed France to occupy parts of Morocco under the pretext of protecting the sovereign and maintaining indirect rule through the Sultan and Sharifian government. The French Resident-General gained the sole right to represent Morocco in foreign countries, effectively stripping both countries of autonomy in external and internal affairs. The French authorities in Morocco implemented the Berber Policy, attempting to separate Berber and Arab ethnic groups to consolidate French rule, under the assumption that Berbers were more susceptible to French law and culture.",

The chapter explores how emerging voices, characterized as polyvocal and leaderless, challenge the state on issues such as sexual harassment, Amazigh (Berber) language rights, and individual freedoms, even without explicitly identifying as feminist.",

It argues that customary law was a colonial invention used to divide the Moroccan nation and that its rediscovery is linked to identity politics and struggles over land and resources. The article highlights how colonial administrators and scholars formalized customs into customary law, leading to indignation and fueling nascent nationalism among young urban men with Islamic reformist leanings. It further discusses how after independence, nationalists denied the existence of Berber law and language, but this narrative changed again at the beginning of the 21st century with a rediscovery of Berber culture and language. The article also examines the roles of various actors, including colonial administrators, scholars, nationalist thinkers, and local activists, in shaping the understanding and use of customary law. It suggests that popular culture, including Berber customary law, is often shaped by elite actors and used as a tool for debate and administration at both national and local levels. The Dahir berbère of 1930, confirming the division of Morocco into zones governed by Islamic or customary law, is identified as a catalyst for protests and the rise of a counter-narrative emphasizing national unity based on Islam and Arabism. The article points out that the Berber customs became an essential part of national heritage after the establishment of the Royal Institute for Amazigh Culture (IRCAM).",

          "source_summary": "This paper explores the relationship between religious and political legitimacy in the Moroccan monarchy by examining three historical moments. The paper introduces the concepts of Laicism and Judeo-Christian Secularism, and then proposes a boundary-focused approach to the analysis of religion in order to examine how the relationship between the religious and political spheres was constructed or renegotiated in each of these moments. These moments are (1) the collapse of the Sa’adian Dynasty and the challenge from the Dila Zawiya; (2) the \"Berber Revolts\" against 'Alawi Sultan Moulay Sliman's reformist efforts in the early 19th century; and (3) the independence movement and the role of Sultan Muhammed V and the Istiqlal party in ending the French protectorate. The paper argues that these moments demonstrate the profound link between political and religious legitimacy within the Moroccan context, where the Sultan's religious authority significantly impacts political dynamics. Regarding the Berber Dahir, the paper says it unified salafi and nationalist sentiments and was viewed as an assault on Muslim identity. The paper analyzes how the relationship between the religious and political was renegotiated in each of these moments. The paper analyzes the Berber Dahir of 1930, seeing it as reinforcing the existing juridical structure. Berber tribes had long established their own juridical practices and were rarely subject to the shari'a courts used by Morocco's more urban, Arabized population. The independence movement, however, saw the edict as an attempt to interfere in Morocco's religious affairs and a move on the part of the French to co-opt the Berber population. The paper also argues that the use of discourse by the salafi nationalists was very effective because most Moroccans were not yet at a point where they could be said to have internalized any sort of Moroccan national identity.",

The thesis explores sociolinguistic issues in Morocco, focusing on language attitudes and use among students at Mohammed V University in Rabat. It addresses the linguistic history of Morocco, including language coexistence, struggles for linguistic dominance, shifts in language policy in education, language endangerment and revitalization, and the use of language to define national identity. The thesis examines the history of the Amazigh movement and the recognition of Tamazight as an official language in the 2011 constitution. It analyzes students' perceptions of various languages, including Spanish, English, Moroccan Arabic, Modern Standard Arabic, French, and Tamazight, considering factors such as gender, region, social class, and major. The research aims to illustrate current patterns of thought about language, assess the efficacy of the Amazigh movement, and predict the future linguistic landscape of Morocco. It also identifies a new language ideology influenced by universal human rights values.",

The excerpt mentions the encouragement of indigenous elites from Vietnam to Morocco to study in colonial or metropolitan universities, which supplied cadres and journalistic voices for anti-colonial nationalism, and refers to the Islamic revivalist movement Nahda in late 19th-century Algeria, seeking to protect Muslim culture against French colonization. Although the text mainly focuses on Algeria and Tunisia, the mention of Morocco within the context of French colonial policies and indigenous elites receiving education in colonial systems establishes a connection to the broader topic of resistance to French influence in the region, which can include resistance to the Berber Dahir.",

The chapter examines the state's efforts to create, restructure, or reform government institutions with linguistic missions and their effectiveness.

By analyzing specific examples of invented traditions, such as cultural practices, historical narratives, symbols, and festivals, the study uncovers the ways in which these traditions were utilized to shape policy implementation and rally public support. The article highlights the construction and production of heritage in the context of Moroccan nationalism and how invented traditions played an important role in shaping national narrative and identity.",

It discusses the historical context of tension between the Rif region and the central Moroccan authority, tracing it back to the resistance against Spanish colonial power and highlighting the region's economic and political marginalization since Morocco's independence in 1956. The text examines the interregional economic inequalities, the unfinished reconciliation between the Rif and the monarchy despite Mohammed VI's efforts, and the strengthening of a politicized regional identity through Amazigh associations. The document details the socioeconomic demands of the Hirak movement, including the derogation of the 1958 dahir establishing Al Hoceima as a military zone, an end to economic blockade and corruption, improved employment, and better infrastructure. It also discusses the government's response to the protests, including economic contributions and dismissals of officials, as well as the repression of the movement and arrests of its leaders. The analysis concludes that the protests revealed deficiencies in the state's capacity to govern the territory and weaknesses in existing governance mechanisms, while highlighting a crisis of political representation.",

It examines the historical background of the current linguistic situation, tracing its evolution over fourteen centuries, and discusses factors relevant to the language policy debate in Morocco. The text highlights the Arab conquest and Arabization process, noting the role of the Berber dynasties (Almoravids, Almohads, and Marinides) despite the spread of Arabic after the 7th century. The influence of French colonial rule after 1912 is discussed, emphasizing the introduction of a new education system and policies aimed at dividing Arabs and Berbers, culminating in the Berber Decree (Dahir of 1930). The Berber Decree directly aimed to set up different judicial systems for Arabs and Berbers but was seen as an attempt to divide the country, sparking protests from both groups. After Morocco's independence in 1956, the dominance of French persisted, leading to calls for Arabization and debates about national identity. The text further explores the postcolonial period, highlighting the complexities of language politics, the different perspectives of religious conservatives, Arab nationalists, and Berber leaders, and the continuing role of French in education and administration. Finally, the text touches upon the recent increase in Berber media and cultural recognition and the Berber diaspora's role in advocating for Berber language rights.",

The dissertation examines the agency of young Moroccans from underprivileged neighborhoods in Casablanca, Morocco, within the context of colonial legacies, demographic realities, and neoliberal policies. It uses 30 semi-structured interviews to explore how these young individuals navigate their lives within their families, education, and work. The author argues that young people are not passive victims but actively employ strategies and tactics to negotiate their daily lives under bounded conditions. The dissertation also touches upon the historical demonstrations of individual and collective agency by young people in Morocco, shaping Moroccan modern history. Although it does not focus primarily on the Berber Dahir resistance, it contextualizes youth agency within a history shaped by colonial legacies, an important element in the broader history and understanding of the resistance movement against the Berber Dahir.",

It argues that Islamism is not a recent phenomenon, but has been a driving force in the emergence of national consciousness during the colonial era, and continues to play a significant role in the region's political opposition and secularization processes. The text analyzes the relationship between Islamism and nationalism in the Maghreb countries (Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia), noting the different contexts and circumstances that shaped their respective nationalist discourses and struggles. Specifically regarding Morocco, the document mentions the Berber Dahir of 1930 and its impact on radicalizing Moroccan nationalism, as it was perceived as an attempt to undermine Islam and de-Islamize the Berber population, which in turn fueled resistance and solidified the role of Islam in the national identity. The document also delves into the ideological conflicts between the state and religious movements regarding legal authority, particularly in family law, and the broader challenges of secularization and democratization in Muslim societies. It frames Islamism as both a reaction to modernization and a force for change, albeit a contradictory one, shaped by the region's historical experiences and its relationship with the West.",

It touches upon the historical context of language in Morocco, mentioning the Berber Dahir and its impact on national identity. The paper explores the shift from a monolingual Arabization policy to a multilingual approach and the role of English language in the Moroccan educational system. It examines the common assumption that English language endangers Moroccan local culture and challenges the culturalist worries about the jeopardy represented by the international language on local cultures and identities. The research involves questionnaires and open conversations with teachers, students, and Peace Corps volunteers to determine their attitudes towards multilingual education and the place of English in Moroccan schools. It also discusses the challenges of teaching English in isolation from its related culture and suggests the adoption of intercultural education and critical pedagogy to enhance the situation of English Language Teaching (ELT) in Morocco.",

It discusses the French Protectorate's policy towards the Berber population, aiming to preserve their customary laws (Orf/Izref) and limit the influence of Islamic law (Chrâa). The document explains the creation of the \"Comité d’Etudes Berbères\" in 1915 to study and administer the Berber tribes. The Dahir Berbère, intended to adapt Berber justice to modern times, was perceived by Moroccan nationalists as an attack on Islam and an attempt to divide the country, sparking widespread protests, including the recitation of the \"Latifs\" in mosques. The document also covers the reactions of French authorities, the campaign against the Dahir in France and the Middle East led by figures like Chakib Arslan, and the eventual abrogation of Article 6 of the Dahir by the Dahir of April 8, 1934. The article concludes that despite this abrogation, the French Berber policy continued, while the Dahir Berbère contributed to the unification of the Moroccan nationalist movement.",

The author argues that this dahir and the associated \"Berber policy\" have been systematically condemned, while \"Arab policy\" and \"Muslim policy\" were considered legitimate. The article examines the historical context, the role of Lyautey in establishing alliances with Berber caïds, and the emergence of Moroccan nationalism in response to the Dahir Berbère. It also analyzes the structure of the indigenous judicial system under the French Protectorate, highlighting the distinctions between religious and civil statutes, and the different types of justice systems that were in place (chraâ, rabbinic, caïdal, and jmaâs judiciaire). The author questions the motivations behind the Dahir Berbère and its impact on the evolution of Moroccan institutions, suggesting that it contributed to the birth of the nationalist movement and compromised pre-colonial Moroccan institutions.

The review highlights how the Moroccan nationalist movement was influenced by the ideals of the Enlightenment and the French Revolution. It notes the significance of the 1930 Berber Dahir and the 1934 creation of the League of Human Rights in Tetouan as crucial events that spurred organized resistance and demands for political and social reforms. The text explores the complex relationship between the nationalist movement and French human rights organizations, noting the latter's initial reluctance to support Moroccan protests against policies perceived as promoting Christianization and against the deportation of Abd-el Krim. The review also details the post-independence period, the rise of political repression under Hassan II, and the emergence of human rights organizations in response to state violence, as well as their limitations. It then touches upon the gradual improvement in human rights conditions in the 1990s and the challenges faced by human rights movements in Moroccan society.",

It discusses the various attitudes of the ulema towards the colonial powers, ranging from collaboration to resistance. The document highlights the role of figures such as Muḥammad al-Makkī al-Nāṣirī and ‘Abd al-‘azīz al-Ṯa‘ālbī, who employed legal arguments based on international law to challenge the legitimacy and legality of the protectorates. The paper specifically mentions the Berber Dahir of 1930 as a point of contention and emphasizes the ulema's critique of the protectorate's infringement upon the sovereignty of the Sultan and Bey. It also discusses the limited role the ulema played in the legislative processes under the protectorate. The document suggests that the ulema's critique was a manifestation of a broader nationalist movement and was based on legal principles and the perceived hypocrisy of the colonial administration.

          "source_summary": "This article discusses the construction and manipulation of the concept of \"autochtony\" (indigenous identity) in Morocco, particularly in relation to Berber populations, from the colonial period to the present day. It explores how the French Protectorate used the idea of Berber autochthony to further its own political goals, creating administrative units based on tribal affiliation and recognizing specific ethnic and judicial distinctions. The article argues that this policy, exemplified by the \"Berber Dahir\" of 1930, aimed to integrate Berber-speaking populations into the colonial project. The source highlights the irony of the Berber Dahir which was opposed by the urban elites and eventually fueled Moroccan nationalism. It further discusses how post-colonial Moroccan governments and Amazigh activists have also engaged with the notion of autochtony, often in ways that diverge from the values and practices of Berber societies themselves. The article provides a historical overview of the changing relationship between Berber identity, land, and political power in Morocco, and questions the relevance and meaning of 'autochtony' in Berber society.",

            "The Protectorate viewed collective land as an opportunity to implement a dual land policy: exploiting ambiguous land status from the pre-colonial era to secure land reserves for territorial colonization, and maintaining tribal cohesion to prevent massive exodus to cities and control pastoral mobility within tribal territory."

It highlights the diverse agency of women challenging Moroccan traditions regarding individual rights and freedoms. The text argues these events mark a longer struggle for rights within a patriarchal structure, demonstrating indigenous Moroccan emancipation preceding Western citizenship concepts. It also mentions the case of Lalla al-Batoul and argues that these cases represent expressions of freedom and rights, providing evidence against radical Islamic claims that Islamic culture is inherently incompatible with Western concepts of rights-based citizenship. It criticizes radical Islamic ideology for minimizing the historical significance of women's agency in opposing oppression within a misogynistic culture.

The document details specific instances of discrimination, including the suppression of Berber language and cultural expression, restrictions on associations, and the marginalization of Berber artists. It critically analyzes the introduction of Berber into the education system and the establishment of the Royal Institute for Amazigh Culture (IRCAM), suggesting that these measures are insufficient and may even be counterproductive.

The analysis emphasizes the French perspective, highlighting their concerns about potential destabilization in their mandated territories (Syria and Lebanon) due to the Palestinian issue, Zionist ambitions, and British influence. The text directly connects the events in Palestine, including the actions of the Grand Mufti, to French policy in the Levant and its fears concerning repercussions in North Africa, specifically referencing the impact of the Dahir Berbère of 1930 (l'affaire du Dahir berbère de 1930) and the potential for French-Christianization of Berbers, a key claim of the Moroccan resistance movement. The document outlines France's attempts to manage the situation by engaging with the Grand Mufti, balancing British demands for surveillance, and countering pan-Arab sentiments, while simultaneously protecting its interests in the Levant and North Africa. It details French concerns about the British, including the fear that London was trying to expand British control into French territories or push Palestinians into Syria and Lebanon, and notes France's attempts to use the Mufti as leverage in Syrian politics.

It touches on the 'Berber Dahir' of May 16, 1930, a decree by the French Protectorate that recognized the specificity of Berber customary law, and the subsequent nationalist reactions accusing France of attempting to divide the country. The document explains how this Dahir was perceived by Arab nationalists as a means to undermine Islamic law and potentially assimilate Berbers into French culture. It discusses the political and cultural context surrounding the Berber language, its standardization efforts, and its gradual recognition in education and media under King Mohammed VI, highlighting the ongoing tensions between Arabization policies and Berber cultural rights. The text also addresses the role of Berber associations and their efforts to promote Berber language and culture and discusses the royal initiative to integrate Amazigh language into the educational system starting in September 2003. It also touches on the 1996 law imposing Arabic names, viewed as discriminatory towards Berbers. The overall linguistic landscape in Morocco, particularly the interplay between Arabic, French, and Berber, and the historical and political factors shaping it, are discussed.

It argues that the French protectorate's distinction between customary and positive law obscured the extent to which positive law reshaped customary practices, particularly concerning women's access to land. The article explores the mobilization of *soulaliyates* (women belonging to ethnic collectives) and the reforms implemented to align the collective land system with gender equality norms. It analyzes how different actors have used customary law both as a source of exclusion and as a basis for legitimizing equality claims. It also touches upon how the Berber Dahir of 1930 created a different legal framework for Berber tribes.

            "The article argues that the distinction between customary and positive law was used to extend the control of the central power over collectively exploited territories, placing them under the authority of the colonial authorities, and subsequently, under the Ministry of the Interior after independence.",

          "source_summary": "This text analyzes the historical trajectory of governance in Morocco, focusing on the interplay between the French Protectorate and the Cherifian Empire. It argues that the Protectorate, while ostensibly preserving Moroccan traditions, significantly reshaped the political landscape, leading to a dual system of power characterized by a bureaucratic colonial state alongside a modernized and re-traditionalized Makhzen. This dualism continued after independence, with Moroccan leaders adopting aspects of both the colonial state and traditional structures. The article examines how the Protectorate's policies, including the emphasis on tradition, the strengthening of the Sultan's authority, and the introduction of bureaucratic practices, have had a lasting impact on Moroccan governance. It also explores the tension between modernity and tradition in Moroccan politics, highlighting how the concept of reform has been used to legitimize both change and the preservation of existing power structures. The study points to a concentration of power, initially under the Protectorate and perpetuated after independence, contributing to the fusion of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches, affecting governance dynamics in Morocco.",
          "extracted_key_facts": [

            "The Protectorate implemented a dual system, preserving the Cherifian Empire while establishing a French colonial administration.",
            "The system of protections, formalized by the 1856 treaty with England, created distinct categories of the Moroccan population with different rights and obligations, paving the way for foreign penetration.",
            "Lyautey aimed to preserve the Makhzen from colonial penetration, maintaining its traditional organization and functioning to leverage its legitimacy for the Protectorate.",
            "The 'campagne d’assainissement' in 1995-1996 was characterized by some Moroccan actors using the concept of 'harka'.",
            "The Protectorate undertook a process of 'purification,' modernization, and strengthening of the Sultan and the Makhzen.",
            "Lyautey separated European and Moroccan neighborhoods, created separate schools for Muslims/Berbers and the French, and maintained Muslim juridictions for Moroccans and French juridictions for the colons.",

            "The Office Chérifien des Phosphates (OCP) was created by dahir in 1920, reserving phosphate exploration exclusively to the Makhzen.",

            "The Berber Dahir, a significant legal shift, was driven by pro-Berber sentiment and was perceived as such by the Makhzen.",

Specifically, it mentions the role of Berber elites in advocating for cultural and political rights, as well as the Berber Spring of 1980 in Algeria and the Berber Manifesto of 2000 in Morocco. These details are relevant to the broader historical context of Berber cultural and linguistic identity and resistance within Morocco, connecting to the themes associated with \"مقاومة الظهير البربري (المغرب)\", even if the focus is not directly on the 1930 Dahir itself.",

Jansen, published in Vingtième Siècle. Revue d'histoire, 2014/1 N° 121. While primarily focusing on Algeria, the article directly mentions the 'dahir berbère' (Berber Decree) of May 16, 1930, in Morocco, describing it as a catalyst for Moroccan nationalism. The article examines colonial celebrations and resistance in Algeria during the 1930s, comparing and contrasting the commemorations with the responses of the Algerian population, ranging from the elite to the masses. It explores strategies of intervention used by the colonized, including participation, rumors, subversive appropriation, and boycott. The article discusses the 'centenairomanie' and the Constantine festivities of 1937. Ultimately, the article provides a complex view of the evolving attitudes of Algerians towards colonial rule, while acknowledging the influence of the Berber Decree.",

The agreement established Spanish zone of influence was defined, encompassing areas from the Moulouya River to the Loukkos River in the north, and from the Draa River to Rio de Oro in the south, excluding Tangier.

The introduction also makes mention of Berber resistance against the Roman Empire, thereby establishing a historical context of resistance in North Africa relevant to the general topic. The book explores the dialectic between state power and various forms of resistance, including the Hirak du Rif which is part of the broader scope of Amazigh social resistance (as in the Berber Dahir resistance movement). It provides context on post-colonial state building in Morocco, and the place of Amazigh identity in this process. The introduction frames the book as a study on how state power and resistance have co-shaped each other throughout modern history.",

Le cas du Maroc dans une approche de droit comparé\" by Samira Idllalène, published in Développement durable et territoires in April 2013. The article explores the potential of the Habous (Waqf), a traditional Islamic institution, as a tool for biodiversity conservation in Morocco. It examines the ethical and political foundations of Habous, its historical applications in protecting natural resources, and its similarities with Anglo-American trusts. The author argues that Habous, with its inherent characteristics of inalienability, perpetual existence, and community involvement, can offer a culturally and politically anchored, flexible approach to biodiversity management, potentially complementing and enhancing the effectiveness of modern legal instruments. The article also mentions the Dahir Berbère of 1930, which is relevant to understanding the historical context of customary law in Morocco and its impact on the reception of modern environmental law, creating resistance due to the imposition of \"external\" laws by the French protectorate.",

It touches upon the opposition from the Résidence Générale to a project in 1932, creating three vicariats in French Morocco, relating this opposition to the Dahir Berbère and its caused troubles. It also discusses the limitations on proselytism imposed by Marshal Lyautey and the French Protectorate in Morocco, emphasizing the commitment to safeguard the religious situation and prestige of the Sultan and Islamic institutions. Therefore, it provides relevant context for understanding the French colonial administration's religious policies during the protectorate period, a time when the Berber Dahir occurred.",

It details aspects of agriculture, land ownership, animal husbandry, transhumance customs, commerce, small industries, and usury prevalent amongst the Berber tribes of that area. The text highlights administrative interventions by the French authorities to organize transhumance, protect forests, and improve livestock raising, describing the classification of tribes based on their familiarity with French methods and the impact of French policy on Berber economic life. The document provides statistical data on crop production and livestock numbers and discusses the challenges of usury and land appropriation faced by the Berbers. It touches on the role of the French authorities in attempting to address issues of justice and equity while respecting local customs. The emphasis is on the economic and administrative transformations occurring during a period contemporaneous with, and influenced by, Berber resistance and French administration.

It examines the movement's transition from cultural advocacy to political demands, including the official recognition of the Amazigh language and culture. The article outlines the key events, associations, and figures involved in the struggle for Amazigh rights, focusing on the creation of the Institut Royal de la Culture Amazighe (IRCAM) in 2001, the debates surrounding the choice of the Tifinagh alphabet, and the eventual constitutionalization of Amazigh in 2011. The article further discusses the internal tensions and debates within the Amazigh movement, particularly regarding the use of the term 'Berber' versus 'Amazigh', the concept of 'autochtony', and the extent of political involvement. It concludes by analyzing the differing reactions of Amazigh activists to the 2011 constitutional reforms and the challenges that remain in fully integrating the Amazigh language and culture into Moroccan society.",

            "Amazigh intellectuals adopted the term \"Amazigh\" and rejected \"Berbère\" as pejorative, though 'berbère' was more commonly used in the movement's early years during the 1960s and 1970s.",
            "In 1967, the Association Marocaine pour la Recherche et les Echanges Culturels (AMREC) was created in Rabat to promote culture and arts, strategically avoiding the term \"Berbère\".",

            "King Hassan II, in his August 20, 1994, speech, praised the \"dialectes berbères\" and announced the introduction of Amazigh in primary schools; however, this resulted only in a short TV news segment in the three Amazigh dialects.",
            "In 1995, the Congrès Mondial Amazigh was created as an international non-governmental organization promoting Amazigh linguistic and cultural rights.",
            "In March 2000, the \"Manifeste berbère\" was signed, emphasizing the need for official recognition of Amazighité in Morocco and sparking debates regarding the MCA's politization.",

            "On September 15, 2003, the Ministry of National Education launched an \"experimental\" teaching program of Amazigh in 317 schools, with generalization planned for 2008.",

The text discusses the impact of General Lyautey's policies during the French Protectorate in Morocco, which lasted for 44 years following the Treaty of March 30, 1912, and beyond the country's independence in 1956. It highlights the contradictions in Lyautey's approach, referencing his earlier involvement in annexing Moroccan territories to Algeria while later advocating for the conservation of the Cherifian empire. The text further touches on the resistance encountered during the establishment of the Protectorate, including tribal resistance following the imposition of the Protectorate on Sultan 'Abd al-Hafîd (1907-1912) and the events in Fes (April 1912). It notes that the resistance prompted Lyautey to modify his strategy, emphasizing the importance of the Makhzen.",

It covers various aspects of resistance to colonial rule in Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia, focusing on the rise of nationalism after World War I. The text examines the Berber \"dissidence\" in Morocco, the Rif War led by Abd el-Krim, the emergence of political parties and leaders such as Allal al-Fasi, and the impact of the Berber Dahir of 1930. It also details the constitutional debates in Tunisia and the early proletarian movements. The source emphasizes the growing opposition to colonial rule and the attempts by colonial authorities to manage or suppress it, noting the socio-economic factors contributing to nationalist sentiment. The text further explores the complex relationships between different political factions, including nationalists, communists, and reformists, and the influence of Islamic reform movements. It analyzes the challenges faced by the colonial powers and the evolving dynamics of resistance in the Maghreb during this period, highlighting the tension and the growing demand for reforms and eventual independence.",
          "extracted_key_facts": [
            "The Berber \"dissidence\" (sība) in Morocco continued the pre-colonial resistance against the French, with the French presence in the Middle Atlas facing more resistance than previous rulers.",

            "The Rif region, under the leadership of Abd el-Krim, never disarmed and inflicted a significant defeat on the Spanish at Anoual in July 1921.",
            "Abd el-Krim established the \"Rif Republic\" on February 18, 1923, attempting to reform traditional societal structures by using elements from Islamic law, like abolishing collective oaths and reforming guard towers.",
            "The Berber Dahir of May 16, 1930, which incorporated Berber customary law into the colonial judicial system, was perceived as an attack on Islam and an attempt to divide the country and triggered mass protests.",
            "The Dahir sparked over 120 incidents from June 20 to September 30, 1930, often centered in mosques where the laṭīf prayer was recited.",
            "Authorities responded to the protests against the Berber Dahir with arrests and imprisonment including Allal al-Fasi and Bel Hasan al-Wazani who were arrested on August 31.",
            "The Comité d’action marocaine, where Allal al-Fasi started to dominate, deposited on December 1, 1934 a Plan of Reforms to give back the protectorate its real sense and goal.",
            "Abd el-Krim had connections with the PCF (Parti communiste français), which organized a support strike for him on October 10, 1925, during which French workers protested against the colonial war in Morocco.",
            "Abd el-Krim surrendered to French authorities on May 26, 1926 after the French employed disproportionate means to defeat him."

It centers on the social and political control of the city between 1944 and 1953. The text analyses how bidonvilles were viewed as a grave political threat and covers the colonial state’s repressive practices. In reaction to the assassination of Tunisian trade unionist Ferhat Hached, the UGSCM and the Istiqlal party called for a general strike, leading to protests in the Carrières centrales bidonville and other neighborhoods, highlighting the repressive actions undertaken by colonial authorities.",

It discusses the historical background of the introduction of Amazigh into the Moroccan education system, the various royal decrees and charters that influenced its status, and the implementation of Amazigh language education in primary schools. The article also explores the challenges and resistances faced by the Amazigh language, including the influence of Arab nationalism and the limited implementation of policies. It references the Dahir of 1930 and the Arab Nationalist movement's influence on language policies, while also highlighting the activism and advocacy efforts to promote the Amazigh language and culture. The article critiques the perceived inequalities in the treatment of Amazigh compared to Arabic and French, and the representations and practices that hinder the effective teaching and learning of Amazigh. It notes the arrest of Amazigh activists in 1994 for promoting the language and calls for a more sincere policy in favor of Amazigh.",

The bourgeoisie attempted to use the bureaucracy to modernize the country, mirroring some aspects of the protectorate's liberal policies.

The thesis explores the CLCRM's origins, objectives, and operations within the broader context of Moroccan political history, political exile, and international solidarity movements. It examines the evolution of Moroccan political parties, the rise of Hassan II's regime, the development of the security apparatus, and the phenomenon of political exile, all of which contributed to the creation and work of the CLCRM. The thesis also details the methodology used to investigate the CLCRM's history and its interactions with other organizations in Europe. It acknowledges the courage and solidarity of individuals and organizations involved in the fight against repression in Morocco, highlighting the roles of women and the challenges faced by Moroccan activists in the face of political oppression. The study explores the relationship between Moroccan politics and the European solidarity movement while distinguishing the activities of the CLCRM in Belgium from those in other parts of Europe. Key events like the 1981 Casablanca uprising, the UNEM congresses, and the involvement of various political figures and organizations from Morocco, Belgium, and France are discussed in the context of the CLCRM's efforts.",

The article examines how the National Initiative for Human Development (INDH), launched in 2005, promotes income-generating activities (AGR) and how this relates to the integration, normalisation, and potential dispossession of Berber populations in the El Hajeb province. It discusses how such initiatives can co-opt or redirect Berber activism through economic incentives and procedural requirements. It shows the historical organization of the Beni M'tir tribe before the Protectorate and mentions the French influence during the Protectorate. The focus on El Hajeb, a region with a significant Berber population and its historical context, makes it indirectly related to understanding the complexities of state-Berber relations that were at the heart of the Berber Dahir resistance.",

It analyzes the legal and normative frameworks used to legitimize the inclusion of women in the lists of beneficiaries of these lands, particularly focusing on ministerial circulars issued between 2009 and 2012 by the Ministry of the Interior. The article examines how these circulars, prompted by protests and influenced by evolving national and international contexts, shifted from relying on customary law to incorporating principles of Islamic law and constitutional equality. It explores the case of the Mehdawa community to demonstrate how local delegates adapted and justified the implementation of these directives. The content is directly relevant to understanding the complexities of land rights and social justice during the period of resistance to the Berber Dahir.",

            "The ministerial circulars of 2009-2012 emerged after mobilizations of women demanding land rights, particularly in the Gharb region.",
            "The first circular, issued in July 2009, was addressed to the wali of the Gharb-Chrarda-Beni Hssen region, designating the Province of Kénitra as a pilot province.",
            "Subsequent circulars issued in October 2010 and March 2012 extended the directive to all provinces without regional restriction.",

The first book, 'Making Morocco: Colonial Intervention and the Politics of Identity' by Jonathan Wyrtzen, focuses on the French protectorate and the dynamics of power, strategies of legitimation, and the colonial administration. It analyzes the resistance to colonial penetration by rural populations, especially in the Atlas Mountains and the Rif, highlighting Abd el-Krim's leadership in the Rif. It also explores the emergence of urban resistance and the definition of a national identity based on Arab-Islamic elements, which marginalized Berber and Jewish identities, and the role of the Dahir Berbere as a catalyst for nationalist movement. It further discusses the negotiation of the Jewish question and the role of women in the identity conflicts during the colonial period. The second book, 'Spanish Education in Morocco: 1912-1956' by Irene González González, examines the role of education as a tool for colonial penetration in the Spanish zone. It details the educational policies, the types of schools created (Hispano-Arabic, Hispano-Jewish, and Spanish schools), the rise of nationalist education, the intervention in Muslim education, and the marroquinization of education during the Franco regime. The review highlights the importance of revisiting the colonial past with a critical perspective.",

While not exclusively focused on the Berber Dahir resistance, it analyzes social movements and resistance throughout Moroccan history, including the colonial period, offering insights and a framework applicable to understanding the context and dynamics of the Berber Dahir protests. It considers various factors such as the role of nationalism, colonialism, economic grievances, the use of religious rhetoric, the impact of media, and the evolving nature of protests and state responses. It discusses naming conventions used by social actors involved in mobilizations, as well as analysts and researchers. It looks at cycles of protest and phases of resistance, and how the role of Islam is important in protest. It talks about resistance against the advances of state and capital. The article also discusses the impact of colonial borders on political organization. It goes into spaces of protest and how various actors use those spaces.

The Dahir Berbere is explicitly mentioned as a catalyst for nationalist movements.\n\nGonzález González's book analyzes the role of Spanish education in the Spanish zone of Morocco as a tool for colonial penetration, highlighting the different types of schools (Hispano-Arabic, Hispano-Jewish, and Spanish schools) and the evolution of educational policies, as well as the rise of nationalist responses in the 1920s and the subsequent attempts to control Islamic education.

It argues that the Republic initially raised expectations among Moroccan nationalists but ultimately failed to address their grievances. The document details the various political and social controls imposed by the Republic, including restrictions on movement, suppression of nationalist activities, and the favoring of Spanish settlers. It also explores the failed attempts to forge an alliance between Moroccan nationalists and the Republican government during the Spanish Civil War, contrasting this with the eventual pact between the nationalists and Franco's forces, which led to the granting of certain freedoms in the Spanish Protectorate under Franco's control.

Benumeya, an exceptional figure in Spanish Africanism, sought to connect Hispanidad and Arabidad, linking Spain, Latin America, and the Arab world. From 1920 onwards, he used the relationship between Spain and its former American colonies, along with the situation of Arab migrants in America, as a model to analyze Spain's administration of the Moroccan Protectorate and to envision a future relationship after Morocco's potential independence. This suggests a direct connection to the political and colonial context in which the Berber Dahir resistance occurred.",

          "source_summary": "This article examines the views of Rodolfo Gil Benumeya, a Spanish intellectual and political figure, on the Spanish Protectorate in Morocco, particularly in relation to the Berber Dahir and the rise of Moroccan nationalism. Benumeya sought to connect Spain, Latin America, and the Arab world, drawing parallels between Spain's relationship with its former American colonies and its administration of the Moroccan Protectorate. He advocated for a Hispano-Arab alliance, emphasizing the role of Arab emigrants in America as facilitators of political, cultural, and economic cooperation. Benumeya saw the Spanish Protectorate as a point of convergence for Spanish ambitions and Arab expectations, including those of Arab emigrants in America. He analyzed the Berber Dahir and its impact on Moroccan identity, suggesting ways to manage Moroccan nationalism based on the American post-colonial experience. He believed the Moroccan elite, like the Creole elite in the Americas, should be supported. He warned that relying solely on the Hispano-Muslim minority in Morocco could lead to problems similar to those experienced with the Creoles in the Americas. Benumeya also noted the potential of Arab emigrants in the New World to aid in Spain's development, highlighting their economic and cultural influence. Ultimately, the article explores Benumeya's vision of Spain acting as a bridge between the Arab world and Latin America, with Morocco serving as a key link. The article highlights his proposed actions and recommendations regarding the Protectorate's management, the Dahir Bereber issue, and the cultivation of a Spanish-influenced Moroccan nationalism, drawing parallels with Spanish America. Despite these efforts, his ideas saw little governmental support during the Republic but gained traction later during Franco's regime.",

It traces the development of Moroccan literature through three phases: the conceptualization of 'Moroccan Arabic literature' until the mid-20th century, the establishment of genres for 'modern Moroccan literature' in the post-colonial era, and the subsequent canonization of individual genres and authors.

It details the introduction of European-style property laws alongside existing Moroccan systems and efforts to promote agricultural colonization by Spanish settlers. The document highlights the tensions arising from these policies, including resistance from the Moroccan population, and the difficulties in privatizing communal lands due to legal complexities and social opposition. It further examines the establishment of various administrative bodies, such as Juntas Rurales, aimed at managing rural affairs and generating revenue, ultimately finding that these efforts largely failed to improve the economic conditions of the Moroccan rural population by the time of Moroccan independence in 1956.

It begins by defining the Makhzen as a unique state formation in Morocco, highlighting its historical functions and transformations, particularly under Mohammed V, who abolished the title of Sultan but retained religious leadership and the concept of 'beya'a'. The article explores the complexities of the Moroccan left's development, influenced by figures like Abdelkrim al-Khatabi and later, Mehdi Ben Barka, and its interactions with colonial powers and the nationalist Istiqlal party. It then delves into the challenges faced by the left, including its relationship with the Berber population, particularly in the Rif region, exemplified by the 1958 Rif uprising and the French-backed 'Berber Dahir' of 1930. Finally, it touches upon the concept of 'incomplétude' and the colonial period's role in shaping national borders, linking this to the left's nationalist aspirations. The article ultimately argues that the Makhzen has historically co-opted and assimilated the Moroccan left through a mix of repression, clientelism, and appeals to national unity, while recognizing the existence of a critical, independent left represented by figures like Abraham Serfaty.",

Cornell's \"The Realm of the Saint: Power and Authority in Moroccan Sufism\" (1998), and Maya Shatzmiller's \"The Berbers and the Islamic State: The Marinid Experience in Pre-Protectorate Morocco\" (2000). The review analyzes each book's arguments, sources, and methodologies, highlighting their differing perspectives on the construction of Islamic society in the Maghreb and the role of Berbers within it. Cornell's book focuses on Sufi saints and their authority, challenging colonial historiography and emphasizing the integration of Sufism within Islamic law. Shatzmiller's book examines the Marinid dynasty and Berber participation in state formation, emphasizing Berber resistance to cultural assimilation. The review discusses the debate over the level of islamization amongst Berber populations and the potential persistence of pre-Islamic traditions. The review contrasts Cornell's perspective, which views Moroccan Sufism as an orthodox and universalist Sunni manifestation, with Shatzmiller's focus on Berber resistance to Arab-Islamic cultural uniformity, relating it to colonial historical narratives and contemporary Moroccan historiography. The discussion of the review includes the Berber Dahir of 1930 and its historical and cultural implications and context. The review provides insights into power dynamics, cultural identity, and the complex interplay of religion and politics in Moroccan history, with specific reference to the Berber question.",

It examines the concept of political segmentarity, the role of the Makhzen (the central Moroccan power structure), and the interactions between the sultans, the tribes, and the European powers, particularly France and Germany. The study analyzes how these sultans navigated the complex political landscape of Morocco during the establishment of the French Protectorate, including the intrigues, rebellions, and external pressures that shaped their reigns. The article also touches on the involvement of key figures like Lyautey, Raisuni, and Ben Ghabrit in influencing the political dynamics of the time. It explores the concept of the 'siba,' or tribal insubordination, as well as how the French utilized ethnography to better exert control during the protectorate, including their reliance on the 'divide and conquer' strategy. The article also analyzes the exiles of Abdelaziz and Hafid and the constant French monitoring of them. Finally, the article concludes by observing the importance of the segmentary system in the events related to the rise and fall of the three sultans, as well as Lyautey's utilization of the sultans and vice versa.",

It specifically examines how Spain, under General García Valiño, exploited French difficulties to bolster its own position, often supporting Moroccan nationalists against French rule. The text details the shift in Spanish colonial policy, influenced by the Cold War and Franco's desire to distance himself from France. It discusses the Pacto Nacional between Moroccan nationalist parties, Spanish involvement with the Ejército de Liberación Marroquí (ELM), and the eventual independence of Morocco. The analysis concludes that Spain's actions during this period, while seemingly beneficial in the short term, ultimately damaged Franco-Spanish relations and hindered the establishment of positive future relations with Morocco. The text also mentions the abolishment of the Treaty of Fez and the tense negotiations between Muhammad V and Franco which led to the signing of the joint Spanish-Moroccan declaration on April 7, 1956, which officially recognized the independence of Morocco.",

It examines the sociopolitical conflicts related to language, focusing on the relationship between the state (monarchy) and the Amazigh cultural movement. The study analyzes three types of discourses: the monarchical discourse of Hassan II (1961-1999), the current monarchical discourse, and the alternative Amazigh discourse. The theoretical and methodological framework is based on critical descriptive sociolinguistics, language policy, and critical discourse analysis, with a historical-discursive approach. It explores how the state manages linguistic diversity and the resistance to these policies, particularly by the Amazigh movement, relating it to inequality and social injustice. The source also discusses antecedents in sociolinguistic studies of Morocco and formulates a hypothesis around the impact of Arabization and the emergence of the Amazigh alternative discourse. It details the theoretical framework including critical sociolinguistics, language policy as discourse, and critical discourse analysis with a historical approach and triangulation methodology. The document includes a brief socio-historical context of Morocco, discussing the dominance of Arabic and the subsequent marginalization of Amazigh language and culture, and the influence of French and Spanish colonization. It also discusses the phases of analysis, including the model of Hassan II's era (1961-1999) with its focus on Arabization and the consequences of this model, and the new model under Mohamed VI (1999-2006) with its recognition of linguistic diversity. The summary also includes an analysis of the representation strategies of linguistic diversity in monarchical discourses and the discussion of the cultural Amazigh movement and its model of language policy.",

It argues that the confrontation between nomadic and capitalist-colonial territorialities has intensified with the increased U.S. presence, driven by strategic resources and perceived threats to hegemony. The thesis analyzes the long 20th century to understand the cycles of accumulation and territorialization of hegemony in the region, highlighting the British cycle as the point of amalgation between state and capital. It discusses the colonial period and the subsequent independent states, as well as the neoliberal policies and counterterrorism efforts. The study also aims to contribute to the study of hegemony in Africa from critical Latin American, decolonial, and Marxist perspectives, focusing on the production of omitted territorialities and the projection of alternatives. The study incorporates historical context and mentions various forms of resistance to hegemonic forces, including the role of the Amazigh population.",
