While the primary focus is on the naval aspects of the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939), the article mentions the Battle of Annual (Anoual) as a historical precursor that weakened the Spanish military before the civil war. The article discusses Spain's efforts to rebuild its naval forces after the disastrous defeat against the United States in 1898, the internal divisions within the Spanish Navy that led to its split during the Civil War, and the international involvement in the conflict. The author discusses how, after the loss of its colonies in the Americas and Asia after 1898, Spain avoided involvement in World War I, but experienced internal fractures. The War of the Rif (1921-1926) and the defeat at Anoual served as a warning. The Spanish Navy provided logistical support and artillery during the War of the Rif, but lost the battleship España in 1923. The article covers the naval strategies of both Republican and Nationalist factions, as well as the interventions of other countries like Great Britain, France, Italy, and Germany. It further argues that naval factors played a critical role in the civil war, impacting strategies, supply chains, and international relations. Finally, it draws parallels between the international involvement in the Spanish Civil War and more recent conflicts in Syria and Libya.",

The article discusses the lead-up to the second phase of the Rif War, focusing on the Franco-Rifian conflict and the period starting from 1921. It highlights the escalating tensions between the French and Rifian forces, especially after the French advance in May 1924. The core issue was the control of the Beni Zeroual tribe, which both the French and Rifian leaders considered strategically and economically important. The Rifian perspective, according to Azerkane's memoirs, was that their intervention in the Beni Zeroual tribe was necessary due to the actions of the French-aligned Sharîf Derqawi, who was repressing Rifian sympathizers and inciting tribes against them. Abdelkrim's envoy, Haddou Ben Hammou, communicated to Gabrielli that the Rifians would not accept further French advancement into the Beni Zeroual territory until border issues were resolved.",

It also details the production and use of chemical weapons (phosgene, chloropicrine, and yperite) by Spain against the Rif rebels between 1921 and 1927.

The article emphasizes the tactical and strategic adaptations made by the French, including the theories developed by Colonel Paul Armengaud, to counter the Rifian offensive. It covers the use of Breguet 14 A2 aircraft, the establishment of advanced airfields, and the coordination of air and ground operations.

The thesis outlines a research approach involving questionnaires and writing prompts focused on the child's country of origin to explore these connections.

It highlights the event's impact on Spanish politics, the military, and society. The introduction discusses the immediate aftermath of the defeat, including the high number of Spanish casualties and the political instability it caused, leading to Primo de Rivera's coup. It also covers the longer-term consequences, such as the rise of the 'africanista' faction within the Spanish army, the tarnished image of King Alfonso XIII, and the growth of anti-colonial resistance led by Abd el-Krim. The introduction also previews the various studies within the collection, which examine different facets of the disaster, including the Spanish army's organizational weaknesses, the role of the 'africanistas,' the perspective of the Riffian resistance, the actions of Abd el-Krim, the judicial investigations into military responsibility, and the planning for the Alhucemas landing.

Specifically, it addresses the notion that Abd-el-Krim's rebellion was suppressed solely due to French intervention, that Primo de Rivera lacked a strategic plan, and that the withdrawal from Chefchaouen aimed to avoid a defeat akin to Annual in July 1921. The article argues that while French aid was helpful, the Spanish army's strategy was the primary cause of Abd-el-Krim's defeat. It also asserts that Primo de Rivera and the Military Directory had a structured strategic plan and that the withdrawal from Chefchaouen was a strategic maneuver to draw the Riffians into attacking French zones, thereby forcing French intervention. The study is based on original documents from the Spanish Protectorate of Morocco and the army archives.

The author argues that the Spanish army's strategy was the main reason for Abd-el-Krim's defeat, that France requested Spain's help, that Primo de Rivera and the Military Directorate had a seven-action strategic plan, and that the withdrawal from Chefchaouen was a trap for both the Riffians and the French. The article details the initial conditions of Spanish colonization in Morocco after the Act of Algeciras of 1906, the key events of the Rif War, and the specific arguments against the three interpretations. It highlights the importance of intelligence, logistics, and political maneuvering in Spain's strategy. It describes the creation of intelligence networks, the implementation of a blockade of Tangier, the shift in military tactics, and the political strategy of winning over the local population.

It emphasizes how the 'Moroccan problem' heavily influenced Spanish political life during this period. The introduction discusses the historical context, beginning with Spain's renewed interest in Morocco in the late 19th century as a means to restore national honor after losing American colonies. It highlights the international agreements that carved up Morocco into zones of influence for France and Spain. The text then focuses specifically on the Disaster of Annual, outlining the factors that contributed to the Spanish defeat, including poor troop conditions, inadequate infrastructure, and leadership failures. It discusses the subsequent investigation (the Expediente Picasso), the efforts to rescue Spanish prisoners held by Abd el-Krim, and the political fallout, including the fall of governments and the rise of Primo de Rivera's dictatorship. The text also addresses the role of the 'Ejército de África' and the shifting public opinion concerning the Moroccan campaigns. Finally, it provides an overview of the articles included in the dossier, highlighting their contributions to understanding the complex relationship between Spain and Morocco during this era and the impact of the Moroccan issue on Spanish politics and society. The article mentions the military operations leading up to the 1925 Alhucemas landing and the subsequent defeat of Abd el-Krim.",

Sender's novel 'Iman' (1930) as a historical genealogy of the Disaster of Annual in 1921, within the broader context of the Rif War (1911-1927). It argues that the novel reconstructs the defeat from the perspective of Viance, a common soldier, who, as a subaltern, lacks a voice in the official discourse. The novel critiques the colonial policies of the Spanish state and the social pyramid that exploits Spanish and indigenous populations. By giving voice to the subaltern experience, 'Iman' questions the official narratives of heroism and patriotism, highlighting the human cost of the war and the suffering of ordinary soldiers. The novel also draws parallels between the feudal system in Spain and colonial expansion in Morocco, suggesting a shared history of oppression for both Spanish peasants and Rifian people. The article examines the novel's structure and narrative techniques, arguing that it subverts traditional war narratives and challenges the dominant historical and military discourses surrounding the Disaster of Annual.",

It details the historical context, including earlier Spanish military actions in North Africa, the challenges faced by the Spanish army in the Rif region, and the international political landscape surrounding Morocco. The analysis focuses on the events leading up to the battle, the key figures involved such as Abd el-Krim, General Fernández Silvestre, and General Berenguer, and the strategic and tactical errors that contributed to the Spanish defeat. It describes the weaknesses of the Spanish army, the strength and tactics of the Rif rebels, and the specific events of the battle, including the fall of Igueriben, the retreat from Annual, and the siege of Monte Arruit. The document concludes by examining the political and military consequences of the disaster, including the fall of the Spanish government, the investigation by General Picasso, and the subsequent changes in Spanish colonial policy.",

Primo de Rivera, like many military figures, believed that the existing constitutional government was leading Spain to defeat in Morocco. He aimed to unite the divided army and public opinion to either win the war or withdraw.

The study focuses on the contrasting images of the Spanish conquistador (represented by figures like General Silvestre), the Moroccan man, and the proposed ideal of the Spanish colonizer as a 'father figure.' The article argues that anxieties regarding Spain's place in the hierarchy of civilized nations were linked to its international position, colonial defeats like Annual in 1921, and negative perceptions of Spanish national identity. The perceived weaknesses of the Spanish colonial project, particularly after the defeat at Annual, are analyzed in relation to perceived shortcomings in Spanish masculinity, such as impulsiveness, reliance on brute force, and a lack of rational planning.

It mentions the disastrous defeat at Annual in the Rif War (Morocco) as a key event that fueled public discontent and demands for accountability, ultimately contributing to the military coup and subsequent dictatorship. The author argues that the dictatorship, intended to suppress dissent, ironically fostered anti-monarchist and republican sentiments across various segments of Spanish society, including socialists, intellectuals, and even some conservative elements. The text highlights how the desire to avoid responsibility for national disasters like Annual, and the perceived irresponsibility of the regime, drove the evolution of political thought in Spain.",

General Aguilera, president of the council, oversaw the investigation and attempted to justly assign blame. The Picasso Report (Expediente Picasso), initiated in August 1921, was submitted to the Consejo Supremo de Guerra y Marina in 1922 to determine penal responsibilities of military officers involved in the campaign that resulted in the disaster. The article asserts that the pursuit of those responsible contributed to the coup d'état on September 13, 1923. King Alfonso XIII may have been involved in the establishment of the dictatorship to evade accountability for the Annual disaster. The article also incorporates the views of Francisco Franco on the causes and responsibilities of Annual, expressed in letters from 1921-1923.",

It directly mentions the 'War of the Rif', and more specifically, the 'disaster of Annual' (Anual) in July 1921, where General Fernández Silvestre and approximately 10,000 Spanish soldiers were killed, and another 10,000 were taken prisoner by Abd el-Krim. The text attributes the defeat to Silvestre's poor planning and the inadequate equipment of the Spanish troops. It explains how the event caused a political crisis in Spain, leading to the resignation of the government. Furthermore, the article refers to a soldier from Calatayud, Fernando Hernández Moreno, who was a survivor of Annual, who died later in Malaga as a result of injuries sustained during the battle. The document also details the political atmosphere leading up to the coup d'état of Miguel Primo de Rivera in 1923, the elections to Cortes, and the municipal elections in Calatayud.

It begins by defining \"africanismo\" and distinguishing it from \"africanomilitarismo,\" highlighting different approaches to the Spanish Protectorate in Morocco. The article emphasizes how the Moroccan Protectorate became a \"fiefdom\" for the military, fostering a distinct mentality among officers seeking rapid advancement through war merits. It explores the characteristics of \"africanista\" officers, their motivations for serving in Africa, their colonial mindset, and their political ideologies, often rooted in conservatism and anti-democratic views. The foundation of the Tercio de Extranjeros (Spanish Foreign Legion) is examined as the epitome of \"africanista\" military thinking. The article then delves into the impact of the Disaster of Annual in 1921, arguing that it paradoxically reinforced \"africanismo\" and led to a brutalization of warfare, including extreme violence against the Moroccan population. It also touches upon the corruption within the Protectorate administration. Furthermore, the article analyzes the role of \"africanismo\" during the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera, the Second Republic, and the Spanish Civil War, highlighting the employment of colonial troops in mainland Spain and the influence of colonial ideologies on the conflict. Finally, it examines the evolution of \"africanismo\" during the Franco regime, its institutionalization, and its adaptation to changing political contexts, from imperialist ambitions to acceptance of Moroccan independence. The article concludes by emphasizing the enduring influence of \"africanismo\" on the Spanish army and its broader impact on Spanish history.",

It draws on parliamentary and journalistic sources to examine the historical problem and different perspectives on Spain's actions in Morocco. The study covers the background of Spanish involvement in Morocco, starting from the aftermath of the 1898 disaster and the establishment of the Spanish protectorate. It details the events leading up to the disaster of Annual in July 1921, where the Spanish army suffered a major defeat, with significant loss of life and territory. The document emphasizes the impact of Annual on Spanish public opinion, revealing that the war in Morocco was unpopular and costly and led to widespread criticism of the government and the military. It also explores the social costs of the war, particularly for the poorer classes, who were disproportionately affected by conscription and high mortality rates. The analysis includes information on the military budget, troop numbers, and the state of the Spanish army in Africa. It discusses the political debates surrounding the responsibilities for the defeat, with different factions blaming the government, the military, or even the King. The study also examines the rise of military discontent and the growing support for a military solution to the Moroccan problem. Finally, it describes the events leading up to the coup d'état by Primo de Rivera in September 1923, which was partly a response to the political crisis caused by the Annual disaster and the ongoing debate over responsibility.",

While it does not directly address the Battle of Annual (معركة أنوال), it is relevant because it examines the historical context of Spanish military culture and its relationship with religious practices, which influenced the attitudes, beliefs, and actions of Spanish soldiers and officers involved in the Rif War and the events surrounding the Battle of Annual. The article touches upon the history of the Spanish Legion, its links to the military campaigns in Morocco, and the broader social and political implications of military presence in religious events.

It investigates changes in thematic content, influenced by curriculum modifications or new historiographical trends. The text uses various textbooks from the present, the Transition period, and Emilio Castillejo's book for the Franco era. It finds progress in the treatment of the Spanish Civil War but notes that other conflicts are primarily presented from a political-military perspective, neglecting human costs. The study highlights the dominance of political and military events in shaping national sentiment, the focus on heroes, soldiers, kings, and statesmen, and the chronological narrative of events that facilitates memorization. It also criticizes the lack of references to the idea of Europe and inadequate attention to the human and economic costs of wars. The text includes a section specifically discussing the historiography and textbook treatment of the War of Africa and the Disaster of Annual, noting that while the event was initially widely discussed, it was later downplayed during the Franco regime. The analysis covers the evolution of historiographical approaches, from initial forgetfulness, through Anglo-French influences, to later studies incorporating social elements, and the rise of figures like Abd el Krim. It also discusses the limitations imposed by the lack of primary source access due to language barriers.",

It explores how the press portrayed the Rif people, particularly demonizing them and their actions during the war, and how this portrayal related to events and military outcomes. The article discusses the shift in the image of the Rif people from a paternalistic 'civilizing mission' to one of vengeance following Spanish defeats, highlighting the role of the press in shaping public opinion and supporting the war effort. It examines the demonization of the Rif enemy, the brutalization of the conflict, and the use of propaganda to garner support for the Spanish colonial project in Morocco. The article further analyzes how the press handled the news of the Desastre de Annual, the censorship imposed, and the discrepancies between the official narrative and the reality of the war. The paper explores the historical roots of the 'Moor' image and its evolution, including the use of stereotypes, racism, and the exploitation of religious and ethnic differences to justify the conflict. It investigates how the image of the 'Moro' was manipulated during the colonial war and later utilized during the Spanish Civil War. Finally, the article delves into various interpretations of the causes and consequences of the conflict, examining differing perspectives on the role of the press, the competence of military leaders, and the responsibility for the Spanish defeats.",

It examines Spain's neutrality during World War I, its role in the League of Nations, its relationship with Morocco, and its stance during the Spanish Civil War and World War II. The article touches on the political and economic factors influencing Spain's international relations and the different phases of its diplomacy, ranging from isolationism to attempts at integration. While the article does not explicitly focus on the Battle of Annual, it does contain many mentions of Spanish colonial policy in Morocco, the political and military situation that led to it, and the impact of military defeats there on domestic Spanish politics. It also covers Spanish relations with France and Germany regarding Morocco.",

            "Spain remained neutral during World War I (1914-1918) due to a lack of clear interests and internal debate between germanophiles and allied supporters.",

            "The disaster of Annual in 1921, where Spanish troops suffered a major defeat against Abd-el-Krim's forces in Morocco, contributed to political instability in Spain.",

            "During the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera, Spain focused on the League of Nations and Morocco, attempting to gain a permanent seat in the League's Council.",
            "Primo de Rivera's regime threatened to withdraw from the League of Nations in 1926 due to unmet demands, and briefly did so before rejoining in 1928.",

            "After the Spanish Civil War, Franco's regime initially aligned with fascist powers before adopting a neutral stance during World War II.",
            "Spain shifted from neutrality to non-belligerence in 1940, contemplating joining the war alongside Germany and Italy in exchange for territorial gains but ultimately did not due to German disinterest and Spanish weakness.",
            "The Spanish Blue Division was sent to fight on the Russian front alongside the German army in August 1941.",
            "In 1943, Spain reverted to a neutral position in World War II, seeking closer ties with Western powers due to the changing war situation.",

Revista De Historia Contemporánea' featuring the article 'Alfonso XIII, ese hombre: masculinidad, nación e imperio' by Margarita Barral Martínez and Alfonso Iglesias Amorín. The article, published on 09-10-2023, explores the redefinition of the modern male icon since the late 19th century, highlighting the abandonment of chivalrous ideals and the adoption of bourgeois values linked to nation and war. It argues that the strong, virile image of king-soldiers became the hegemonic masculinity. The article further analyses Alfonso XIII's definition as a Spanish male model, considering his hobbies, family image, humanitarian contribution during the Great War, and the colonial element tied to the occupation of Morocco. It posits that imperial colonialism brought Spain closer to Europe, crucial given its position on the edge of Orientalism and Africa. The article references Abd-el-Krim as jefe de la harca enemiga, and references Annual in it's bibliographical citations, specifically, Historia secreta de Annual(1999), Barcelona, Altaya, 2008, and also discusses the wars in the Rif region.",

The speech also briefly touches upon the political climate in Spain leading up to the Primo de Rivera coup in 1923, which was partly triggered by the Annual disaster and the fear of implicating the King in the scandal.

While its main focus is the dictatorship itself, it provides significant background on the political and social factors leading up to the dictatorship, including the disastrous defeat at the Battle of Annual in Morocco in 1921. The source details the impact of this defeat on Spanish society and politics, how it contributed to the crisis of the Restoration government, and how it ultimately facilitated Primo de Rivera's coup. The text also mentions the subsequent military operations in Morocco during the dictatorship, including the Alhucemas landing, undertaken to resolve the conflict which had led to the Annual disaster.",

            "The political system of the Restoration, initiated in 1875, experienced its zenith in 1898 with the 'Desastre del 98,' after which the system began to decline.",
            "Spain had universal suffrage since 1890, but was a liberal representative oligarchy, where the right to vote was distorted by corruption, local caciquismo, and vote buying.",
            "The defeat of 1898 in the Spanish-American War was interpreted as a national crisis and a failure of the Restoration State.",
            "Alfonso XIII took a more interventionist role in politics after ascending to the throne in 1902, particularly after 1913.",
            "Between 1914 and 1923, there were six general elections in Spain due to the inability to create stable governments.",
            "1917 marked a key point in the decline of the Spanish political system, with military juntas, demands from the Assembly of Parliamentarians, and a strike with revolutionary undertones.",
            "The Juntas Militares were formed to defend the interests of the Spanish Army, challenging the constitutional order.",
            "In August 1917, UGT and CNT called a railway strike that evolved into a general strike, which was violently suppressed, resulting in over 170 deaths.",
            "Following the defeat of 1898, Spanish colonial ambitions were directed towards North Africa, specifically the Rif region of Morocco.",
            "The summer of 1921 saw the Spanish army suffer a disastrous defeat at the Battle of Annual, with up to 12,000 Spanish deaths.",
            "The Battle of Annual led to the loss of 5,000 square kilometers of territory and fueled public demand for an investigation.",
            "The 'Informe Picasso' was produced after the Battle of Annual, implicating military leaders, politicians, and even the King, but its findings were never debated in parliament due to Primo de Rivera's coup.",
            "In Barcelona, social conflict resulted in strikes and state repression, further destabilizing the political system. Anarchists and employers resorted to violence, with 267 victims between 1920 and the 1923 coup.",
            "General Martínez Anido repressed syndicalists in Barcelona, weakening the CNT. This brutality was met with terrorism, escalating the violence.",
            "The coup of Primo de Rivera was a response to the crisis of the liberal system, aiming to resolve the Moroccan War and social conflicts.",
            "The European context of the Dictatorship of Primo de Rivera was defined by authoritarian regimes emerging after World War I.",
            "The dictatorship started on September 13, 1923, with a military pronouncement.",
            "Primo de Rivera assumed personal power, answering only to the King, and justified his actions through regeneracionismo.",
            "The dictatorship was presented as an answer to the desire for regeneration and an end to caciquismo, offering itself as a solution to the crisis of oligarchic liberalism.",
            "In the initial phase of the dictatorship, Spanish nationalism was reaffirmed in opposition to peripheral nationalisms.",
            "Social conflicts were suppressed by declaring a 'state of war' and limiting civil liberties. Anarchists were a primary target of repression.",
            "The Somatén was created as an organization for 'men of order' to repress those who fostered social disorder.",
            "In September 1925, a joint Spanish-French military operation at Alhucemas was a success and bolstered the prestige of the dictatorial system.",
            "The dictatorship was projected as temporary, but when it was seen that it intended to remain in power indefinitely, opposition began to form.",
            "There was no unanimity regarding the war in Morocco; the army was split between Africanists (favoring domination of the territory) and abandonment sectors.",
            "The government of Primo found several ways to approach the problems of Morocco, not always coherent with each other.",
            "The National Assembly was not an independent body, even though it housed a small section of opponents. It was effectively controlled by people loyal to the regime.",
            "In the economic sphere, the dictatorship accentuated practices of prior economic nationalism and, consequently, tariff protectionism.",
            "One focus of economic policy was public works, such as roads and railways to reduce unemployment.",
            "Monopolies were created, managed by private companies, such as Telefónica, CAMPSA, and CEPSA.",
            "In 1924, the Dictatorship was involved in several scandals regarding the award of monopolies, notably that of Juan March with tobacco.",
            "Calvo Sotelo proposed a fiscal reform with the intention of burdening the middle classes and large capitalists and rigorously prosecuting tax evasion.",
            "In the social sphere, the Civil Directory sought to regulate labor relations, creating corporations that integrated employers and workers, in which the State was also present as guarantor.",
            "The PSOE accepted representation in these corporations, and, as a consequence, tacitly accepted the legitimacy of the dictatorship, with the collaboration of the UGT being a key aspect for this system to continue.",
            "By the late 1920s, Primo de Rivera felt abandoned and ill (with diabetes), so announced his resignation."

          "source_summary": "This excerpt from Fermín Galán's novel \"La Barbarie Organizada\" and its introduction provides historical context regarding the Spanish colonial war in Morocco. The introduction discusses the origins of Spanish presence in North Africa from the 15th century, the instability of Spanish enclaves due to defeats, and the reduction of Spanish possessions to Ceuta, Melilla, and other smaller territories. It highlights the first colonial war in Morocco (1859-1860) led by Leopoldo O’Donnell and its motivations, including internal political gains. The text also touches upon the reintroduction of the 'Empire' debate, the involvement of other European powers in Morocco, and the emergence of literature and studies about the war and Africanism. The novel excerpt itself doesn't directly portray the battle of Annual, but introduces a character, Gustavo Pedrol de Nieva, who enlists in the Spanish Legion (Tercio de Extranjeros) and explores themes of disillusionment, hardship, and the search for meaning within the context of military life in the region.",

It argues that the defeat cannot be understood solely as a military failure but must be viewed within the broader context of European geopolitics, Spanish internal weaknesses, and the interplay of colonial interests, particularly those of France and Great Britain. The article traces the evolution of European strategic systems, Spain's position within them, and the events that led to Spain's involvement in Morocco, ultimately culminating in the circumstances surrounding Annual. It covers key figures like Maura, Primo de Rivera, and Lyautey, as well as the various agreements and crises that shaped Spain's presence in the region. The author underscores how internal Spanish instability and the need for international support and recognition influenced its actions in Morocco.

It examines how the newspaper initially adopted xenophobic stereotypes of Moroccans as 'invaders' to mobilize support against Franco's forces, who heavily relied on Moroccan troops. The article details the use of caricatures and articles in *Fragua Social* that portrayed Moroccans negatively, linking them to barbarism and foreign interference. However, as the war progressed, the newspaper also presented more positive images of Moroccans, aiming to discourage their recruitment into Franco's army and encourage desertion. This shift was partly driven by the need to counter Francoist propaganda and the growing number of Moroccan troops fighting for him. The article further explores how the CNT (Confederación Nacional del Trabajo) attempted to forge a revolutionary alliance with Moroccan nationalists and envisioned a future Iberian federation that included Morocco. Ultimately, the fluctuating images of Moroccans in *Fragua Social* reflected the changing dynamics of the Spanish Civil War and the CNT's evolving strategies and ideological tensions.",

It explores how the colonial failures in the Rif, including the Disaster of Annual (referenced indirectly through the criticism of the army and colonial policy) led writers to critique militarism, imperialism, and the romanticized view of Spanish history. The article identifies key authors in this movement, such as Eugenio Noel, M. Ciges Aparicio, R. José Sender, and J. Díaz-Fernández, and discusses their critical views on the Spanish army, colonial policies, and the impact of the Moroccan conflict on Spanish society. The article also analyzes how these writers portrayed the Moroccan perspective and its effect on revealing the complex identity of Spain, moving away from a mythical and static vision of the nation towards self-criticism and the search for objectivity.",

          "source_summary": "This article discusses the failed military reforms in Spain between 1898 and 1921, using Spain's colonial presence in Africa as a case study for the country's geopolitical and military decline. It connects the Disaster of Annual (معركة أنوال, هزيمة إسبانيا (المغرب)) in 1921 to the loss of the last Spanish colonies in America in 1898 and the persistent problems of an outdated, over-officered army with obsolete equipment and insufficient budgets. The article highlights several attempts at military reform before and after the colonial disaster of 1898, and how these failures contributed to the conditions that led to Annual. It also explores the motivations for Spain's presence in Morocco, including both its own interests and those of other European powers. The article examines the roles of key military figures and political leaders in the reform efforts and the resistance to change within the army. The article provides an analysis of the underlying causes of the defeat in the Battle of Annual and its consequences, placing this defeat within the broader context of Spanish military history and colonial policy. It details the events leading up to the battle, the internal problems of the Spanish army, and the political circumstances that influenced military decisions in Morocco. It further explores the failed reform attempts led by figures such as Polavieja, Linares, Weyler and Luque.",

            "Military leaders frequently intervened in political affairs, with some serving as presidents of the council of ministers.",
            "Attempts at military reform before 1898 were unsuccessful.",

            "Figures like Silvestre and Berenguer, key figures associated with the events leading up to the Disaster of Annual, were born in Cuba.",
            "The failure to modernize the army, which retained a structure dating back to the 1808 War of Independence, also contributed to the disaster.",
            "The 1808 uprising featured a popular army, which was a new phenomenon in Napoleonic Europe.",
            "The Constitution of Cádiz divided military forces into continuous service troops for external defense and internal order and national militias for provincial service.",
            "After the colonial disaster, the army needed reform due to officer saturation, but this reform was delayed until Azaña's law in the Second Republic.",
            "Many officers in Africa, including Silvestre, Berenguer, Capaz, and Mola, had family origins or backgrounds in Cuba.",
            "Following their return from Cuba, repatriated soldiers were met with abandonment and indignation.",
            "The Cuban conflict had two main repercussions: resentment of the military towards politicians and growing popular anti-militarism.",
            "Recruitment for the Cuban War disproportionately affected those without resources, as wealthier individuals could avoid service by paying a fee.",
            "Following Fachoda in 1898, the British ceded Morocco to France but feared a single power controlling the Strait of Gibraltar.",
            "Spain engaged in the First Moroccan War between August 1859 and March 1860, resulting in a Spanish victory.",
            "The Treaties of 1904, 1906 (Algeciras Conference), and 1912 led to Spain receiving territories configuring the Spanish protectorate of Morocco under the Treaty of Fez in 1912.",
            "In July 1909, General Pintos was killed in an ambush at Barranco del Lobo, along with over 1,000 soldiers, prompting Spain to reinforce Melilla with over 40,000 soldiers.",
            "By November 1909, the Spanish army controlled the area and its mining operations.",
            "In May 1910, a troop reduction was ordered, affecting garrison forces in Melilla.",
            "Between 1911 and 1914, military operations in Yebala resulted in the pacification of the most violent areas.",
            "In 1913, Canalejas was assassinated, with the military budget allocating significantly more to salaries than to goods and services.",
            "In 1914, Melquíades Álvarez criticized the excessive number of rewards granted in what he termed a 'police function' against irregular forces in Morocco.",
            "In July 1921, the army of Silvestre was destroyed, prompting initial disdain from France, which was also defeated by Rifian forces in 1925.",
            "The year 1921 was marked by enforced silence, though the Disaster of Annual remained deeply embedded in the public memory.",
            "Before the Disaster of Annual, the Spanish army was demoralized, involved in a colonial war for which it was unprepared, and suffering from failed reform attempts.",
            "The absence of military reform led to an institutional crisis, highlighted by the Juntas Informativas de Defensa.",
            "The fundamental problems of the Spanish army included an excess of officers, corporatism, political interference by generals, and the immunity enjoyed by senior commanders.",
            "General Manuel Cassola Fernández proposed a military reform in 1887, supported by Sagasta and Canalejas, but it failed due to opposition.",
            "López Domínguez, Minister of War in 1893, created Military Regions and attempted to reorganize the army, but faced criticism and resistance.",
            "After the defeat in Cuba, the army demanded greater funding, organizational reforms, and solutions to employment problems for repatriated soldiers.",
            "Generals Polavieja, Linares, Weyler, and Luque proposed various reforms to modernize the army after 1898.",
            "Polavieja advocated for modernizing the army and argued that being prepared for war was essential for peace.",

            "The Juntas de Defensa were triggered by Romanones' attempt to require fitness tests for military promotions, particularly resented by the infantry due to promotions in Morocco.",
            "Romanones advocated for a professional, democratic army, in contrast to the perceived elitism and antidemocratic nature of the German army.",
            "After Annual, the need for military reform was recognized, but reform efforts faced challenges, including political instability and military resistance.",
            "Manuel Azaña's reform sought a defensive, efficient army, politically neutral and prepared for war, but his vision was later undermined.",
            "Spain failed to implement a comprehensive military reform that addressed issues such as officer excess, obsolete equipment, and inadequate training, contributing to the Disaster of Annual.",
            "The core problems leading to the disaster include: An outdated army structure, an overabundance of officers compared to soldiers, insufficient funding for equipment and training, and a lack of meritocratic promotion systems.",
            "Spain's colonial ambitions in Morocco were partially motivated by a desire to keep the military occupied and to assert Spain's position among European powers.",
            "The reforms proposed often faced resistance from various factions within the military and political establishment, making it difficult to implement meaningful change."

The article discusses how the 'Disaster of Annual' (Desastre de Annual) directly led to the establishment of Primo de Rivera's dictatorship in 1923. A key objective of this dictatorship was solving the 'problem of Morocco' (solucionar el ‘problema de Marruecos’). The successful Alhucemas landing (desembarco de Alhucemas) was used by the regime as propaganda to legitimize its power and leadership by commemorating the so-called pacification of Morocco. The regime employed homages, awards to key figures, propaganda, and censorship to construct a specific memory of the Moroccan campaigns. Thus, the source examines the aftermath of Annual, its impact on Spanish politics, and the subsequent attempts to reframe the narrative through propaganda and censorship during Primo de Rivera's dictatorship, all in the context of the Spanish Protectorate in Morocco and the Rif War. The source also provides an extensive list of cited works which provides context for further research.",
