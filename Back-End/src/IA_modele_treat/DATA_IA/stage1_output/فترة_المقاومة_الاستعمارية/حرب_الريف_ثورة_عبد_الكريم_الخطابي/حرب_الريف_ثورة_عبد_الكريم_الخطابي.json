The chapter discusses the Rif War within the broader context of Algerian colonial history. It mentions the Entente Cordiale of 1904 where the UK conceded to France the freedom to act in Morocco, with a territorial reservation in favor of Spain: the Rif. The text also discusses the Treaty of Protectorate signed on March 30, 1912, between France and Sultan Moulay Hafid, and the different positions of France and Spain in Morocco afterwards. France gained the 'Maroc utile,' while Spain was entrusted with the Rif, a mountainous region.",

It investigates the shifts between a heroic and victimized narrative of the Rif, and how the Hirak movement revitalizes and innovates the memory of the Rif region, referring to the past to shape the present. Although the article mainly focuses on the Hirak movement (2016-2017), it references Mimoun Aziza's work on \"El otoño de la ira en el Rif. Los rifeños frente al Majzén marroquí (1958-1959),\" which connects to the broader history of social movements in the Rif. Additionally, the title of the journal issue mentions \"De Anual al Hirak: un estudio de los ciclos de movilización social en el Rif\", potentially referencing the Battle of Annual (1921) which is directly linked to the Rif War and Abd el-Krim.",

It examines the tension between social agency and structural factors in a Rif society that has transitioned from a primarily tribal society to one influenced by neoliberalism and the diaspora. Three major cycles of protest are identified, each evolving within a context of significant changes in the state, capital, and external influences: an initial cycle of anti-colonial revolts, a subsequent cycle of revolts under the newly independent state, and a final cycle of revolts during the neoliberal era. The article highlights both the distinct characteristics of these phases and the continuities between different mobilizations in this peripheral and marginalized region. These cycles of social mobilization have been driven by economic and social inequalities, as well as demands for political and identity recognition from a population acutely aware of its marginalization within the Moroccan state. The tensions between the Rif population and central authorities are primarily understood as a competition for power and resources between a center and a periphery, along with cultural resistance to external impositions. The authorities have predominantly responded to protests with coercive methods and have been unsuccessful in co-opting regional elites. The article references Abdelkrim as a key figure in the history of Rifian revolts.",

It connects the Hirak to a longer history of Rifian resistance, particularly highlighting the figure of 'Abd al-Krim al-Khattabi as a symbol of resistance against central power. The article explores the historical roots of the Hirak, including colonial-era wars, post-independence revolts, and the marginalization of the Rif region. It examines how protest songs served as a means of expressing grievances, disseminating messages, and fostering community during the Hirak. It details the repression faced by the movement, including the arrest of leaders like Nasser Zefzafi, and analyzes the themes and symbolism present in the songs, such as the critique of the Makhzen (Moroccan state), the call for freedom and justice, and the invocation of 'Abd al-Krim as a symbol of resistance. The study demonstrates how the Hirak movement utilized oral traditions, adapting them to modern media to express political and social discontent. The active participation of women in the Hirak, both through demonstrations and oral expression (like the izran songs), is also highlighted. It also makes observations on inter-regional tension within the Rif.",

The narrative also covers the author's interactions with Coon's son and David Hart, and Hart's ethnographic work on the Aith Waryaghar, including his book's coverage of the Rif War.

Regarding Morocco, it presents a counter-story of the post-2011 \"democratic transition\" focusing on the Hirak du Rif and Jerada uprisings. The article traces the reconfiguration of power relations in Moroccan society, highlighting mobilizations that took place at the margins. It covers land dispossession, privatization of resources, and struggles for self-construction and trade, particularly in the context of Amazigh mobilization and the legacy of Abdelkrim El Khattabi. It details the rise and repression of the Rif's Hirak movement, including the death of Mohcine Fikri, the subsequent protests, the arrest of Nasser Zefzafi and other activists, and the politicization of the Hirak's demands related to economic and social justice. The article argues that the microscopic conflicts at the edges of society are interwoven with global and regional transformations and highlights the importance of understanding these movements to grasp broader social and political dynamics in the region.",

The article examines how Mahbub's experiences question nationalist biases in postcolonial medical historiography, particularly regarding the role of Moroccans in the development of modern medicine amidst the European partition of Morocco. The article explores Mahbub's connections with various medical practitioners and the modernizing initiatives they embodied from the late nineteenth century through the 1930s, a period that encompasses the rise of Moroccan anticolonial nationalism. While the source is not directly about the Rif War or Abd el-Krim al-Khattabi, it does discuss the period of anticolonial nationalism in Morocco and mentions Hassan I's late nineteenth-century reforms, and implicitly touches upon the social and political environment that formed the backdrop of the Rif War through the lens of medical history.",

          "source_summary": "This paper discusses the concept of \"Tamazgha\" as a political and cultural project of the Amazigh (Berber) people, focusing on its historical development, scalar dimensions, and internal contradictions. It traces the evolution of Amazigh activism, highlighting the role of diasporic communities, cultural associations, and political movements in advocating for Amazigh rights and recognition. The article also examines the complex relationship between the Amazigh movement and North African states, noting instances of both resistance and co-optation. Specifically relating to حرب الريف ثورة عبد الكريم الخطابي (المغرب), the paper notes that Amazigh men and women played a central role in anti-colonial resistance, including the 1920s rebellion led by Abdelkrim al-Khattabi against Spanish occupation in the Rif.",
          "extracted_key_facts": [
            "Tamazgha is a transnational formation extending from the Siwa Oasis to the Canary Islands, from the Sahel to the Mediterranean basin, and includes the global Amazigh diaspora.",
            "Tamazgha functions as a transnational chronotope, invoking a specifically Amazigh past, present, and future within a region where their majoritarian presence has been historically minoritized by imperial powers.",
            "In 1967, the Berber Academy for Cultural Exchange and Research (ABERC) was founded in Paris to revitalize the Amazigh language and fight for Amazigh cultural rights in North Africa and the diaspora.",
            "The April 20, 1980 uprising in Tizi-Ouzou, known as the Amazigh Spring, was sparked by the cancellation of a lecture on “Ancient Berber Poetry” by Mouloud Mammeri.",
            "The World Amazigh Congress (CMA) was founded in 1997 in the Canary Islands by activists inspired by encounters with ethnic and indigenous rights militants.",
            "The paper mentions that Amazigh men and women played a central role in anti-colonial resistance, from the 1871 Kabyle insurrection against French settler colonialism to the 1920s rebellion led by Abdelkrim al-Khattabi against Spanish occupation in the Rif, and the organized campaigns against the final French “pacification” efforts in the Tafilalt oasis valleys and High Atlas mountains in the early 1930s.",
            "The transnational circulation of Amazigh folk music, videos, and texts has had a significant effect in expanding listeners’ cognitive maps of Tamazgha.",
            "Amazigh activists took center stage in the October 1988 riots in Algiers; the 2011 uprisings in Libya, Morocco, and Tunisia; and the more recent Hirak protests in Algeria and the Rif.",
            "The Moroccan state security agencies that once prosecuted and jailed Amazigh activists now have their headquarters inscribed with Tifinagh characters.",
            "Rural Amazigh men and women are protesting state expropriation and industrial spoliation of their lands and resources.",
            "Local artists and expatriate scholars are projecting a future Tamazgha emancipated from governmental demarcation through novels, music, images, poetry, and journals.",
            "The Sulaliyyat movement involves rural Moroccan women demanding their shares of collective lands and protecting them from individual (male) profit, corporate spoliation, and state expropriation.",
            "Female bards during the anti-colonial struggle sang less of their own roles than that of their kinsmen: lionizing the latter’s deeds, encouraging their bravery, and mocking them when they failed to perform hegemonic masculinity.",
            "The paper highlights the Jewish Shawiya queen Dihya Kahina, emphasizing her key role in contesting the Arab invasion of Numidia and even defeating the Umayyad forces at the Battle of Meskiana.",
            "The paper mentions Kabyle anti-colonial resistance leader Lalla Fatma N’Soumer who defended Kabylia from invading French forces in the 1840s and 1850s."

It highlights how nationalist movements in the region often downplayed Berber identity in favor of Arab and Islamic components.

          "source_summary": "This academic article examines the activism of the Riffian diaspora in Belgium and the Netherlands in the wake of the Hirak movement that began in Morocco's Rif region in October 2016. The Hirak protests stemmed from the perceived marginalization of the Rif region and gained support both in Morocco and among the diaspora in Europe. The article explores the motivations and actions of Riffian activists in Europe, analyzing their activism within transnational social spaces. It argues that diaspora activism is not solely about supporting the country of origin but also addresses grievances related to the diaspora's position in their countries of settlement. The study considers the interactions between the Riffian diaspora, the Hirak movement, the Moroccan government (Makhzen), and the Belgian, Dutch, and European governments. It highlights the Riffian diaspora's support for the Hirak, their resistance to the Moroccan government's diaspora policies, and their engagement with European governments and institutions to raise awareness and exert pressure. The article further details the historical-cultural denial experienced by the Riffians, the intimidation tactics employed by the Moroccan government against diaspora activists ('the long arm of Rabat'), and the ongoing debate surrounding dual citizenship. It examines the Riffian diaspora's interaction with the Hirak movement, their contestation of Moroccan state policies, and their engagement with the governments of Belgium and the Netherlands, as well as the European Parliament. Furthermore, the article mentions the role of Abdelkrim El Khattabi and the Riffian Republic of 1921-1926 as a historical reference point used by the protestors.",

          "source_summary": "This article, titled \"OPENNESS AND CLOSEDNESS OF THE POLITICAL SYSTEMS THAT CAUSED THE ARAB SPRING\", compares the political systems of Egypt and Morocco before the Arab Spring, using a historical approach to analyze pre-colonial, colonial, and post-colonial developments and their impact on political opportunity structures. It examines the openness and closedness of political systems in both countries, considering factors like political parties, civil society, the independence of legislative and executive branches, and the handling of opposition. Regarding Morocco, it details the pre-colonial era, including dynasties, invasions, and the weakening of the Moroccan army. It discusses the colonial period, focusing on the establishment of the French protectorate, armed resistance, notably that of Abdelkarim El-Khattabi in the Rif region who announced the Rif Republic in 1921, and the subsequent nationalist movements. The post-colonial section covers the reigns of Mohammed V, Hassan II, and Mohammed VI, highlighting the transition from autocracy to a slow process of liberalization, while addressing the persistent control of the palace (Al Mekhzen) and events like the Casablanca attacks of 2003. The article suggests that Morocco's regime demonstrated a certain amount of flexibility that allowed it to know when to confront the public with force and when to follow mainstream desires to avoid clashes. The study then contrasts Morocco’s political system with Egypt’s system and its impact on the Arab Spring in both countries.",

It examines the historical influences on Moroccan architecture, particularly during the French Protectorate, and analyzes the position of Morocco in the 21st-century architectural discourse. The thesis delves into the tension between modernism and tradition, the role of critical regionalism in non-Western countries, and the importance of considering local culture and sustainability in architectural design. It discusses the influence of the French Protectorate on Moroccan architecture, the roles of various architects, including those from CIAM and GAMMA, and their attempts to integrate modern designs with local culture and climate. The thesis also explores the perspectives of contemporary Moroccan architects on balancing tradition and modernity and improving the built environment. It includes a case study of Berkane in North-East Morocco, examining its housing types, urbanization challenges, and future visions for sustainable and culturally sensitive architectural development.",

          "source_summary": "This article discusses the socio-political and religious dynamics of Morocco, focusing on the interplay between tradition, Islam, and modernity. It explores the concept of hegemony as a framework for understanding Moroccan society, examining the roles of marabouts, zawiyas, and the monarchy in shaping the country's identity and power structures. The article traces the historical evolution of these dynamics, from pre-colonial times through the French protectorate and into the modern era. It highlights the tensions between central authority and regional autonomy, the influence of Islam in both its orthodox and popular forms, and the impact of capitalist penetration on traditional structures. Furthermore, it discusses the anti-colonial resistance, mentioning Abdelkrim Khattabi and his role in leading an independent republic in Northern Morocco. The article also touches upon the challenges facing contemporary Moroccan society, including demographic pressures, urbanization, and the rise of Islamic fundamentalism, arguing that these factors are undermining the traditional hegemonial balance.",
          "extracted_key_facts": [
            "The article argues that Western models fail to explain the specific developments in Third World countries like Morocco, where cultural tradition plays a guiding role.",
            "The author suggests the hegemonic model proposed by Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe is useful for understanding Moroccan reality because it considers non-economic factors in social change.",
            "The Moroccan king's power derives from the constitution, Islamic law (sharia), and his aristocratic descent from the Prophet Mohammed.",
            "Pre-colonial constitutions granted the king 'baraka' (magical, blessed power), and he is now called 'holy'.",
            "After independence in 1956, the colonial centralist administrative forms were continued.",
            "The article distinguishes between folk Islam and scriptural Islam in Morocco, both of which represent different ways of experiencing the same religion.",
            "Marabouts (folk saints) often claimed to be descendants of the prophet and criticized the central authority for collaborating with Spaniards and Portuguese.",
            "In the 17th century, the current dynasty of the Alawites came to power.",
            "Zawiyas (centers where marabouts are active) serve as centers for traditional alternative medicine, education, social gatherings, and accommodation.",
            "The article mentions that the power of the zawiya could easily develop into military-political power over a large region.",
            "The Islamic dynasties from the desert or mountains would conquer the central authority, which had become degenerate.",
            "The article highlights that anti-colonial resistance arose from brotherhoods and tribal federations from the beginning of the 19th century.",
            "Abdelkrim Khattabi led an independent republic in Northern Morocco from 1921-1925 after defeating the Spaniards.",
            "The urban middle class Independence Party viewed this popular resistance of leaders like Abdelkrim Khattabi with distrust, viewing them as disguised tribal rebellions.",
            "In 1912, the French protectorate was established, ending political independence until 1956.",
            "The article states that today, under pressure of different factors, a dichotomy is emerging in Moroccan society which makes hegemonic relations impossible.",
            "In the colonial regime, the lawful king Mohammed V was detained in Madagascar.",
            "The article details how after the penetrations of modern capitalism, collaboration and resistance efforts arose, with tribal chiefs guaranteeing monopolies of foreign powers.",
            "Colonial interpretation framed tribal rule as chaos, a false pretext for colonial rule, when the Moroccans often stood in solidarity against foreign intruders.",
            "The current constitution states the king is not only inviolable, but still 'holy'.",
            "The article identifies many factors contributing to a loss of hegemony in recent times, like pressure from demographic growth, urbanization, and proletarianization of the middle class."

The thesis examines the League's role as an intermediary for the Comintern to various colonies, assessing its structure and activities. The League against Imperialism and for National Independence (LAI) was established on February 10, 1927, at the \"First International Congress against Imperialism and Colonialism\" in Brussels. Preparations had begun in 1925 by Willi Münzenberg, a German communist, and the Communist International (Comintern). Berlin served as the center for the LAI and its International Secretariat from 1927-1933. The rise of the Nazi Party on January 30, 1933, led to the League's end in Berlin. The thesis uncovers the Comintern's reasons for supporting the LAI and its anti-imperialist agenda, disclosing a complicated undertaking with internal conflicts and power struggles, driven by communist ideology and strategy. The study references the Afro-Asian Conference in Bandung, Indonesia in 1955 as an example of the League's lasting influence on anti-colonial movements.",

The book identifies non-state actors as influential in the redefinition of security, and explores the impact of critical theory, postcolonial theory, and feminist theory on security studies.

The article focuses on Abd al-Krim's exile on Réunion Island in the Indian Ocean. The author aims to shed light on the backgrounds and reasons that led the imperialist powers to perpetrate the crime of occupying the Rif, killing its people, and exiling Abd al-Krim. The author also seeks to explore the reasons why Abd al-Krim and the people of the Rif paid such a heavy price in terms of equipment and supplies. The author also attempts to explain why France and Spain sacrificed more than 280,000 soldiers to control the small, mountainous region of the Rif, not counting the wounded, disabled, and material costs of the war. The text discusses the increasing European ambitions in the Rif following the Madrid Conference of 1880, which allowed European countries to own property in Morocco. This encouraged European powers to buy land in the Rif for mining activities, leading to intense competition between France, Spain, and Germany. The French company Compte de Chavagnac obtained contracts to purchase land in Jabal al-Hammam near the shrine of Sidi Boukhyar in 1882 through intermediaries, including al-Hajj Haddu al-Basha. Some land purchases in this area occurred as early as 1882, before the visit of the 'Count de Chavagnac' to the Rif, suggesting the presence of local agents working secretly for the Europeans. The author visited Reunion Island in April 2016 to investigate the conditions of Abd al-Krim's family there, and refers to research, testimonies and archives to present his study.",

The article discusses the peace negotiations in Oujda that took place between April 26 and May 7, 1926, during the Rif War. It highlights the shift in French strategy, with Marshal Philippe Pétain replacing Lyautey, and the French and Spanish inability to defeat the Rif resistance. The French leadership sought a negotiated settlement with الأمير محمد بن عبد الكريم الخطابي. The study examines the context, the preparatory talks, and the official opening of the negotiations. The article concludes that France and Spain were the primary beneficiaries of the truce, using the talks to create the impression of seeking a peaceful resolution.

It details the perspectives of the French, Spanish, and Rifian delegations, highlighting the conditions set by the colonial powers for peace and the reasons for the ultimate failure of the negotiations. The study examines the political and military context surrounding the Oujda conference, including the role of key figures such as Marshal Pétain, Resident General Steeg, and Abd el-Krim. It emphasizes the strategic interests of France and Spain in prolonging the conflict and how the negotiations were used to manipulate public opinion. It also discusses the internal divisions within the Rifian leadership regarding the peace terms. It analyzes the impact of the failed negotiations on the continuation and eventual outcome of the Rif War. The article highlights the demands made by France and Spain such as the exile of Abd el-Krim, complete disarmament, and submission to the Sultan, and the Rifian delegation's responses and counter-proposals. Ultimately, the article concludes that the Oujda conference was a strategic maneuver by France and Spain to buy time and consolidate their position, with no genuine intention of reaching a peaceful resolution with Abd el-Krim and the Rifian resistance.",

The Rif region was under Spanish influence and protection according to a 1912 agreement between France and Spain. The Rif is inhabited by Berber tribes, notably the Beni Urriaguel, the tribe of Abd el-Krim, the leader of the Rif Revolution.

The revolutionaries achieved victories against the Spanish, culminating in the Battle of Annual, a turning point that led to the declaration of the Republic of the Rif. Abd el-Krim formed a government to administer the newly independent region. The success of the Rif Revolution alarmed European powers, particularly France, which feared for its interests in North Africa. France supported Spain against the Rif rebels. The combined forces eventually defeated the revolutionaries, leading to Abd el-Krim's surrender to the French army.

It examines the divergence between the two political groups, starting from the Congress of Tours in 1920, continuing through the immediate aftermath, and focusing on the period of the Rif War in the 1920s. The source details how the socialists, despite some internal conflicts, generally supported the French colonial project, while the communists, adhering to the Comintern's directives, actively opposed it and supported Abd el-Krim's rebellion. The document also highlights the repression faced by communists due to their anti-colonial stance.

It investigates why the Rif people, unlike other groups such as Sephardim, do not have access to Spanish nationality after a reduced residence period. The study explores the historical context of the Spanish protectorate in the Rif, including the Rif War, the use of chemical weapons, and the subsequent struggle for independence. It also touches upon the marginalization of the Rif region by the Moroccan state and the ongoing demands for autonomy. A central argument is that the Rif people deserve similar consideration to Sephardim in the acquisition of Spanish nationality, given their historical ties and shared experiences of oppression. The thesis reviews relevant legal texts, historical events, and scholarly works to support this argument, including discussion of the Rif War. The source highlights the use of chemical weapons by the Spanish army during the Rif War, leading to long-term health consequences for the population. It also mentions the devastation and resistance in the Rif, emphasizing the need for historical justice and recognition of rights.",
