          "source_summary": "The text discusses the Moroccan national movement between 1946 and 1952, focusing on the role of Sultan Muhammad Ibn Yusuf and the Istiqlal Party. It details the political restrictions imposed by the French protectorate, the limited development of political parties, and the Sultan's increasing role as a leader of the national movement. The text highlights the Istiqlal Party's program, its influence on different social layers, and its relationship with other parties, including the Communist Party and the Democratic Party of Independence. The article also describes the Sultan's pivotal Tanger speech in 1947, his efforts to negotiate with the French government, and the subsequent hardening of the French stance under General Juin. The text further covers the Istiqlal's efforts to gain international support, its stance on American military bases, and the social conflicts guided by the UGSCM. It also discusses the formation of a united front between Moroccan parties in 1951 and their efforts to gain international recognition, particularly from the U.N.",

            "Political human rights were more restricted in Morocco than in Tunisia during the period.",
            "Political parties were not legally formed in Morocco but were tolerated to some extent, although their press was strictly controlled.",
            "Trade unions were not allowed for Moroccans, with their interests represented by CGT, later UGSCM.",
            "UGSCM (General Union of Moroccan Trade Unions) had 40,000 European and 20,000 Moroccan members in 1946 and kept close ties with the French trade union center.",
            "The Istiqlal Party, among the three Maghreb countries, was the first to choose the United States of America as its international confederate and recognize the significance of the U.N.",
            "The Istiqlal Party influenced each social layer in Moroccan society more significantly than the Communist Party or the Democratic Party of Independence (PDI).",
            "The Istiqlal Party refused the reforms of the summer of 1947, declaring that \"the first real reform will be the abolition of the Protectorate\".",
            "The Istiqlal Party supported the territorial integrity of the country and the re-establishment of the unity of the dismembered Morocco, including the Spanish Sahara.",
            "The Istiqlal Party regarded the Sultan as the symbol of Moroccan unity and agreed on the plan to keep close relations between the independent Morocco and France.",
            "The Istiqlal Party operated more as a movement than a party, based primarily on the merchant-bourgeoisie of cities like Fez and Rabat.",
            "After the war, the Istiqlal Party aimed to achieve its purpose through legal frameworks, bombarding colonial authorities with petitions and memoranda.",
            "The Istiqlal's program for 1947 stated that only the profound revision of the contract of the protectorate could be the basis of normal French-Moroccan relations.",
            "The Istiqlal sent a memorandum to the U.N. at the end of 1947, arguing that the Moroccan nation was a coherent political system before the French arrival, making the protectorate illegal.",
            "The PDI, led by Wazzani, collected Francophile intellectuals and struggled for the absolute independence of the country, aiming for \"a political and social democracy\".",
            "In the summer of 1946, the Moroccan Communist Party (MCP) approved of national independence, the re-establishment of the territorial integrity of the country, and the formation of a national assembly.",
            "The Istiqlal Party rejected the MCP's suggestion of establishing a National Front, viewing the MCP as not truly Moroccan.",
            "In April 1947, Muhammed Ibn Yusuf visited Tanger, demonstrating the unity of Morocco and demanding independence.",
            "In his speech of April 9, 1947, in Tanger, the Sultan expressed his regret for the backwardness of the country and encouraged his compatriots to learn modern techniques, expressing confidence in their political awakening and the reclaiming of their rights.",
            "The Sultan's Tanger speech in 1947 is considered a milestone, marking his explicit joining of the forces struggling for national development and freedom.",
            "General Alphonse Juin was appointed as resident general, restricting the activity of the nationalists and enforcing their leaders to leave the country.",
            "The Istiqlal opened the Moroccan Informational Bureau in New York at the end of 1947.",
            "The Istiqlal and the Sultan did not oppose American military bases because they believed \"the American presence lessens a little the French pressure on us.\"",
            "In 1948, Moroccan wage-workers theoretically got child bounty with certain restrictions due to efforts made by UGSCM.",
            "In October 1950, the Sultan sent a memorandum to the President of the Republic, Vincent Auriol, demanding fundamental structural reforms.",
            "The French response on October 31, 1950, was disappointing, leading to continued debates and struggles.",
            "In December 1950, resident general Juin removed Istiqlal members from the hall for criticizing the protectorate, prompting the Sultan to demonstrate his approval of them.",
            "Hajj T'Hami, the leader of the Glawi tribe, accused the Sultan of Istiqlal-communist friendship in December 1950.",
            "In July 1951, the United States built five air bases in Morocco as part of an agreement.",
            "On April 9, 1951, the Istiqlal and PDI, along with two Spanish Moroccan parties, signed an agreement in Tanger declaring they would not enter negotiations before the acknowledgement of the country's independence."

While it doesn't focus specifically on the formation of the Istiqlal party or the national campaign directly, it uses the Istiqlal party as a case study to understand the broader issue of political pluralization in Morocco. It questions why the Istiqlal party didn't become a single-party regime and how pressures for pluralization have affected the Moroccan political system. The chapter suggests a model of political development considering both unipartism and political pluralism. The analysis seeks to understand the interplay of interests, factions, and power within the developing Moroccan polity after independence. The author examines whether the nationalist movement united or remained divided. The provided notes refer to sources from the mid-1960s. The chapter was originally written in 1967 and re-evaluated the King's strategy after the 1972 coup.",

The article also examines internal divisions within the Istiqlal, the formation of the Parti Democratique de L’Independence (Democratic Party of Independence, PDI), and the establishment of the Popular Movement by former ALM leaders, all contributing to the weakening of the Istiqlal's influence. The source covers the Istiqlal's attempts to maintain power, including repressive measures and the eventual split within the party in 1958.

          "source_summary": "This article, \"The Origins and Early Development of the Union Marocaine du Travail\" by Robert D. Forst, published in the International Journal of Middle East Studies in April 1976, examines the development of trade unionism in Morocco, particularly the Union Marocaine du Travail (UMT). It discusses how French syndicalism had limited influence on Moroccans before 1936, despite the Front Populaire's dahir of December 24, 1936, which granted syndical liberties to Europeans. The French Congrès Général du Travail (CGT) recruited Moroccan miners, enrolling over a thousand by the end of 1937 in Khouribga. The French administration, alarmed by Moroccan union participation, presented a dahir to Sultan Mohammed Ben Youssef to forbid Moroccans from forming unions, which he signed, viewing unions as a threat to the Makhzen's authority. However, this 1938 dahir was not strictly enforced. One of the first nationalist demands in 1934 ('plan de reformes') was the right to form trade unions. Initially, the nationalist movement, led by figures like Abderrahim Bouabid, discouraged Moroccan workers from joining the CGT due to concerns about French influence. Later, they decided to enter the CGT en masse to fight from within. The article highlights the rivalry between the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) in Morocco, with WFTU leaders like Monsieur Klain actively reorganizing the CGT to counter the ICFTU and the UMT. Ben Seddiq and Bouazza met with French socialist representatives on March 7 to discuss ICFTU affiliation. Abdelkader Awab and Mohammed Tibari were elected as UMT's Treasurer-General and Deputy Treasurer-General, respectively. In June 1955, the UMT's Bulletin No. a demanded the release of political detainees and the lifting of the state siege. Al-Istiqlal criticized the authorities, revealing early differences between the Union and the party. The UMT building, originally built for the CGT, was provided to the UMT by the Moroccan government, with utilities and equipment funded by public treasury. Al-Istiqlal published articles about the UMT in March 1956 and May 1957. Maroc Monde discussed modifications to the status of foreigners in Morocco in September 1957. Collective conventions and labor relations are discussed, drawing from various articles published between 1956 and 1958. An interview with Mahjoub in Al-Istiqlal, May 25, 1957, omits any mention of Istiqlal's role in the labor movement.",

It analyzes the factors contributing to political stalemate, including low voter participation, the failure of the Left, and the rise of Islamists.

It investigates the roles and challenges faced by various political parties, including the Istiqlal Party, the Justice and Development Party (PJD), the Socialist Union of Popular Forces (USFP), and the Authenticity and Modernity Party (PAM). The analysis includes historical context, such as the configurations of Moroccan politics since independence. The paper further explores the monarchy's strategic choices, the disconnect between the administration and the political class, and the crisis within political parties. It analyzes internal dynamics, electoral performance, and the impact of these factors on the overall political landscape in Morocco.",

The book details Shakib Arslan's life, his adoption of the Arab cause, his advocacy for Islamic nationalism in the Arab East, his role as a mentor in North Africa, and his views on tradition. While the full text of the chapter is inaccessible, the context suggests that it contains information relevant to the intellectual and political climate within which Moroccan nationalist movements, including the formation of حزب الاستقلال and the national campaign, emerged. The reference to Arslan's influence in North Africa suggests a direct connection to the ideological underpinnings of nationalist movements in the region.",

While the primary focus is on the 2016 elections and the political landscape of that time, it references the Istiqlal Party's performance in the 2011 elections and mentions its participation in the government led by the PJD until its withdrawal in 2013. Additionally, it notes the Istiqlal Party's second-place finish in the 2011 elections with 60 seats, directly behind the PJD's 107, which is relevant to understanding the political dynamics before and after the formation of the PJD-led government. The document also briefly touches on King Hassan II’s attempts to integrate political Islam (and by extension, potentially parties such as Istiqlal) into the parliamentary system in 1997. While the main subject is not directly about the Istiqlal party's founding and national campaign, the information given about the Istiqlal party's political strength in 2011 and its historical role makes it partially relevant.",

The PI's first public act was the \"Independence Manifesto\" of January 11, 1944, which called for Moroccan independence and the establishment of a democratic regime under the Sultan's leadership. The article also notes that King Mohammed V allied with the nationalist forces, which led to his deposition by the French in 1953 and his restoration in 1955, making him a hero of the independence cause. The PI envisioned itself as the natural party of power after independence, aiming to create a constitutional monarchy approved by the Sultan in 1944.",

          "source_summary": "This paper examines prospects for political reform in Morocco, focusing on non-Islamist reformist actors in civil society. It provides an overview of Morocco's political landscape, rooted in King Hassan II's reign starting in 1961, marked by authoritarianism despite nominal separation of powers. The king consolidated executive and legislative branches, and dissent was repressed. Support for the king was renewed in the mid-1970s due to the Western Sahara issue and the 1973 war against Israel. The Green March achieved expansion into Western Sahara. Hassan later allowed political participation, proposing the Alternance power-sharing system in 1993, leading to a socialist-led coalition government in 1996. Mohammed VI, after Hassan's death in 1999, initiated modernization efforts, including protections for women and minorities. The Makhzen, Morocco's ruling elite, controls key economic sectors. The parliament is bicameral, but the king retains significant authority. Parliamentary elections were held in 2011, but issues persist with representation and judicial independence. Numerous political parties exist, but many are seen as extensions of the palace. Key non-Islamist parties include the Party of Authenticity and Modernity (PAM), Istiqlal, RNI, and USFP, though they are seen as undemocratic. The RNI is historically close to the palace, the PPS is a socialist-nationalist party, and the MP is associated with the Amazigh. Istiqlal led Morocco’s nationalist movement in the 1950s, and the USFP has been tempered by co-optation. The PAM was founded by a confidant of Mohammed VI and represents the palace. The business community has a policy veto and complementary interests with the palace. Civil society is strong, and single-issue organizations (SIOs) address various issues. The 2011 uprisings led to constitutional reforms, but the king maintains control. The February 20 Movement (M20F) floundered due to fragmentation. Democratic development organizations, women’s rights groups, and human rights groups all play roles in Moroccan civil society. Amazigh-linked movements have varying relationships with the palace. Trade unions are politicized and affiliated with political parties. The UMT, CDT, and UGTM are the largest trade union federations. Three obstacles to deeper democratic reform are the monarchy's reluctance to delegate authority, regime co-optation of civil society, and the Islamist-secularist divide. Potential promise is found in palace-aligned parties calling for authentic democracy and local-level service implementation. Organizations like the Democracy and Modernity Collective (CDM) seek to bridge the Islamist-secular divide.",

While the book's primary focus is on citizenship in the Arab world, one chapter, \"Patronage and Democratic Citizenship in Morocco\" by James Sater, directly addresses issues of citizenship within the Moroccan context. While it doesn't directly describe the formation of the Istiqlal party or the National Campaign in Morocco, it discusses citizenship in Morocco, which is a relevant aspect, especially in light of Chapter 17, \"The Narrow Path: Acts of Citizenship by the Arab YouthLessons from Egypt and Morocco\" by Assia Boutaleb. The book, published in 2017, examines historical, legal, and political development of state-citizen relations in the Middle East and North Africa, encompassing concepts of citizenship, social pacts, Islamic movements, secular movements, and factors obstructing citizen rights, such as patronage and clientelism. Several chapters cover specific countries, including Morocco and the overall anthology could provide a broad context for understanding the dynamics within which the Istiqlal Party was formed and its National Campaign was conducted.",

Specifically, it mentions the overwhelming desire for national unity, the role of the Istiqlal party, its merger with the National Reforms Party of the northern zone, and Mehdi Ben Barka's \"Road of Unity\" initiative.

It examines the economic, political, and social marginalization of the former Spanish Morocco and its nationalist elite after Morocco's independence. The article also highlights the distinct administrative and political systems that existed under the Spanish and French Protectorates and how the French-speaking nationalist elite became dominant in post-independence Morocco, influencing the political landscape. The study analyzes the post-colonial era in Tetouan, revealing a similar dynamic of political marginalization to that experienced by the Rif region but expressed through different demands and political projects. The Moroccan nationalist elite of Tetouan during the colonial period had unique intermediary relationships with the Spanish colonial power, setting them apart from those in the French Protectorate. This intermediary role and the subsequent marginalization after independence shaped the region's political and social trajectory.",

It traces Moroccan history to the Arab conquests, studying the roles of traditionalism, Islam, the monarchy, elites, and education in shaping political development. The growth of Moroccan nationalism and the formation of political parties, including the Istiqlal Party and its subsequent splits, are analyzed. The source also discusses key figures like al-Fassi and Hassan II, significant events such as the exile and return of Mohammed V, the declaration of a state of emergency in 1965, attempted coups, and the Western Sahara issue. The study also reviews United States military and economic aid to Morocco and its correlation with Moroccan support for United States policies based on United Nations voting patterns.",

It touches upon several key aspects relevant to the Istiqlal party. Specifically, the text mentions the Istiqlal party's participation in a coalition government in March 1998, headed by Abd al-Rahman Yussufi (USFP), marking the first time since 1960 that the monarchy entrusted authority to opposition parties. It frames this move as a confidence-building measure toward increased democratization. Furthermore, the article notes that in the September 2002 legislative elections, the Istiqlal party secured 48 seats, becoming a major player in the new government. Yasima Baddu from the Istiqlal party was also appointed as the Minister of Family Affairs. The text also references the Istiqlal party's newspaper L'Opinion and its perspective on the success of women's associations in Moroccan politics.",

It connects this to the historical limitations on women's access to public space, tracing it back to the first Moroccan family law adopted in 1947 and examining the modifications up to 2004. The article highlights the role of women in the Moroccan independence movement and the emergence of women's groups associated with the Istiqlal Party (Independence Party) and Shura and Independence Party in the 1930s and 1940s. These groups advocated for women's education and rights, marking the beginning of a formal women's movement that demanded access to public spaces. The article also mentions Princess Aicha's speech in 1947, encouraging women to fight for their freedom alongside men, and the impact of the family code on women's rights. Ultimately, the article concludes that despite women's participation in the independence movement and subsequent legal modifications, true emancipation and equal access to public spaces remain complex and challenging issues.",

The document highlights the gap between the regime's reform rhetoric and actual practices, citing examples like the arrest of journalist Ali Anouzla and the appointment of technocrats loyal to the Palace. It examines the constitutional reforms of July 2011, noting that while they brought some improvements, the King retains significant powers. It also assesses the role and limitations of the PJD-led government, the acquiescence of political elites, and the impact of social media on changing attitudes. The paper concludes with recommendations for the EU to encourage genuine reform in Morocco, focusing on accountability and transparency.

It examines the political maneuvering, the involvement of King Mohammed VI, and the subsequent formation of a new governing coalition, with the RNI replacing Istiqlal. The article also delves into constitutional interpretations and the implications for the balance of power between the monarchy and the elected government. Specifically regarding the Istiqlal party, it details their internal tensions, their demands from the government, the decision-making process behind the withdrawal, and the aftermath of their departure, including their move to the opposition.",
          "extracted_key_facts": [
            "On January 3, 2013, Hamid Chabat, the new leader of the Istiqlal party, sent a memorandum to Prime Minister Abdellilah Benkirane demanding a cabinet reshuffle and greater influence over the government's agenda.",
            "Chabat's demands, made on the anniversary of the PJD's first government, threatened the withdrawal of Istiqlal ministers if his conditions were unmet.",
            "Chabat believed that Istiqlal's participation in the government under Abbas El Fassi was negotiated below the party's electoral weight.",
            "Istiqlal opposed unpopular measures like the reform of the Caisse de compensation and pension reforms, fearing electoral consequences in the 2015 and 2016 elections.",
            "By late March 2013, Chabat submitted another list of demands, seeking to rectify the government's course.",
            "On May 11, 2013, the National Council of Istiqlal publicly announced the party's decision to withdraw its ministers from the government.",
            "Istiqlal’s withdrawal initiated a government crisis lasting nearly ten months, concluding with the formation of a new government before the October parliamentary session.",
            "The Istiqlal party's communiqué mentioned Article 42 of the Constitution, appealing for royal arbitration in the conflict, raising questions about its appropriateness.",
            "King Mohammed VI reportedly called Hamid Chabat, requesting that Istiqlal ministers remain in the government and postponing the withdrawal decision until his return from abroad in mid-June.",
            "On July 10, Mohammed VI accepted the resignations of five Istiqlal ministers submitted by Prime Minister Benkirane.",
            "Mohammed El Ouafa, the Istiqlal minister of Education, initially refused to resign, claiming allegiance only to the king; he was later excluded from the party but remained in the subsequent government.",
            "Following the departure of Istiqlal, the RNI joined the government coalition, leading to a cabinet reshuffle on October 10, increasing the number of ministers from 31 to 39.",
            "With the departure of Istiqlal, PJD lost key portfolios like Foreign Affairs and Industry to the RNI.",

It discusses the political climate leading up to the elections, including the state of exception imposed in 1965, the return of M. Guedira, and the boycott announced by the main opposition parties (the Parti de la Libération et du Socialisme and the Union Nationale des Forces Populaires). However, the Istiqlal party changed its stance and encouraged its members to vote. The document highlights the unequal access to media and propaganda during the campaign, with the government-aligned media dominating the airwaves and print. It details the Istiqlal party's campaign of denouncing administrative abuses and the government's response, including seizures of newspapers. The results of the elections are presented, showing the dominance of 'neutres' and the Mouvement Populaire, and a significant decline in the representation of the Istiqlal and the U.N.F.P. in local assemblies. The document concludes by discussing the Moroccan government's intention to rejuvenate the local administration and prove the population's disconnection from political formations, but also raises concerns about the potential discrediting of elections and democracy at the local level.",

It mentions Fez as the birthplace of Moroccan nationalism and the initial role of the Fassi bourgeoisie in funding and leading the movement. The article notes the shift of the bourgeoisie's activities to Casablanca in the 1930s and the subsequent perception of a 'Fassi colonialism' after independence. The article also addresses the demographic changes in Fez after independence, including the departure of elites and the influx of rural immigrants. It examines whether Fez can maintain its national role culturally and politically, considering the economic shifts. The article further describes how the University of Karaouyne continues to attract rural students. Finally, it concludes that the political phenomena in Fez reflect a slow evolution of social structures and the persistence of dependency ties. Therefore, it is relevant to the topic.",

The article discusses the history and evolution of political parties in Morocco, particularly those emerging from the nationalist movement, from 1934 to the early 2000s. It examines the constraints placed on these parties by the monarchy and the nature of political competition in the country. The article's plan includes a section explicitly dedicated to \"Mouvement national et pluralisme partisan (1934-1956)\" which covers the period directly relevant to the formation of the Istiqlal party.

La notabilisation parlementaire d'un parti de militants au Maroc\" by Mounia Bennani-Chraïbi, discusses the evolution of parliamentary recruitment in Morocco, with a particular focus on the Union Socialiste des Forces Populaires (USFP). It analyzes the shift in the USFP's composition from a party of militants to a party of notables, particularly in the context of the 2007 legislative elections. While the article doesn't directly discuss the formation of the Istiqlal party or the national campaign, it provides valuable context about the Istiqlal party in relation to the broader political landscape of Morocco after independence in 1956. It mentions Istiqlal as the party of the \"vieille garde bourgeoise,\" nationalistic, citadine, and commercante, in the 1960s. The article thus offers insight into a key political actor's place in the evolving Moroccan political system, and by extension sheds some light on factors that may have influenced the climate in which Istiqlal was formed and the national campaign took place.",

While the main focus is on the political dynamics and power-sharing within the new government, it also mentions the Istiqlal party (حزب الاستقلال)'s participation. Specifically, it details the Istiqlal's negotiation for ministerial positions and their eventual acceptance of six posts. Furthermore, the article touches on the broader context of political competition between the monarchy and the Mouvement National, from which Istiqlal emerged. Thus, while focusing on the 1998 \"alternance,\" the text contains information related to Istiqlal and the historical context of its relationship to the Moroccan political landscape.",

            "In 1992-1994, attempts to include the Koutla in the government failed partly due to disagreements over ministerial positions, including the Interior ministry.",
            "The Istiqlal party, despite electoral setbacks, waited for its 13th congress and the election of Abbas El Fassi as its new Secretary-General before agreeing to join the government on February 22, arguing that its participation should reflect its political weight in society.",

The chapter discusses the resurgence of national emancipation movements in North Africa, particularly in Algeria, after World War II. It mentions the role of national-reformists and the Parti Communiste Français (P.C.F.) in advocating for reforms within the colonial regime. The text also mentions a message sent by Ferhat Abbas on December 20, 1942, to Anglo-American and French authorities, demanding an assembly of Muslims to discuss political, economic, and social rights as a condition for Muslim participation in the war effort.

It explores how King Hassan II utilized nationalist discourse, particularly regarding territorial issues, as a tool to unify the diverse society and preserve the monarchy. The article references the Istiqlal party as one of the main political opponents that the king sought to diminish the influence of. The Grand Maroc concept, as presented by Allal El Fassi, a leader in the Istiqlal party, is also discussed.

It examines how the Istiqlal party attempted to assert its authority, leading to a power struggle with the Sultan (later King Mohammed V), who resisted being relegated to a purely honorific role. It also details the divisions within the Mouvement National, including the split between the Istiqlal party (representing the conservative wing) and the Union Nationale des Forces Populaires (UNFP), which encompassed a more socialist and third-worldist perspective. The article also explores the relationship between the monarchy and political parties in Morocco, detailing how the palace has historically played a role in managing and co-opting opposition forces, and how this has shaped the political landscape. In doing so, the article covers key moments in Moroccan political history, including the first elections of independent Morocco in May 1960, as well as the establishment of the 1962 constitution, which enshrined the King's role as commander of the faithful.",

While the entire book delves into the subject more comprehensively, the introduction and summaries provided discuss the emergence of nationalist sentiments among educated Maghrebi youth, the colonial policies that influenced their formation, and how these elites later played crucial roles in the independence movements and the subsequent establishment of national states. It mentions how the colonial authorities attempted to use education to create a loyal elite but inadvertently fostered nationalist sentiments. It talks about the early nationalist contestation linked to the Berber Dahir. It highlights how the interwar period saw increasing demands for education and the rise of nationalist associations among students.

The author also examines the limits of political participation and the role of representation and intercession in the system. It touches on the complexities of political engagement, particularly for organizations like the Moroccan Organization for Human Rights (OMDH). Although the text doesn't directly detail the formation of the Istiqlal party, it *does* discuss the party's relationship with the monarchy and other religious currents, as well as highlighting a specific instance when the party was attacked for not adhering to \"orthodox salafia\" standards.

It references the Istiqlal party's origins as a key component of the Mouvement National, its initial dominance, and subsequent fragmentation and competition within the political sphere, making it indirectly relevant to understanding the environment in which the Istiqlal party was formed and operated.

          "source_summary": "The article discusses the transformations in Moroccan electoral politics since the 1990s, particularly focusing on the changing strategies of the USFP (Union socialiste des forces populaires), a left-wing party, in the face of evolving electoral dynamics and the rise of other parties such as the PJD (Parti de la justice et du développement) and the continued presence of parties like Istiqlal and RNI. It examines how the USFP, after its time in government, had to adapt to a changing electoral market, where the electorate of traditional leftist parties shrunk, and the more culturally and materially endowed voters deserted the polls. The article analyzes the mutations within the USFP regarding candidate selection, the resources deployed, and the profiles of electoral agents. The study, based on ethnographic observation of a 2009 communal election in Casablanca, sheds light on the complex processes of politization, the blurring of lines between 'militant parties' and 'notable parties,' and the increasing role of clientelism and vote-buying. It highlights the inversion of the electoral 'cens,' where marginalized groups demand payment for their votes while more privileged citizens abstain. The article underscores the challenges faced by the USFP, its shift towards incorporating businessmen and local figures, and the implications for the party's identity and electoral performance. The author explores the strategies of the Istiqlal party as an example of a party consolidating itself through clientelism.",

It argues that this region, while diverse, possesses a certain cultural unity, being primarily within the sphere of influence of Fès and its traditional culture linked to local elites and political parties. The chapter also highlights the significant influence of French culture and administration in the region, leading to the emergence of modern local elites who were more connected to national elites and sensitive to ideological factors. Furthermore, it emphasizes that the nationalist movement's action in reaction to French actions has been active in the region since its creation, making it a key area of early militant action. The source pinpoints the period following World War II and the radicalization from 1953 to 1955 as especially formative for the political engagement of local party cadres.

It analyzes the forces at play within the Moroccan political system, including the monarchy, various political parties (both those aligned with the 'makhzen' or establishment and those in the 'competing' family of parties, many from the Mouvement National), and the constraints on democratization. The article delves into the constitutional framework that supports the monarchy's power, the concept of a 'supra-constitution,' and the roles of the king as both a secular and religious leader. It also examines the negotiations leading to the 'alternation' government led by El-Youssoufi, the limitations of this government, and the potential future scenarios for political development in Morocco under King Mohamed VI. It specifically mentions the Parti de l'Istiqlal (Party of Independence) and its role in the power dynamics of the Moroccan political system after independence, particularly its initial competition with the monarchy and subsequent weakening due to internal contradictions and maneuvers by the ruling power. The article portrays a complex picture of a political system where the monarchy retains significant power, and where true democratization faces many challenges.",

It examines the initial secularizing tendencies of the post-independence regimes, the subsequent re-integration of Islam into the state's discourse of legitimacy, the emergence of Islamist movements, and the state control over religious expression. \n\nRegarding Morocco, the text discusses the early years after independence (1956-1960), highlighting the Istiqlal party's attempt to establish a single version of Islam and their actions against Sufi brotherhoods and marabouts. It describes two key crises: the 'Qarawiyne crisis,' concerning the control and reform of the Qarawiyne University, and the 'Baha'i trial,' which revealed a secularist current within the government. The text details how King Mohammed V (and later Hassan II) used these crises to consolidate the monarchy's role as the protector of religious actors and to re-appropriate the religious discourse. It mentions the creation of the Rabita of Ulama and Hassan II's decree instituting the Qarawiyne University. \n\nThe text further explores the strategies employed by the Moroccan monarchy to control the religious sphere, including the marginalization of competing clerics through their integration into the public sector, the maintenance of a plurality of religious currents (while controlling them), and the reinterpretation of Islam to sacralize the regime. It discusses the rehabilitation of the bey'a (oath of allegiance) and its integration into the political power structure.  The text also provides some comparative perspectives by examining the approaches to Islam and state relations in Algeria and Tunisia.",

It argues that the early nationalist movement drew its strength from the wealthy and educated segments of urban society. Key figures like Allal al-Fassi, Mohamed bel Hassan el Ouazzani, and Ahmed Balafrej came from families with long-standing urban traditions, wealth, and a monopoly on religious knowledge. Fès was the primary center of Moroccan nationalism, although other cities such as Rabat, Salé, and Tetouan also participated in the movement. The article further suggests that the shift of the Sultan's power to Rabat under the Protectorate led to frustration among the bourgeoisie of Fès, who gradually relocated to coastal cities like Casablanca. This, combined with the city's history of challenging authority, contributed to the rise of a youth movement steeped in both traditional and modern knowledge. Urban nationalism, originating in Fès, spread to other cities and social classes before reaching the rural population, who had already resisted the military conquest. The year 1934 marked the end of armed resistance and the beginning of political contestation, primarily in urban areas. The article states that it will analyze the composition, role, and place of the bourgeoisie in Moroccan society before and after 1912, including their behavior toward the French Protectorate, as well as the effects of the economic and moral crisis on Moroccan society.",

It contextualizes the Hirak within the long history of marginalization and repression experienced by the Rif population since Morocco's independence in 1956. The article touches upon the Istiqlal party's role and unpopularity in the Rif region after independence. The document states that the attempt by the government to unify the Rif with the rest of Morocco after independence disadvantaged the local elites, with important posts being filled by officials from other parts of Morocco and no Rifains represented in the national government. This led to anger directed at the Istiqlal party, which was in government at the time but had limited support in the Rif, and contributed to the Rif revolt of 1958.

Key events discussed include the capture of FLN leaders in 1956, the bombing of Sakiet-Sidi-Youssef in 1958, and the Conference of Tangier in 1958. The text argues that Tunisia, under Bourguiba, played a crucial, albeit cautious, role in supporting the Algerian struggle while navigating its own path to independence and regional influence.

While it doesn't directly focus on the formation of the Istiqlal Party and the national campaign, it sets the context of political reforms and the role of the \"Mouvement National\" (the nationalist movement from which the Istiqlal party emerged) in advocating for these reforms after independence, thereby indirectly relating to the broader historical circumstances surrounding the party's formation and its goals.",

The article further discusses the core constitutional principles symbolized by \"God, the country, the King,\" which limit the scope of opposition. The Sahara issue is discussed, how there is a common consensus on it, and the king's role. It also delves into the ways in which the monarchy restricts the actions of other political players.

The review, born from collaboration between an anticolonial faction of the SFIO and the \"Young Moroccans\" movement, is presented as the precursor to the first nationalist political party, the Moroccan Action Committee (Comité d'action marocaine), founded in December 1934. Furthermore, the article discusses *L'Action du Peuple*, the first Moroccan francophone weekly created in Fez on August 4, 1933, by Mohamed Hassan Ouazzani, and highlights the close connection between these two publications within the framework of the Maghrebi nationalist network. The interdiction of both *Maghreb* and *L'Action du Peuple* in May 1934 is seen as a symbol of the transition from rural tribal resistance to an urban political movement linked to Algerian and Tunisian counterparts.",

It analyzes the concept of the \"État profond\" (deep state) in Moroccan politics, examining conflicts and tensions between the government and various actors, including media outlets (2M), the Haut-commissariat au Plan (HCP), NGOs, and syndicates. The article touches on the opposition faced by Benkirane, both internal and external, within the context of the Mouvement du 20 Février and the new constitution. The Istiqlal party is specifically mentioned as being part of the opposition facing Benkirane, though this is situated in 2014 and concerns leadership challenges to the government, not the party's initial formation during the national movement. The article describes Hamid Chabat's leadership within the Istiqlal party.

It analyzes the historical context of education in Morocco, detailing the coexistence of traditional Arabo-Islamic education, French colonial education, and the emergence of 'free schools' or renovated Arab education led by Moroccan nationalists. The document explores the challenges of unifying these disparate systems post-independence, with a focus on arabization, marocanization (staffing by Moroccans), and general access to education. It delves into the specifics of the Moroccan education system post-independence including the structure of primary, secondary, and higher education; budgetary allocations; infrastructure development; and the training of teaching staff.  It further examines the issues of unequal access to education, particularly in rural areas, and the problems of student attrition, and the economic and social consequences of these educational policies. It discusses the challenges of Arabization, the reliance on French cooperation, and political interference in education. It touches upon political dynamics of the time as different political groups had varying positions on educational changes. Although the document does not explicitly mention the formation of the Istiqlal party and the national campaign, it indirectly links to the historical context that influenced these movements. Namely, the document explains the educational landscape that Moroccan nationalists faced and aimed to reform through establishing \"free schools\". These schools embody the essence of the national campaign aimed at promoting Arab culture and identity in response to foreign influence, which were key goals of the Istiqlal party and the national campaign (الحملة الوطنية).",

The study looks at different types of associations (cultural, human rights, youth, women, consumers, environmental, and religious) and how they contribute to the country's social, cultural, and political spheres.

It discusses the various individuals and groups, sometimes referred to as the \"Moroccan lobby\" or \"camarilla,\" who exerted influence on French policy in Morocco. The article aims to identify these actors and analyze their impact on the Sultan's deposition. It also outlines the organizations that constituted the colonial party during the Third Republic, including the Comité de l'Afrique française (founded in 1890) and its offshoot, the Comité du Maroc (founded in 1904), as well as the Union Coloniale and the Ligue Maritime et Coloniale. The article also mentions figures like Jules Charles-Roux, a deputy from Marseille and leader within these committees. The text identifies key figures who were considered part of the 'Moroccan lobby' that influenced Laniel, including General Bethouart, François Charles-Roux, André Bougenot, and Robert Montagne. It also lists members of the 'camarilla' in Rabat as Marcel Vallat, Philippe Boniface, Colonels Lecomte and Olié, de Blesson, and Gustave Aucouturier. Other figures cited as partisans of Ben ‘Arafat include Maréchal Juin, Marcel Boussac, Generals Bethouart and Lecomte, and President Émile Roche.",

The Istiqlal party, along with Allal el Fassi's ideas about the \"Grand Morocco,\" fueled the AL's actions in the Sahara, leading to attacks in northern Mauritania starting in 1957. This pressure from Morocco and internal political divisions led Mokhtar Ould Daddah to advocate for a united front, resulting in the formation of the Parti du regroupement mauritanien (PRM) in 1958.

The text highlights the network of intermediaries established by the Ministry of the Interior after 1960 to secure political support from the countryside. It also examines the delicate balance the monarchy faced between satisfying the demands of the rural population and promoting economic modernization, noting the potential risks of alienating either the traditional elites or the growing rural population migrating to urban areas. While the text doesn't directly address the formation of the Istiqlal Party or the national campaign explicitly, the discussion of political dynamics and the monarchy's engagement with the rural population and other political forces in the post-independence era provides relevant context for understanding the broader political landscape in which the party operated and the national campaign occurred.",

It points to the importance of the PJD (Parti de la justice et du développement) in Morocco as a source of democratic hope. The document discusses the need to overcome the fear of Islamist parties and promote cooperation and integration based on democracy. It also touches on the importance of regional integration and its potential impact on economic growth and investment and mentions the low voter turnout in elections in Algeria and Morocco due to mistrust in the ruling elites.

While it doesn't directly address the formation of the Istiqlal Party or the national campaign, it provides valuable context regarding the political landscape, the role of political parties, and the dynamics between the monarchy and the government during a crisis, making it indirectly relevant. Specifically, the article discusses the limited role and influence of political parties within the Moroccan political system, a theme relevant to understanding the environment in which the Istiqlal Party operated. It also touches upon the internal divisions within the PJD and the challenges faced by political actors in influencing policy, which could indirectly shed light on the political climate relevant to the activities of other political parties.",

It highlights the different political meanings that elections acquired after the 2011 revolutions in North African countries. The study analyzes electoral processes in Morocco, Tunisia, and Egypt starting from 2011, focusing on the recurring patterns in voting territories, such as the urban-rural divide and the North-South divide. The article also underscores that these patterns are influenced by different factors, including national and regional political contexts, and that the religious versus secular divide is central to party system recompositions, with the rise of Islamist movements linked to low participation and the difficulty of modernist forces in organizing themselves effectively.",

Les cas de l'Égypte et du Maroc\" by Jean-Noël Ferrié, published in 2012, analyzes the evolution of authoritarian regimes in Egypt and Morocco, particularly in the context of the Arab Spring. While not directly focusing on the formation of the Istiqlal party or the national campaign, it provides crucial context for understanding the political landscape in Morocco post-independence, the challenges to authoritarianism, and the dynamics of political reform. The article discusses the Istiqlal party's role after independence and the monarchy's efforts to reduce its influence, which provides relevant background for understanding the context surrounding the formation of other political entities and national movements. The analysis of the Moroccan monarchy's strategies of co-opting opposition and managing political change provides insight into the broader political environment within which the Istiqlal party operated and the evolution of Moroccan nationalism.",

It details the socio-political context, the debates between traditionalists and modernists, and the challenges in implementing the reformed code. The article highlights the roles of King Hassan II and King Mohammed VI, the influence of Islamic law (Sharia and Fiqh), and the impact of these reforms on Moroccan women and society. It covers the evolution of women's rights, the role of the Union de l'Action Féminine (UAF), and the involvement of various political parties, including the Istiqlal Party, in the debates surrounding the Moudawana. The article further examines the resistance from traditionalists, the challenges faced by the Moroccan judicial system in adapting to the new code, and the limited success in disseminating information about the reforms to the wider population.",

            "Starting in 1965, voices rose to reform the Moudawana, deemed unsuited to modern Moroccan society.",
            "In 1993, Hassan II reformed the Moudawana by royal decree, allowing wives to gain custody of children and making polygamy and repudiation more difficult.",
            "The 1993 reforms were criticized by both Islamists and feminist organizations.",
            "In 1999, after Hassan II's death, debate around the Moudawana intensified under Mohammed VI.",
            "On October 10, 2004, Mohammed VI presented a new family code that was adopted in December of the same year.",
            "The 2004 Moudawana raised the minimum marriage age for girls to 18, placed family responsibility on both spouses, and made polygamy nearly impossible.",
            "The 2004 reform was the result of six years of ideological clashes between traditionalists and reformers.",

It explores how the Moroccan state, despite its constitutionally defined Islamic identity, is undergoing a process of secularization. The article discusses the role of the monarchy in managing religious symbolism, the secularization of civil society and political actors (including the PJD), and the PJD's own adaptation from a radical Islamist movement to a participant in the political system. It examines the PJD's shift from religious discourse to political discourse, its stance on issues like the freedom of belief, and its engagement with the concept of secularity. The article also touches on the Istiqlal party's role in constitutionalizing the title of 'Commander of the Believers'. The analysis relies on observations, interviews with PJD members, and references to relevant legal and political documents.",
          "extracted_key_facts": [
            "The Moroccan constitution (1996) declares Islam as the state religion, with the king holding the title of 'Commander of the Believers'.",

            "The Istiqlal party played a key role in constitutionalizing the title of 'Commander of the Believers' after independence, due to Mohamed V's resistance to French colonialism.",
            "In the 1960s, the monarchy used its religious authority to counter a left-wing movement, and in the 1980s, to counter Islamist movements.",
            "Hassan II recognized 'the fundamentalism of the State' and declared himself a fundamentalist in 1986.",
            "Mohammed VI reaffirmed his role as the legitimate authority concentrating political and religious powers after the Casablanca bombings in 2003.",
            "The law on political parties in 2006 prohibits parties that undermine Islam.",
            "The PJD emerged from a radical Islamist movement in the 1970s, initially advocating for an Islamic state.",
            "The PJD obtained seats in Parliament in 1997, leading to a separation of political and religious activity.",
            "The PJD's electoral programs emphasize democracy, local governance, and social and economic development, with a reduced emphasis on religious themes.",
            "The PJD's statutes do not explicitly reference Islam, focusing on citizen engagement and democratic choice within the framework of the kingdom's Islamic identity.",
            "Interviews with PJD members between 2006 and 2010 suggest that the party has marginalized religious themes in favor of political mobilization.",
            "The PJD, while tolerating a form of secularization, opposes a complete separation of the spiritual and temporal.",
            "Some PJD leaders in July 2011 reportedly pressured the constitutional revision committee to not include 'freedom of belief' in the reformed constitution, threatening to call for a vote against it."

The article discusses the political climate following the 'Arab Spring,' the PJD's governance in coalition with other parties, the role of the Monarchy, and the electoral campaigns of the PJD and its main rival, the Party of Authenticity and Modernity (PAM). It examines factors such as electoral participation, demographic representation, and the influence of various political actors, ultimately analyzing the election results and the subsequent challenges in forming a government.

Specifically, the text mentions the Istiqlal Party's performance in the 2002 elections (securing 48 seats), highlighting its position as one of the major traditional parties alongside the USFP.

The paper details the political and electoral reforms sought by the PJD, their relationship with the monarchy (majzen), and their views on the role of Islam in Moroccan society and law.

It discusses the evolution of the Moroccan electoral landscape since the 1960s, from direct administrative intervention to a more competitive, though still controlled, system. The paper examines the role of political parties (including the Istiqlal party, though not focusing on its formation), the influence of the monarchy, electoral reforms, and the impact of these factors on voter participation and candidate selection in Dakhla (Western Sahara). It covers aspects such as over-representation of Sahrawi voters, the rise of 'notables' in politics, nomadism of political figures between parties, vote-buying, and the administration's evolving methods of control, including subtle exclusion of certain candidates. It also describes the relationship between the central government and opposition parties, and the shift in power dynamics after 1998 when opposition parties joined the government. Though not directly about the *formation* of Istiqlal or the *national campaign*, it discusses its role in later elections and the broader political context.",

The article also analyzes the development of civil society in Morocco, the effects of structural adjustment programs, and the challenges to governance during the double transition (economic liberalization and political pluralism). It argues that the liberalization process, while initiated as a legitimization strategy by the monarchy, has unleashed social mobilization with the potential for democratic consolidation. The article explores the dynamics of power between the monarchy, political parties (including the Istiqlal party), and civil society, focusing on themes of governance, state legitimacy, and the impact of economic policies on social structures.

The study describes the Moroccan party system, considering the origin and nature of its multi-party system, the transformations since independence, and its current structure based on the cleavages in Moroccan society.

It outlines the complex history of Morocco's relations with Africa, highlighting territorial disputes, ideological positioning during the Cold War, and its involvement in African liberation movements. The document notes the role of the Istiqlal party in the Bandung Conference in 1955, but also mentions the government's absence from the Afro-Asian Conference in Cairo in 1957. It details Morocco's support for the Conference of Accra in 1958 and the subsequent formation of the Casablanca Group under the influence of Mehdi Ben Barka, a former Istiqlal leader. The text also explores the motives behind Morocco's renewed focus on Africa, including the Western Sahara issue, re-entry into the African Union, security concerns, immigration, and the expansion of Moroccan businesses and investments. This includes analysis of King Mohammed VI's diplomatic tours in Africa. The source also outlines Morocco's alternative approach to maintaining presence in Africa through the creation of the Moroccan Agency for International Cooperation (AMCI) in 1986. It describes Morocco's involvement in UN peacekeeping missions. Ultimately, the article is about Morocco's foreign policy towards Africa and the factors influencing it in the modern era.",

It examines the implementation of quota systems designed to increase youth representation, and the impact of these measures on the overall political landscape. The study also explores the historical trends in the composition of the Moroccan parliament, including demographic shifts, renewal rates, and socio-professional profiles of parliamentarians from 1977 to 2016. It argues that the adoption of youth quotas is driven more by a desire to renew the political class and adapt to changing social dynamics than by a genuine commitment to democratic values or improved representation. The paper suggests that despite increasing youth representation, the Moroccan parliament continues to hold marginal power within the political system, where the monarchy retains executive authority. The Istiqlal party is briefly mentioned regarding its youth wing.",
          "extracted_key_facts": [
            "Since 2011, Morocco has implemented positive discrimination measures to promote youth representation in the Chamber of Representatives, reserving 30 seats for individuals under 40.",

            "The \"Arab Spring\" protests of 2010-2011, led in part by the \"February 20 Movement,\" prompted calls for greater youth inclusion in Moroccan politics.",
            "In August 2011, youth representatives from various parties met with the Moroccan Minister of Interior to advocate for increased parliamentary representation.",
            "As a prelude to the November 25, 2011 elections, the Ministry of Interior adopted 30 reserved seats for individuals under 40, seen as a gesture to gain youth support and project political change.",
            "The monarchy, in a speech on August 20, 2011, emphasized the importance of youth inclusion to bring \"new blood\" into politics.",
            "Interviews with political party members highlighted the need to \"renew and rejuvenate\" the parliament and the political class.",
            "The study finds that the proportion of deputies under 35 years old has drastically decreased since 1977 until 1993, with a slight increase after the introduction of quotas in 2011.",
            "Data from 1977 to 2016 shows the Chamber of Representatives has seen high renewal rates, with 60-70% of deputies being new faces after each election.",
            "While the socio-professional categories of deputies have varied over the years, key groups include professors, civil servants, farmers, liberal professions, and traders/businessmen.",
            "Only three deputies from the 2011 youth lists were re-elected in local constituencies in the 2016 legislative elections.",
            "The Istiqlal party is mentioned as having members of its youth wing interviewed during the research."

While the primary focus isn't the formation of the Istiqlal party and the national campaign in Morocco directly, it provides crucial context by discussing Moroccan political dynamics, nationalisms, and regional aspirations in the pre- and post-independence periods, which influenced the broader political landscape within which the Istiqlal party operated. It examines the challenges to regional integration, including divergent regimes, local nationalisms, contradictory industrialization models, and political hegemony issues like the Western Sahara conflict. It also touches upon the rise of fundamentalism as a major obstacle to the UMA and analyzes the economic disparities among the Maghreb countries. It discusses the historical context of Moroccan independence and political maneuvering which were key to understanding the environment in which the Istiqlal party was created and operated.",

It provides details about the magazine's origins in 1945 within the Grupo de Tiradores de Ifni, its evolution, financial dependence on the colonial administration, readership targeted towards the peninsular and Canary Island population, and its role as a propaganda tool for the Franco regime. The paper focuses on the magazine's coverage of the Ifni War (1957-1958), its silence surrounding the retrocession of Ifni to Morocco in 1969, and its overall discourse, which emphasized the civilizing mission of Spain while downplaying Moroccan claims and the influence of the Istiqlal party. The paper also details the magazine's counter-propaganda efforts against Moroccan media, its internal structure, and its ultimate failure to adapt to changing political realities, leading to its discontinuation. It also describes the Francoist regime's efforts to develop media in Ifni and Sahara to counter the Istiqlal party's expansionist ideas. The analysis reveals the magazine's role in promoting a pro-Spanish narrative and its selective reporting, designed to maintain the status quo of Spanish colonial rule.",

The paper argues that while these policies have benefited the elite, they have also led to increased inequality and discontent, potentially destabilizing the country and creating challenges for European security. It highlights the king's strategy of offering policy concessions and actively co-opting potential challengers by granting them access to state resources, expanding on the approaches of previous Moroccan kings, Mohamed V and Hassan II. The study details the mechanisms of economic co-optation, including privatization, public-private partnerships, and bureaucratic duplicity, which have allowed the monarchy and its associates to accumulate wealth and maintain control. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of this system for social and political stability in Morocco and suggests that the EU should push for genuine democratic reforms and respect for human rights.",

            "Mohamed V used rent channels to reward loyalist rural elites for their support during his struggle with nationalists.",

            "In 1946, Ifni and the Western Sahara were integrated into a single political and military entity: the Spanish West Africa (AOE).",

            "The Spanish Armada recommended delaying any attack until sufficient transport and landing resources were available and began mobilizing merchant ships and seeking amphibious assistance from the US and French navies.",
            "The plan involved two Spanish motorized columns departing from Villa Bens and El Aaiún to clear the Saguia El Hamra, converging at Smara with French forces and a paratrooper drop.",

The source directly addresses the Moroccan Istiqlal party's claims to Ifni and the actions of the 'Army of Liberation' (Yeicht Taharir), composed of Istiqlal activists and former combatants against the French, who initiated hostilities against Spanish interests in Ifni, relating to the 'national campaign' aspect of the provided event.",

The thesis analyzes continuities and ruptures in the socio-economic and political role of this elite. A key focus is the colonial legacy and the \"question of the north,\" exploring how colonial division contributed to feelings of marginalization leading to the idea of refounding the Hizb Al-Islah Al-Watani (Party of National Reform). The abstract notes that this party, the first nationalist organization recognized by colonial authorities in Morocco (December 1936), played a crucial role in shaping the Moroccan nationalist movement. However, post-colonially, the idea of refounding it was linked to regionalist and localist concerns due to the marginalization of northern Morocco.",

This chapter is directly relevant to Moroccan history and potentially to the dynamics surrounding the formation of the Istiqlal Party and the national campaign (الحملة الوطنية), given the significance of Berber identity and its relationship to Moroccan nationalism and the political landscape during the period of the Istiqlal Party's emergence. The book is a collection of essays dealing with minority issues in the Mediterranean region.

It discusses the complexities of studying this region due to colonial legacies, the different social orders and territories within the Western Sahara, and the ongoing conflict surrounding the Western Sahara. It acknowledges the colonial impact and the resilience of the region's inhabitants. The document explores the concept of 'coloniality' in the region, and its impact on the Sahrawi populations. It also mentions the role of the Istiqlal party in relation to the 'Greater Morocco' project and Mauritanian independence. The source emphasizes the importance of considering diverse perspectives and interdisciplinary approaches to understand the historical and socio-cultural context of political actions in the Western Sahara. The text also details the different types of movements and mobilizations, like the Green March. Finally it touches on how resistance movements and nationalistic endeavors were sparked by figures like Bassiri.",

While the primary focus is on the 2007 elections, the text frequently mentions the Istiqlal party in relation to the elections and the political landscape. It notes the party's historical significance as a nationalist party, its role within the Kutla, its performance in past elections (including 2002), its participation in the government of alternance, its campaign promises (specifically regarding employment), and its interactions with other political forces like the USFP and the PJD. The analysis includes discussions on voter participation, electoral census issues, the influence of rural populations, and the role of Islamism in Moroccan politics. The analysis covers pre-election promises related to employment, candidate selections, the role of Fuad Ali El Himma, the female quota, and the balance of power, providing a detailed view of the political dynamics and the Istiqlal party's position within those dynamics.",

            "The Istiqlal party (PI) is described as the old nationalist party of independence and the second most voted party in 2002 with 9.88% of the votes.",

            "In the pre-election period of 2007, the Istiqlal party promised to provide work for 1,300,000 Moroccans, prioritizing employment during the 2007-2012 legislative period.",
            "The Istiqlal party aimed for an average annual economic development of 6% without considering the agricultural sector and promised a reduction of unemployment from 10% to 7% by 2012.",
            "The USFP and the Istiqlal Party were members of the Kutla democrática.",
            "The Istiqlal party contested the 2007 elections, presenting candidates and programs.",
            "The Istiqlal party's historical role and standing within the Moroccan political system are contrasted with newer political entities.",
            "The Istiqlal party's campaign focused on employment and economic development.",

            "The Istiqlal party is described as surpassing the PJD in number of seats, although potentially not in number of votes during the 2007 elections.",
            "The article suggests that the Istiqlal party may have had an advantage due to quirks in the electoral system and district design during the 2007 election.",

It covers key events like the capture of Melilla (1497), the Spanish protectorate in Morocco (established formally in 1912 after the Treaty of Fez and the Madrid Treaty), the Rif War (1921-1927), the Ifni War (late 1950s), and the Green March (1975). It discusses Moroccan independence in 1956 and the subsequent disputes over territories like Tarfaya, Sidi Ifni and the Western Sahara. The text also touches on the formation of the Frente Polisario and its impact on the political landscape, focusing on the struggle for the independence of Western Sahara, and the various conflicts and agreements between Spain and Morocco regarding fishing rights, territorial claims, and migration. The analysis extends to the Perejil Island crisis in 2002, highlighting the ongoing tensions and territorial disputes between the two countries. The document also mentions the rise of Moroccan independence movements in the 1930s and 1940s, fueled by Istiqlal and supported by the Arab world, leading to the exile and later return of King Mohamed V. The text emphasizes the interwoven relationship between the colonial history of Spain in Morocco and the rise of Moroccan nationalism and independence movements. It concludes by reflecting on the complex dynamics of the current relationship, highlighting both cooperation and unresolved issues.",
