It analyzes the role of the UN Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO), established in 1991, and seeks to identify the key moments in the preceding decade that led to the resumption of armed hostilities and the intensification of the political impasse over Western Sahara and its people's right to self-determination.

It explores the origins, ideologies, and methods of action of both movements, highlighting their similarities and differences. The Polisario Front, seeking the creation of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic since 1976, is portrayed as a movement involved in violence, misappropriation of humanitarian aid, and potential links to organized crime in the Sahel. The Ambazonian movement, seeking independence for English-speaking Cameroon, is characterized by widespread violence, atrocities committed by various armed groups, and the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people. The article examines the geopolitical challenges posed by these separatist movements and the need for regional security. It discusses Morocco's autonomy proposal for the Sahara region and Cameroon's efforts to address the Anglophone crisis, ultimately arguing that both movements pose a threat to internal and external peace. It also touches upon UN Security Council Resolution 690 (1991) and the MINURSO mission's role in limiting Polisario's violence, and notes the OAU's 1984 admission of the SADR which led to Morocco leaving the OAU. The source concludes that the international community has not endorsed separatism in Cameroon, but has called for a peaceful resolution respecting Cameroon's unity.",

It argues that international law developments since 1975, particularly concerning state responsibility and racial discrimination, have significant implications for the status of Polisario and the potential resolution of the conflict. The brief suggests that Algeria's role as a full-fledged party to the conflict, due to its control over Polisario, should be acknowledged. It also critiques Polisario's persistent advocacy for a referendum based on national or ethnic origin, arguing that this would violate jus cogens norms prohibiting racial discrimination. Furthermore, the brief advocates for the Moroccan Autonomy Initiative as a viable framework for a balanced and inclusive resolution, emphasizing the need for all inhabitants of the Saharan provinces to exercise the right to self-determination without discrimination. The document references the UN-led peace process, MINURSO, ceasefire agreements, and various peace proposals. It also covers the growing international support for the Moroccan Autonomy Initiative and questions the legitimacy of Polisario as a representative of \"the people of Western Sahara\". The document emphasizes the importance of a lasting and fair resolution, achieved through adherence to international law, to prevent a relapse of conflict. The paper argues that a reassessment of the role of Algeria and Polisario is warranted in the UN-led peace process. It suggests that the Sahara issue could be considered a domestic issue if Algeria continues to deny its role. Ultimately, the policy brief proposes that the international framework should facilitate the external activities of various non-state actors seeking self-determination.",

It highlights the UN-sponsored ceasefire agreement of September 1991 between Morocco and POLISARIO, intended to pave the way for a referendum of self-determination in early 1992. It also details the reasons why the referendum was never held, focusing on disagreements over voter eligibility and various failed attempts by the UN to mediate a resolution. It analyzes the international support received by both parties, especially Morocco's backing from the United States and France, which has enabled it to maintain its position and block UN action. The paper also considers the internal dynamics of Saharawi nationalism and Morocco's claim to sovereignty. It also discusses Algeria's support to POLISARIO. Finally, it touches upon James Baker's framework agreement and peace plan. The paper concludes that the diplomatic stalemate continues because of the unresolved sovereignty claims, the reluctance of both parties to reach an agreement and UN Security Council's unwillingness to take measures to enforce one, and suggests a re-evaluation of international policies.",

The paper contends that Western Sahara is not geographically separate from Morocco, that the meaning of 'consent' in collective decisions should be differentiated from consensus, and that the Polisario is not the sole representative of the people of Western Sahara.

It uses the Polisario Front as a case study, employing original data on twelve years of diplomatic visits and analyzing the Polisario case through interviews with foreign ministry representatives. The article argues that these governments allocate significant resources to maintain a constant presence in third-party states, employ these resources strategically based on the characteristics of those states, and that their diplomatic reach depends on the types of appeals they make. The article includes mentions of the Polisario Front's establishment in 1973, the establishment of the Sahrawi Republic in 1976 in refugee camps in Tindouf, Algeria, and the USA's official recognition of Moroccan sovereignty over the territory in 2020 during the Trump Administration.",

The paper discusses the Moroccan occupation of most of Western Sahara, the presence of Saharawi refugees in Tindouf camps in Algeria, and the existence of the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic and the Polisario Front, which has resisted Moroccan occupation.

It argues that the term is often misused for political purposes by Polisario to undermine Morocco's sovereignty over natural resources. The paper references the 1991 ceasefire agreement between Morocco and Polisario, monitored by MINURSO, as a reason why the term 'occupation' is not applicable. It also discusses UN General Assembly resolutions from 1979 and 1980 that used the term 'occupation', linking it to the peace agreement between Mauritania and Polisario. The paper analyzes the regret expressed by former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for using the term and examines the use of the term in British, EU, and South African court decisions. It concludes that a political solution based on compromise, such as Morocco's Autonomy Initiative, is the best way to promote the well-being of the residents in the Saharan Provinces, rather than the continued use of the term 'occupation'.",

It examines the democratisation agenda of Western governments in North Africa in relation to their \"Realpolitik\" approach to the Western Sahara conflict.

The article provides background information on the Western Sahara's status as a \"non-self-governing\" territory according to the UN since 1963, Spain's withdrawal in 1975, Morocco's subsequent annexation, and the ensuing 16 years of war. It details the de facto border established after the cease-fire, with Morocco controlling two-thirds of the territory and the Polisario Front controlling the remaining third, referred to as the \"free zone.\" The author describes a visit to the \"free zone,\" emphasizing its remoteness and the challenges of navigating the terrain. The article mentions that the informal border, marked by a 1,600-mile-long Moroccan-built sand berm, has generally been respected since 1991.

It discusses the history of the Western Sahara conflict, the role of the UN, particularly MINURSO, and the challenges to achieving a lasting peace. It mentions that in 1988 all conflicting parties agreed to the Settlement Plan made by Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar and the Organization of the African Unity’s (OAU) Chairman Kenneth Kaunda, and the Implementation Plan that complemented it. UNSC Resolution 690 approved the establishment of a UN peacekeeping force on April 29, 1991. MINURSO was set up to monitor the ceasefire between the Polisario Front and Morocco and to organize a referendum on self-determination for the Sahrawi people. The review highlights MINURSO's mandate, which includes monitoring the ceasefire, verifying troop reductions, ensuring the release of political prisoners, overseeing prisoner exchanges, repatriating refugees, identifying eligible voters, and organizing a free and fair referendum. It also discusses the challenges MINURSO has faced, including obstructionism, accusations of bias, diplomatic scandals, and the lack of a human rights mandate. The review notes that MINURSO prevented war recurrence for 30 years and refers to the collapse of one of the most durable UN ceasefires in November 2020.",

The ceasefire allowed refugees renewed access to territories, which created conditions for the re-development of productive activities, trade and the emergence of an informal economy in the refugee camps. This led to some refugees regaining access to camels and resuming camel husbandry. This process revitalized traditional knowledge associated with camels and the material and cultural bonds between refugees and their homeland. The camel was re-appropriated as a symbol of cultural identity, and camel products were deployed in nationalistic discourse. The paper analyzes the refugees' agency in recovering camel husbandry, the conditions that permitted this process, and the changes in camel husbandry that are emerging. It covers the historical background, the loss of herds during the war, the economic activities within the camps since 1991, the access to capital, the different types of camel husbandry, the access to liberated territories, and the camel's significance in Sahrawi identity and in the political struggle against Morocco.",

It details how the Sahrawi, displaced in 1975, lost their herds and became dependent on foreign aid in refugee camps in Algeria. With the ceasefire, they regained access to some nomadic territory, along with capital inflows, leading to the re-emergence of camel husbandry. The article examines the factors enabling this recovery, including renewed territorial access, demobilization of Polisario troops, increased access to cash, and the revitalization of traditional knowledge. It also analyzes the contemporary role of camels in Sahrawi cultural and political identity, highlighting the Polisario's efforts to assert national sovereignty and reclaim their nomadic heritage. The article notes that economic activity increased greatly since the UN-sponsored ceasefire agreement was signed with Morocco in 1991.",

The development of the conflict, the construction of the Sand Wall, and the international recognition of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) are mentioned. The paper extensively covers the 1991 ceasefire agreement and the establishment of MINURSO. It also details the failed referendum negotiations, including the Baker Plans I and II.

A significant portion focuses on the ceasefire agreement (اتفاق وقف إطلاق النار) brokered by the UN in 1990 between Morocco and Polisario and the subsequent efforts to organize a referendum. The paper evaluates the UN's intervention, the concept of ripeness in conflict resolution, and third-party motives for intervention, ultimately arguing that MINURSO was effective in maintaining the ceasefire and preserving the existing stalemate, aligning with the Security Council's tacit goals. The document provides a detailed analysis of the factors contributing to the conflict's persistence and the unpromising future for resolution.

It details the historical context, including the Spanish withdrawal in 1975, the subsequent occupation by Morocco and Mauritania, and the Polisario's armed resistance until the 1991 ceasefire. The document highlights the UN's involvement, particularly the establishment of MINURSO and the failed attempts to hold a referendum on self-determination. It also explores the reasons behind the shift towards negotiations as an alternative to the referendum and examines potential scenarios for resolving the conflict, including no dialogue, a referendum, economic cooperation, and mutual recognition. The document underscores the importance of adhering to international law, respecting the Saharawi people's right to self-determination, and addressing issues such as the exploitation of natural resources and the transfer of Moroccan settlers to Western Sahara. Crucially, it directly mentions the 1990 ceasefire agreement and the subsequent UN involvement (MINURSO), directly related to the sought agreement.",

It details the history of the conflict, the implementation and actions of MINURSO, and the economic, strategic, and geopolitical interests of the actors involved. The article argues that the conflict began in 1976 after the Madrid Agreement, disregarding the principle of self-determination. External actors like Spain, France, and the United States have contributed to the impasse due to their economic and strategic interests in maintaining good relations with Morocco. The UN's diplomacy, specifically MINURSO, has been limited by the influence of these external players. While MINURSO's military component has had some positive impacts by monitoring the ceasefire (اتفاق وقف إطلاق النار) and reducing threats from mines, it has been unable to implement the self-determination referendum. The article concludes that economic, strategic, and geopolitical interests continue to outweigh the respect for the principle of self-determination, hindering a resolution to the conflict.

It highlights the UN's involvement, including the establishment of MINURSO in 1991 to oversee a cease-fire and referendum. The timeline also covers failed attempts to hold a referendum, the Sahrawi Intifadas, human rights violations, and ongoing diplomatic efforts. Specifically, it notes the agreement on the OAU-UN Settlement Plan in 1988, which envisioned a cease-fire and a referendum, and the actual cease-fire in 1991 brokered by the UN, leading to the establishment of MINURSO to oversee the truce and prepare for a referendum initially scheduled for 1992. The source explains the failure of the referendum to materialize due to Moroccan opposition and conflicts over voter eligibility.",

The article examines the political origins and operational trials of MINURSO, highlighting the limitations of peacekeeping in the face of nationalism and international indifference. It suggests that poor planning and insufficient support can undermine peacekeeping operations and threaten UN credibility. It touches upon the implementation of cease-fires and political settlements between conflicting states and groups within states, including efforts to disengage belligerents. It also provides background on the evolution of peacekeeping as an alternative to collective security and notes that peacekeeping efforts have increasingly focused on conflicts within states, involving multinational military missions to maintain peace.

It traces the history of the conflict from the Spanish decolonization to the establishment of MINURSO. The article argues that the UN's involvement exhibits 'organized hypocrisy' through symbolic talk decoupled from action (regarding the referendum), dysfunctional promises of reform, and subcontracting regional organizations (the AU) without achieving a resolution. The cease-fire agreement of September 6, 1991, between Polisario and Moroccan authorities, is mentioned as the basis for the establishment of MINURSO. The article criticizes the UN's failure to enforce the self-determination referendum and its tendency to manage the conflict without resolving it. It also discusses the AU's limited role and Morocco's actions to maintain the status quo. The article concludes that the UN's approach, while maintaining a semblance of legitimacy, has ultimately perpetuated the deadlock and failed to provide a definitive solution, indicating 'globalized hypocrisy'.

The paper discusses the various settlement plans, including the UN–OAU Settlement Plan of 1990–91, which led to a ceasefire on September 6, 1991, and the subsequent Moroccan obstruction and breaches of these plans. It analyzes the roles of key international actors like Spain, France, the United States, and the UN Secretaries-General in shaping the peace process. The paper also covers the military aspects of the conflict and the strategic stalemate that ultimately led to the UN's mediation efforts. The paper emphasizes the Saharawi perspective, criticizing Morocco's actions and advocating for self-determination for the Saharaui people, while providing detailed narratives of the events leading up to and following the ceasefire agreement.",

It also mentions the extension of the UN peacekeeping mandate for Western Sahara in October 2019 for only six months. The article aims to ascertain the impact of the UN Peacekeeping mission and the underlying factors for its inability to resolve the conflict, examining the roles of Algeria and Morocco and foreign interests. It adopts the Liberal Peace Theory as its theoretical framework and emphasizes the need for the UN to proceed with the Settlement Plan's transitional and referendum phases and for major powers to avoid prioritizing their self-interests.",

The article also touches upon the Polisario v Council case concerning trade preferences.

MINURSO observes the ceasefire (since 1991) between Morocco and the Polisario Front. The briefing also mentions that the African Union's (AU) demands to upgrade MINURSO's mandate to include human rights monitoring were rejected, and instead, a resolution was passed calling for more intensive negotiations between Morocco and the Polisario Front. The report anticipates that Sahrawi activists, supported by Algeria, will initiate legal action against international companies cooperating with Morocco in Western Sahara and that diplomatic tensions between Morocco and Algeria will intensify.

The reference list includes multiple reports by the UN Secretary-General and other documents directly related to the situation in Western Sahara which would implicitly relate to ceasefire attempts and agreements. The encyclopedia entry mentions the contested status of Western Sahara after 1976, indicating that the conflict, and therefore the need for ceasefires, has persisted.",

The review discusses the book's insights into the Western Saharan liberation movement, the relationship between Sahrawi tribes and the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) and the Polisario Front. It mentions the withdrawal of Spain from the Spanish Sahara in 1974, the arrival of Morocco, and the rise of the Polisario to contest it. A significant portion describes the ceasefire declared in 1991 under UN urging between Spain and the SADR, and the subsequent attempts to organize a referendum, which ultimately failed due to disagreements over the voters' list. The review explores the evolution of the SADR, the changes within the refugee camps in Algeria, and the re-emergence of tribal structures. It also touches upon the compromises and conflicts related to governance, law, resources, inequalities, and the impact of markets on gender relations and commodities. The review frames the Sahrawi experience as a building of a governance experience and structure, evolving from a revolutionary war to a state-in-waiting.",

This characterization was seen as a departure from UN neutrality and led to Morocco requesting the withdrawal of MINURSO staff and threatening to withdraw from peacekeeping operations. The article highlights the historical context of the conflict, including Morocco's integration policy in the 'recovered provinces,' the Madrid Accords of 1975, and the challenges faced by MINURSO in fulfilling its mandate due to Moroccan obstructions. It also mentions the EU's annulment of the farming and fisheries agreement with Morocco and the hunger strike of Aminatou Haidar. The article concludes by emphasizing the urgency of a negotiated solution and the potential threat of Jihadist groups exploiting the conflict.",

It mentions the 1991 ceasefire agreement in Western Sahara, stating that the Polisario violates it. The article outlines the Polisario's history, its alleged links to terrorist groups, and its impact on regional stability. It argues that the Polisario, founded in Algeria in 1973, is a destabilizing militia involved in arms smuggling and aligns with Iran, Russia, and China. The piece advocates for the U.S. to designate the Polisario as an FTO, citing its violation of the 1991 ceasefire, diversion of humanitarian aid, collaboration with terrorist organizations, receipt of drones from Iran, and arms smuggling to jihadist insurgents. The article also notes the support Algeria provides to the Polisario due to its rivalry with Morocco and highlights President Trump's 2020 recognition of Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara. It points out the historical context of the Western Sahara dispute since Spain's withdrawal in 1975 and the Polisario's claim to fight for self-determination. The article concludes by emphasizing the strategic importance of Western Sahara and the need to counter the instability caused by the Polisario.",

The document references the 1991 ceasefire between Morocco and the Polisario Front, mentioning how it was supposed to lead to a referendum on self-determination, which never materialized. The paper details the context of the ceasefire with the establishment of a physical border in the form of a sand wall and the continued conflict between Morocco and the Polisario. The text also elaborates on the Moroccan government's policy of encouraging defections from the Polisario Front through various incentives, a policy that intensified after the ceasefire. Two poems are analyzed in the document that criticizes Sahrawis who rejoined Morocco. The document also touches on the use of poetry as a tool in the political discourse surrounding the Western Sahara conflict, including the efforts by both Morocco and the Polisario Front to influence public opinion and control mobility in the region.",

Specifically regarding a ceasefire, the document mentions that in September 1991, a ceasefire agreement was made which predicted the organization of a referendum in January 1992.

The article highlights Algeria's consistent support for the Polisario Front, stemming from its commitment to self-determination, and the US's evolving, often ambivalent, relationship with Morocco due to the conflict. It covers diplomatic efforts, including those involving UN envoys like James Baker, and how disagreements over the Sahara and Palestine influenced US-Algeria relations. The analysis includes the impact of the Trump administration's recognition of Moroccan sovereignty over the Sahara in exchange for Morocco's normalization of relations with Israel (Abraham Accords) and the resumption of hostilities in Guerguerat in November 2020. The document describes the 1991 cease-fire and the failed referendum attempts, as well as the ongoing military and diplomatic support to Morocco through joint military exercises like African Lion 21.",

Specifically, the document mentions Polisario attacks in Mauritanian territory (Nouakchott, Ouedane, Zouerate) in early July, engagements near Bir Lahlou and further attacks on Zouerate later in the month. It notes increased military cooperation between Morocco and Mauritania, including reorganization of the Mauritanian army command and the dispatch of Moroccan reinforcements to Zouerate. The chronology also covers Spanish diplomatic activity related to the Sahara and mediation attempts, and a Polisario press conference where prisoners were presented. These events are directly related to the conflict that preceded the ceasefire agreement.",

It mentions the 1991 ceasefire agreement between the Polisario Front and Morocco, noting that the agreement led to a relative improvement in the socio-political atmosphere within the camps and allowed for renewed regional mobility. The study explores the relationship between this increased mobility and the improvement of living conditions within the camps. Key themes include the socio-spatial organization of the refugee camps, the role of the Polisario Front and the RASD, and the cultural connections between the Sahrawi refugees and Mauritania. It emphasizes the unique characteristic of the Sahrawi refugee camps: their function as the temporary territory of the RASD, managed directly by the Sahrawi refugees through the RASD-Polisario. The thesis examines the spatial aspects of the refugee experience and investigates how mobility impacts their lives.",

It mentions that the referendum is no longer on MINURSO's agenda but the mission is confined to the observation role only. It discusses the ongoing negotiations and lack of progress on fundamental issues between the parties.

While it broadly covers border conflicts and secessionist movements across the continent, it specifically mentions the conflict in Western Sahara between Morocco and the Polisario Front, which is pertinent to the ceasefire agreement. The document outlines the historical claims of Morocco and the Polisario, the establishment of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR), and the ongoing dispute over self-determination. It also touches upon the involvement of Algeria and other African nations in the conflict and the failed attempts at a referendum. Furthermore, it notes that a ceasefire was envisioned in 1988 but has not yet occurred. Therefore, while the document's primary focus is broader, its specific coverage of the Western Sahara conflict makes it relevant to the specified event.",

It examines the factors contributing to this dissent, including the failure of the referendum on self-determination, the rise of social inequalities in refugee camps, and the impact of migration on Sahrawi society. The document also explores the complex relationship between these dissident groups, the Front Polisario, and the broader Sahrawi political landscape. Furthermore, it discusses the discourse surrounding the resumption of armed conflict as a means of expressing dissatisfaction with the Front Polisario's diplomatic approach. Ultimately, the article concludes that these dissenting voices, especially among the youth, represent a challenge to the Front Polisario's authority and introduce uncertainty into the future of the Western Sahara conflict. The article argues that the context of 'ni paix, ni guerre' after the 1991 ceasefire led to frustration and contributed to the rise of these movements.",

Several sections discuss the period after the pacification of the region, the role of internal borders, control of nomadic populations, and the French response to various forms of resistance. One chapter, 'Les confins algéro (mauritano) marocains: Une formule originale d’administration adaptée aux grands nomades', directly mentions the creation of a military command in 1934 to control nomadic groups, specifically the Reguibat, across Algerian, Mauritanian, and Moroccan borders. It also discusses events leading up to the independence of Morocco and the eventual formation of the Polisario Front and the involvement of Reguibat tribesmen. The text hints at the potential for lessons learned from this administrative structure to be applied to resolving the conflict between Morocco and the Sahrawis. Therefore, it provides background context related to the sociopolitical dynamics influencing the environment where \"اتفاق وقف إطلاق النار مع البوليساريو\" ultimately took place.",

It highlights Morocco's initiative presented in April 2007 and its gradual acceptance on the international stage, despite being rejected by Algeria and the Polisario. The paper emphasizes the support from the United States and France, with the US reiterating its position on April 8, 2025, urging the UN Envoy to work on the basis of the Moroccan autonomy initiative. The paper refers to the Polisario's violation of the ceasefire agreement. The paper also discusses the evolution of the autonomy concept since James Baker's initial proposal and the subsequent Moroccan autonomy initiative, which included provisions for local governance, but maintained Moroccan sovereignty. The paper mentions the US recognition of Moroccan sovereignty in 2020 and the need for a genuine autonomy to ensure a durable solution with a potential shift of MINURSO towards a political role to assist negotiation efforts. The paper calls upon the Polisario to renounce armed struggle and encourages Algeria to reestablish diplomatic ties with Morocco.",

Morocco advocates for autonomy within the kingdom, while the Polisario Front, supported by Algeria, seeks self-determination. The article references the 1991 ceasefire agreement and the failed attempts to hold a referendum on the territory's status due to disagreements over voter eligibility. It also explores different proposals, including the Baker Plan, which suggested a period of Sahrawi autonomy followed by a referendum. The article analyzes the complexities of implementing autonomy, considering the potential impact on Moroccan identity and the difficulty of defining who is a legitimate Sahrawi representative. It details the evolution of Morocco's position from initially supporting self-determination to later advocating for autonomy under Hassan II and Mohamed VI, and discusses how social and political changes in Morocco have influenced the Sahrawi population's identity and demands.

It mentions the 1991 ceasefire agreement between Morocco and the Polisario Front, the failed referendum planned for 1992, the unworkable Baker Plans I (2000) and II (2003), and fruitless informal negotiations. The brief analyzes the conflict's complexity, involving international law, geopolitics, economics, politics, and anthropology, as well as actors like Morocco, Algeria, the Polisario Front, Mauritania, Spain, France, and the United States. It criticizes the formalistic approach to international law, advocating for a more dynamic and critical approach that considers the social context and power dynamics. The author suggests that the Security Council should redefine the capital of legal legitimacy based on public international law, breaking with the 'winner takes all' logic and embracing equity. The brief proposes autonomy for the Sahara region as a durable and equitable solution, aligning with the Moroccan Autonomy Project, and guaranteeing the region's stability. It further notes the UN Security Council met on April 27, 2018, and asked the Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General of the UN for the Sahara, Horst Köhler, to continue discussions on a revival of negotiations between the parties. It concludes by urging Morocco and Algeria to reconcile to achieve a negotiated and equitable solution that guarantees the dignity of the Sahrawi components and Morocco's territorial integrity.",

While the primary focus is not directly on the ceasefire agreement itself, the text provides crucial context for understanding the conditions and social structures that emerged *after* the 1991 ceasefire with Morocco. It highlights the demographic imbalance resulting from the war, the shift in gender roles, and the increasing importance of women in managing daily life and preserving Sahrawi identity in the camps. It also touches upon the RASD's social reforms, the challenges women face, and the impact of international aid on their lives. The paper discusses economic and social changes, including new forms of dependence and the influence of those who migrate for work, all within the context of the unresolved conflict. The text indirectly sheds light on the post-ceasefire socio-political context and its effects on the Sahrawi population, especially women, in the refugee camps.",

The US position, consistent across different administrations since Donald Trump's initial recognition in December 2020, bolsters Morocco's approach, based on compromise, regional stability, and economic integration, while further isolating the Polisario Front. The document details the historical context of the US position, highlighting its alignment with US geopolitical interests, including countering Chinese influence and solidifying ties with Morocco. The brief also discusses Morocco's proactive diplomacy in garnering international support for its autonomy plan, noting the opening of consulates in Laayoune and Dakhla and the shifting positions of countries like Spain and France. It then explores the regional repercussions, including the reconfiguration of power dynamics in the Maghreb, Algeria's reaction, and the evolving UN Security Council resolutions. It touches upon the potential for security stabilization and the role of Morocco in countering extremism in the Sahel-Saharan region. Finally, it highlights the Royal Atlantic Initiative, positioning the Moroccan Sahara as a central hub for Afro-Atlantic integration, with projects like the Dakhla port and the Nigeria-Morocco gas pipeline.",

It analyzes the political dimension of memory, its construction, and its transmission, highlighting how the camps consolidate Sahrawi identity despite the passage of time and international migrations. The article examines the role of institutions, symbols, and narratives in shaping and maintaining the collective memory of the 'lost territory' and the desire for resistance among both older and newer generations of Sahrawi refugees. It covers the period from 1975, following the Madrid Accords and the Moroccan occupation of Western Sahara, through the establishment of the RASD (Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic) in the refugee camps in Algeria, up to the time of the research conducted between 2003 and 2008. It also describes the efforts of the Front Polisario to create a sense of national identity and cohesion among the Sahrawi people, emphasizing the importance of memory in ensuring the future independence of Western Sahara. The article touches on the ceasefire of 1991 organized by the UN as the starting point for a diplomatic deadlock, as well as the construction of defensive walls by Morocco starting in 1981, physically dividing the territory.",

It provides context on the conflict, referencing the 1988 and 1990 ceasefire agreements between Morocco and the Polisario Front, facilitated by the UN Secretary-General, Pérez de Cuéllar. It details the subsequent failure of referendum plans (Baker I and Baker II), and the Polisario's threat to resume armed conflict after Kofi Annan's 2006 report advocated direct negotiations, and lays out several scenarios regarding the future of the conflict, focusing on autonomy, continued negotiations, and the potential for international guarantees to improve the autonomy offer. The document suggests different options for Spain's involvement, including fully supporting Morocco's autonomy plan, advocating for autonomy as one option in a referendum, and conditioning support for autonomy on a democratic consultation and international guarantees. Finally, it offers recommendations to the Spanish government including strategies for engagement with the US, France, EU partners, Morocco, the Polisario Front, Algeria, Mauritania, the UN and relevant international organizations and NGOs.",

            "In 1988 and 1990, Morocco and the Polisario Front accepted a ceasefire and a settlement plan proposed by the UN Secretary-General, Pérez de Cuéllar, which included a referendum with the option of independence or integration with Morocco.",
            "The Houston Agreements (1997) aimed to unblock the electoral identification process and establish a code of conduct for the referendum.",
            "The Baker Plan I and Baker Plan II were supported by the Security Council until April 2004 but were not accepted by both parties; the Polisario Front accepted Baker II, while Morocco opposed it.",
            "In April 2006, Kofi Annan advocated for direct negotiations between the parties, a move rejected by Algeria and the Polisario Front, with the Polisario threatening to resume armed conflict.",

Regarding the Sahrawi cause, it mentions that the Polisario Front has struggled to gain international support, especially from Western powers due to its historical ties with Algeria and the Soviet Union. The blog post highlights that despite some countries recognizing the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, the lack of support from influential nations has limited its impact. The blog mentions the breakdown of the ceasefire and the need for the Polisario to re-evaluate its strategies. It notes the US recognition of Moroccan sovereignty over the Sahara in 2020. The blog post references the breaking of the decades-long ceasefire, indicating a return to conflict.",

The document argues that the deadlock in the conflict and the Sahrawi population's inability to achieve self-determination are due to the contradiction between international law and the geopolitical interests of various states. It suggests that international recognition of the RASD could offer a viable solution by overcoming obstacles such as the stalled referendum, the discredited role of the UN, and the interests of foreign powers like France and the United States. The chapter highlights that the resolution of the conflict hinges on whether international relations are based on the respect of international law or the interests of powerful states, questioning whether the right of conquest continues to dominate international relations.",

It discusses the historical context of the Western Sahara conflict, including Moroccan expansionism, the Polisario Front's emergence in 1973, and the establishment of refugee camps near Tindouf in Algeria following the withdrawal of Spain and the ensuing conflict. The text highlights the ceasefire agreement facilitated by the UN in 1991, but notes that despite the ceasefire, the situation of the Sahrawi refugees remains precarious. It further examines the UNHCR's role in providing humanitarian assistance and protection to the refugees, addressing issues such as forced displacement, human rights violations, and the challenges of implementing political measures to ensure their human security. The study concludes that the UNHCR's actions, while important, are insufficient to resolve the underlying issues, primarily the lack of resolution to the Western Sahara conflict and the continued displacement of the Sahrawi people, making the protection of human security a significant challenge for international agencies.",

The article highlights the 1991 ceasefire agreement between Morocco and the Polisario Front, which included a referendum supported by the African Union and the United Nations, leading to the establishment of MINURSO. It discusses Morocco's historical claims to the territory and its proposal for autonomy within Morocco. The study then analyzes the elements of statehood – territory, population, government, and recognition – in the context of Western Sahara. It also discusses UN resolutions, economic activities in the region (phosphate, iron, and oil), and the period of decolonization. It describes the consequences of the legal limbo, including refugee camps, displacement, and human rights violations, including the 1975 'Green March' and the 2010 Gdeim Izik protest.

It details the history of the conflict, starting with the Spanish withdrawal in 1975 and the subsequent invasion by Morocco, which led to a war with the Polisario Front. The document argues that Morocco's actions constitute an occupation under international law and highlights violations of jus ad bellum and jus in bello. Specifically, it mentions the armed conflict between the Polisario and Morocco from 1975-1991 and, referencing Moroccan communications with the ICRC, acknowledges a ceasefire of 1991, and the issue of prisoners of war following that ceasefire. The paper argues that Morocco has failed to adhere to international humanitarian law, and criticizes international bodies for not explicitly addressing the situation as an occupation. The article also covers demographic changes enacted by Morocco in the occupied territory and issues of human rights violations and war crimes perpetrated during the conflict.",

It details the UN's initial involvement through resolutions demanding decolonization from Spain, the establishment of MINURSO in 1991 to oversee a referendum, and the subsequent obstacles that prevented the referendum's execution. The text discusses the UN's efforts to mediate between Morocco and the Polisario Front, including the 1988 Settlement Plan and the 1991 ceasefire, laying the groundwork for the eventual peace process. The document explores the complexities of the conflict, the geopolitical interests of various parties, and the limitations of the UN's authority in resolving the dispute. It highlights key events like the Spanish withdrawal, the Green March, and the establishment of the RASD.

It details the support for Sahrawi self-determination by the UN General Assembly (UNGA) and the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the principle of respecting colonial-era borders, and other forms of support. It discusses the 1990 Settlement Plan (Plan de Arreglo) as a key agreement between Morocco and the Polisario Front, supported by the UN and the Organization of African Unity (OUA), aimed at a ceasefire and a referendum on self-determination. The document further elaborates on the gradual shift in the UN's approach towards integrating the Sahara into Morocco, highlighting initiatives like the Framework Agreement and the Peace Plan, and ultimately Morocco's autonomy proposal and the international community's response. The document analyzes the reasons why the Sahrawi people have not been able to exercise their right to self-determination, including Morocco's territorial ambitions, Spain's facilitation of the occupation, and the actions of certain UN Security Council members. The author criticizes the UN's increasing inclination toward integrating the Sahara into Morocco, viewing it as a contradiction of the principle of self-determination.

It covers the historical background of the conflict, the peace agreements reached, the new political landscape, and the perspectives for the future. Key issues discussed include the delays in the referendum, the role of Morocco and the Polisario Front, the involvement of the UN (MINURSO), and the positions of various international actors like Spain, the US, and the EU. The report also examines the potential scenarios for the future, including the possibility of renewed violence or a negotiated settlement. The report specifically discusses the ceasefire agreement of 1991 and the subsequent efforts to implement a peace plan, including the identification of voters and the repatriation of refugees. It details the obstacles and challenges to the peace process, including Morocco's demands regarding voter eligibility and the lack of international support.",

The paper compares the cases of Palestine and Western Sahara, focusing on the unique situation in the Moroccan-Saharan conflict involving the dispersion of the native population and the existence of national minorities outside the territory claimed by national liberation movements. Specifically, it refers to Sahrawis in southern Morocco. The paper argues that the prolonged conflict has generated new dynamics involving different components of these populations, who have their own expectations, live in very different situations, and have opportunities for socialization and communication among themselves. These shared dynamics range from collaboration to the development of common political discourses and a redefinition of identity. The paper states that these processes were not promoted by national liberation movements, but respond to new grassroots dynamics involving forms of organization around demands for citizenship, the use of transnational spaces, and new media.",

It explores the historical and legal context of the conflict, focusing on Morocco's attempts to gain sovereignty over the territory and the Polisario's right to self-determination. The document examines the failure of previous peace plans, including the Plan of Peace of 1990-91 and the Baker I plan, and then scrutinizes the details of Plan Baker II, including its provisions for a referendum and the composition of the electorate. It argues that Plan Baker II is largely favorable to Morocco but is being resisted due to internal political considerations, specifically the potential for democratization in the Western Sahara to destabilize the existing power structure in Morocco. The analysis also directly references the ceasefire agreement by highlighting the risk of renewed hostilities given the potential for a breakdown in the negotiation process, particularly the risk of independent Polisario forces acting without command. The source also reviews the implications for Algeria and Mauritania, and touches upon the international strategic context, including the roles of Spain, France, and the United States. The author expresses concern that Morocco's rejection of the Baker II plan will lead to instability in the region and possibly renewed conflict.",

The author highlights the lack of progress despite years of negotiations and the negative impact of the status quo on Moroccan and Sahrawi societies. The article traces the historical background of the conflict, including Spanish colonialism, the Green March, and the armed conflict between Morocco/Mauritania and the Polisario. It mentions the 1998 Marrakesh meeting and the subsequent ceasefire, but notes the frustration caused by the lack of a definitive solution, including the stalled referendum. The article suggests measures to build trust and facilitate dialogue, such as the release of political prisoners, freedom of expression, and joint management of economic resources. It critiques the UN's role and proposes a more active role for the African Union. The author also emphasized the need for a shared narrative that recognizes the pain on both sides to foster any kind of peaceful negotiation in the future.

It mentions the Frente POLISARIO (Popular Front for the Liberation of Saguia el-Hamra and Río de Oro) as the representative of the Sahrawi people and refers to the war between the Frente POLISARIO and Morocco from 1975 to 1991. Critically, it directly references MINURSO's (United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara) role in securing a ceasefire, implying a relevance to ceasefire agreements, even if the specific terms of the agreement are not detailed in the text. The paper also notes the current grave situation with constant repression of basic rights of Saharawi people, Moroccan occupation of the territory, the Saharawis in refugee camps in Tindouf (Algeria) living off humanitarian aid and the exploitation of the natural resources of Western Sahara by Morocco with the approval of the EU. It concludes that either the international law that recognizes the Saharawi people is applied or the Frente POLISARIO will return to armed conflict against Morocco.",

It focuses on the EU's framing of the situation as a 'forgotten crisis' and examines the linguistic and communicative patterns used in EU political discourse concerning the Western Sahara. The paper highlights the ambiguity in the EU's relationship with the Western Sahara, torn between defending human rights and pursuing economic interests. It discusses the EU's humanitarian aid to the Sahrawi refugees since 1993, the conditions in the refugee camps, and the human rights violations documented by Amnesty International. It further notes that the mandate of MINURSO does not include human rights monitoring. The paper also delves into the exploitation of natural resources, specifically fishing agreements between the EU and Morocco, which impact the Western Sahara. The author argues that the EU's position on the Sahrawi conflict is largely 'contemplative' due to the vested interests of certain member states. The paper concludes that by classifying the Sahrawi population as a 'forgotten crisis,' the EU promotes a 'compassion ethic' that decontextualizes and denies the historical specificity of the refugees, thus perpetuating a cycle of dependence and overlooking the underlying political issues.",

It also covers the formation of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) and the ongoing conflict between Morocco and the Polisario, including diplomatic efforts by the UN and the OAU to find a peaceful resolution.

It discusses the historical context of the conflict, starting from the arrival of Emilio Bonelli in 1885. It highlights the emerging colonizing pressure, Morocco's independence in 1956 and its subsequent expansionist desires over the Sahara based on the idea of a 'Greater Morocco'. It also mentions the Green March in 1975, the weakness of Spain due to Franco's illness, and the Madrid Accords that ceded the territory to Morocco. The rise of Sahrawi nationalism in the late 1960s and the resulting conflict between Morocco and the Polisario are also mentioned. The abstract further states that the conflict had a belligerent nature until the 1990s when it shifted to a purely political conception. The demands for a referendum of self-determination by the Sahrawi people have been denied by the Moroccan government, thus perpetuating the conflict. Although it doesn't specifically mention the ceasefire agreement by name, it discusses the period leading up to it, the belligerent conflict up to the 1990s, implying a shift towards a political solution which occurred with the ceasefire.",

Further, the source elaborates on the establishment of the African Union, Morocco's non-participation due to RASD's membership, and the impact on Morocco's involvement in initiatives such as NEPAD and the African Human Rights System. It concludes by examining Morocco's diplomatic efforts to establish relationships with sub-Saharan African countries and the role of the Moroccan Agency for International Cooperation (AMCI).

It seeks to understand the intensification of political, diplomatic, and commercial ties between the two nations, despite a general decline in Argentina's engagement with African affairs. The thesis attributes this sustained bilateral increase to an \"impulse-driven policy\" characterized by cumulative actions over two decades, influenced by Morocco's receptiveness, Brazil's growing interest in North Africa, and the ideological shifts in Argentina's foreign policy.

However, the joint Hispano-Moroccan statement during the VIII Hispano-Moroccan Summit in Rabat in March 2007, expressing interest in Morocco's autonomy project for Western Sahara, was interpreted by Algeria and the Polisario Front as favoring Morocco. The document also states that negotiations between Morocco and the Sahrawi, initiated in June 2007 near New York, failed to achieve a negotiated solution. The document reports that Spain's efforts to simultaneously improve relations with Morocco and take initiative on the Western Sahara issue were viewed with suspicion by Algeria and the Polisario Front, who perceived Spain as leaning towards Morocco's position. The failure of direct negotiations between Morocco and the Sahrawi further underscores the ongoing conflict and lack of a negotiated solution.",

          "source_summary": "This academic article discusses the legal status of Sahrawis in Spain, focusing on their attempts to gain stateless status. It analyzes the complex historical relationship between Spain and Western Sahara, including the colonial period, the period of provincialization, and the eventual withdrawal of Spain. The article delves into legal arguments surrounding Sahrawi nationality, examining whether they were ever Spanish citizens, whether they are obligated to accept Moroccan nationality, and the implications of the partially recognized Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. The author further examines the role of MINURSO and the arguments surrounding whether its presence precludes Sahrawis from being considered stateless. The article also explores formal legal challenges made to Sahrawi applications for stateless status, such as the requirement to prove lack of nationality and the impact of delayed applications. Finally, it discusses the implications of European directives on refugees and stateless persons for Sahrawis and concludes by reflecting on the complex intersection of law, politics, and human rights in the Sahrawi case.",

While the core focus is on the experiences, identities, and social-political structures of the diaspora community, it contains background information directly relevant to understanding the context that led to the ceasefire agreement with the Polisario Front (اتفاق وقف إطلاق النار مع البوليساريو). Specifically, it discusses the historical context of the Sahrawi people, including the Spanish colonization, the rise of the Polisario Front, the exodus to refugee camps in Tindouf, Algeria, and the subsequent challenges faced by the Sahrawi people in exile. It examines the socio-political organization within the refugee camps, the role of women, and the frustration that ultimately contributed to migration patterns to Spain. The thesis details the colonial history, the rise of Sahrawi nationalism and the Polisario, and the displacement that set the stage for the ceasefire and later diaspora.",

While it doesn't focus specifically on the ceasefire agreement, it does discuss the period after the ceasefire (después del alto al fuego) and its effects on the lives of Sahrawi women. It examines their political activism, human rights violations they have endured, and their strategies for coping and resisting. The document details their involvement in anti-colonial struggles, the period of war, and the subsequent challenges they face, including human rights violations, the denial of their cultural identity, and the struggle for self-determination. Therefore, although the text doesn't specifically analyze the ceasefire agreement with Polisario, it directly pertains to the conditions and context that followed it and contains a section titled \"Después del alto al fuego\", making it relevant.",

            "The document is a study about the historical memory and resistance of Sahrawi women in the occupied territories, published in 2016.",
            "The authors are Irantzu Mendia Azkue and Gloria Guzmán Orellana.",
            "The publication is a result of a project about Human Rights Violations in Western Sahara from 2015.",
            "The document contains a section titled \"Después del alto al fuego\" (After the Ceasefire), which is relevant to the event.",
            "The document highlights the importance of women in the survival and independence of the Sahrawi people.",
            "The study notes that the participation of women as combatants in the Polisario Front was less known than their organization of refugee camps.",
            "The text mentions that Morocco has subjected the Sahrawi population to repression and political and informational isolation.",
            "The document states that women were victims of different types of violence in the recent history of Western Sahara for being Sahrawi, for being part of the Polisario Front, or for having relatives who are or have been accused of being part of it.",
            "The text notes that in 1991, 321 people, including 73 women, were released after being detained-disappeared in secret prisons.",
            "The Intifada of 1992 is mentioned as a significant historical moment, with the participation of women in the student movement.",
            "The Intifada of 2005 is mentioned as a relevant historical event, where young women started their organized participation.",
            "The dismantlement of Gdeim Izik camp in 2010 is seen as a historic opportunity to participate in the resistance.",
            "The text explains that AFAPREDESA (Association of Families of Sahrawi Prisoners and Disappeared) recorded more than 500 disappeared people as a result of the war, of whom nothing more has been heard.",
            "AFAPREDESA also recorded 378 missing persons who reappeared after spending between 4 and 16 years kidnapped in the secret prisons of Agdez, Kalaat Maguna, Shoura and El Aaiún."

It analyzes the right to self-determination of peoples and its international recognition, particularly focusing on its legitimacy, exercise, and application. The study explores the concept of 'people,' the conflict between secession and self-determination, and examines two case studies: Catalonia and Western Sahara. It assesses whether these regions meet the requirements to be recognized as autonomous or independent states, considering various UN resolutions. The document aims to determine the suitability of the right to self-determination in the context of these case studies, in which Western Sahara and the Sahrawi people and the United Nations are discussed in the context of self-determination.",
