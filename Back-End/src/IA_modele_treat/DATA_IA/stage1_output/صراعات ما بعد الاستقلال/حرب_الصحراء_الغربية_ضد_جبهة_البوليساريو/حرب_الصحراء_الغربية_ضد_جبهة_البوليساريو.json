          "source_summary": "This essay analyzes the impact of post-9/11 U.S. policy, specifically the 'War on Terror,' on the Western Sahara conflict between Morocco and the Polisario Front. It argues that Morocco has strategically used the 'War on Terror' rhetoric to delegitimize Polisario and gain U.S. support. The essay also details how the Bush administration's policies undermined the UN peace process led by James Baker. It provides a historical background of the conflict, highlighting Morocco's invasion in 1975, the Polisario's guerrilla struggle, and the UN's attempts to hold a referendum. The analysis focuses on Morocco's efforts to portray Polisario as linked to 'Jihadism' and exploit Western fears of a 'failed state' in the region. The essay criticizes the Bush administration's support for Morocco, including awarding it a free trade agreement and major non-NATO ally status, despite Morocco's intransigence in the peace process and human rights record. The author concludes that the 'War on Terror' has worsened the prospects for a resolution and increased the likelihood of renewed armed conflict between Morocco and Polisario.",

The review summarizes the book's content, noting that it covers the historical roots of the dispute over Western Sahara, including the Spanish colonization in 1884, Morocco's annexation in 1975, and the unsuccessful implementation of the self-determination referendum after the 1991 ceasefire. The book also examines the motivations behind Morocco's annexation, the internal and international context surrounding it (including the Franco-American role), and portrays Polisario as a nationalist movement seeking independence for the Sahrawi people. It mentions that the Western Sahara war (1975-1991) was followed by a realization by the involved parties that the war needed to end.",

The article highlights the role of international actors like Spain, France, the EU, and the US in the conflict, noting France's protection of Morocco within the UN Security Council and the US's shifting stance.

The absence of human rights monitoring by MINURSO and the limited development of a Sahrawi state inside the Western Sahara are also discussed.

It highlights the historical background, starting with Morocco's invasion in 1975 after Spain's withdrawal and the subsequent war until the 1991 cease-fire. The article explains the failure of the UN mission to organize a referendum on independence and Morocco's rejection of any solution that includes this option. It also addresses the roles of the UN Security Council, Morocco, Algeria, and the Sahrawi population in perpetuating the conflict. The impact of the Arab Spring and the Mali crisis on the Western Sahara situation are also examined, as well as the potential for renewed armed struggle and the role of oil exploration in potentially disrupting the status quo.

The chapter provides a comparative insight into the features of Western Sahara as a contested state. It addresses the historical background of Western Sahara's struggle for statehood and explores why the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) doesn't fit typical categories of states. The chapter examines the impact of foreign occupation and extraterritoriality on the SADR's statehood under international law. It discusses the multiple territorialities of Western Sahara/SADR, including the Moroccan-annexed territory, the Algerian-based Sahrawi refugee camps where the Polisario Front and SADR have headquarters, and the Liberated Zone controlled by these actors in Western Sahara. Finally, it addresses the international (non-)recognition of Morocco's claims, the recognition of the Polisario Front, and the partial recognition of the SADR.",

It discusses the socio-historical roots of Sahrawi national identity, focusing on the Sahrawi people inhabiting the Western Sahara, a former Spanish colony. The abstract highlights Morocco's occupation of most of the territory since 1975 and its denial of a distinct Sahrawi population. It contrasts this with the POLISARIO Front's claim to the Western Sahara and its pursuit of full independence based on a unique Sahrawi history, language, and culture.

The conflict resulted in significant displacement, casualties, and the division of the territory. The brief mentions the construction of the 'Berm' by Morocco in the mid-1980s, manned by 150,000 soldiers, which controls 85% of the territory, while the Polisario controls the remaining area. It also discusses the international community's perspective, particularly the concerns of Western governments regarding regional stability and the vulnerability of Sahrawi refugees in Algeria to recruitment by terrorist networks. The brief further analyzes the failure of diplomatic efforts, including the US's attempt to include human rights monitoring in MINURSO's mandate in 2013. The brief concludes by emphasizing the need for Morocco to address socio-economic and human rights grievances in the region and to improve governance practices, to find a lasting resolution to the conflict.",

It details the origins of the conflict following Spain's withdrawal in 1976, the emergence of the Polisario Front, and Morocco's strategy of constructing berms fortified with landmines. It also highlights the ongoing problem of landmines and unexploded ordnance (UXO) in the region, the challenges they pose to the local population and refugees, and the efforts undertaken by organizations such as MINURSO and Landmine Action to address the mine threat. The article discusses the difficulties in record keeping of mine incidents and the impact of landmines on children. Furthermore, the article touches on the failed attempts to resolve the dispute between Morocco and the Polisario and the importance of mine clearance for the safe return of refugees and the overall peace process.",

Spector, titled \"Western Sahara and the Self-Determination Debate,\" discusses the historical and legal complexities surrounding the Western Sahara dispute, focusing on the principle of self-determination. It examines the competing claims of Morocco and the Polisario Front, supported by Algeria, over the territory. The article traces the history of the region from Spanish colonization in 1884, through Morocco and Mauritania's claims after Spain's departure in 1975, to the involvement of the United Nations and the International Court of Justice. It highlights the diplomatic and military proxy war between Algeria and Morocco and the stalemate over a proposed referendum. The article argues that the traditional concept of self-determination is inadequate for resolving modern disputes and suggests a more flexible approach incorporating autonomy and minority rights. Ultimately, Spector calls for a reframing of self-determination as a continuum of rights, promoting international stability and peace, potentially offering a new approach to resolve the conflict and other disputes such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.",

The article also details the violent dismantling of a protest camp in Laâyoune in October 2010, where Sahrawis were demonstrating against poor living conditions. The author criticizes the media coverage of the events, accusing some Western outlets of biased reporting and using propaganda. The article notes the international community's cautious response to the violence, with the UN Security Council declining to open an investigation. It suggests that the events in Laâyoune provided an opportunity for the Polisario Front to regain influence amidst internal challenges and criticisms. The author points to the internal dissent within the Polisario's ranks and the emergence of rival Sahrawi groups, alongside the growing trend of Sahrawis leaving the Tindouf camps. The piece also discusses Morocco's autonomy proposal as a potential solution to the conflict, while highlighting the geopolitical tensions between Algeria and Morocco as a key factor sustaining the conflict. The author suggests that a resolution necessitates a comprehensive approach involving Algeria and cautions against violence and radicalization.

It discusses the period after the 1976-1991 war between Morocco and the Polisario Front and the ongoing \"no war, no peace\" situation. The document examines three specific artistic works: a poem by Moustafa Ould El-Bar Abdeddaïm ridiculing the Moroccan monarch and the UN, a monologue by Mohamed Ghâli addressing the disillusionment within Sahrawi refugee camps, and a song by Nâjim cAllâl directly criticizing the Polisario leadership. The analysis explores the socio-political context of these works, their linguistic features, the performative aspects, and the implications of their online presence. It highlights how these artistic expressions, despite their humorous or satirical nature, reflect and contribute to the ongoing political discourse surrounding the Western Sahara conflict and the Sahrawi identity, also analyzing the limits of free speech in the refugee camps.",

The text discusses the impact of childhood stays in Spain, educational opportunities abroad, and the challenges faced upon returning to the camps. It also touches upon the economic activities, social inequalities, and the desire for independence and a return to the Western Sahara, while facing the realities of life in the refugee camps and the political stalemate.

It analyzes how the tent has become a symbol of national identity and resistance against Moroccan occupation, particularly after the Gdeim Izîk protest camp in 2010. The text explores the connection between the tent, the female body, and the Sahrawi struggle for self-determination, highlighting the role of women in peaceful resistance and the use of new media to expose Moroccan human rights abuses. The document presents two different versions of cultural conservation and promotion around the Western Sahara’s cultural heritage: one is a Moroccan policy that promotes a universalist approach to this heritage, creating a folkloric and controlled image of Sahrawi culture. The other, defended by the Polisario Front, advocates for a particular version of its culture that it recognizes sharing with the Mauritanians but clearly distinguishes from the Moroccan cultures and languages, promoting a living cultural heritage, based on a number of traditions that the Sahrawis try to keep alive but turned towards other forms of contemporary arts (cinema, plastic arts, theater, RAP, written literature, etc.). It refers to the armed conflict of 1975-1991 and the ceasefire. It examines the symbolic importance of the tent and campamentos in the context of Western Sahara, occupation, forced sedentarization and exile, including the distinction between vrîg (nomadic camp) and muḫayyam (refugee camp). The text references the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (RASD) and the Polisario Front's efforts to preserve Sahrawi culture, facing challenges from Moroccan policies and the migration of young people.",

          "source_summary": "This paper discusses the ambivalent policy of the European Union (EU) regarding the Western Sahara conflict, focusing on the legal perspective. It argues that while the political organs of the EU have historically recognized Morocco's sovereignty over Western Sahara through international agreements and subsequent conduct, the EU's judicial organs have recently adopted an opposing stance, potentially acting ultra vires and contradicting international law. The paper specifically references the Front Polisario's legal challenges to EU-Morocco agreements concerning agricultural products and fisheries, and the resulting court decisions. It analyzes the EU's implicit recognition of Moroccan sovereignty through a series of fisheries agreements signed and renewed between the 1980s and 2010s, as well as the EU's subsequent conduct in their application. The author contends that the EU's contradictory stance undermines its credibility and infringes upon Morocco's sovereign rights. The paper also discusses the legal arguments surrounding the application of international law, including the principle of self-determination, permanent sovereignty over natural resources, and the law of treaties, to the Western Sahara dispute. It critiques the European Court of Justice's (ECJ) decisions, arguing that they are based on an erroneous interpretation of international law and an overreach of judicial authority. The paper concludes by emphasizing the need for the EU to reconcile its conflicting positions and adhere to established principles of international law in its dealings with Morocco and the Western Sahara issue.",

It examines the role of NGOs and media in portraying suffering, and how these representations can sometimes depoliticize victims and create a sense of distance. The study uses the example of Sahrawi refugees in camps in southwestern Algeria, administered by the Polisario Front, to illustrate these points. The author describes how women in the Sahrawi refugee camps have become important symbols and allies for both NGOs and the Polisario Front, ensuring the permanence of the camps and providing a basis for the national struggle. However, they also are subject to potentially stereotypical and disempowering representations. The document questions the long-term impact of victim representations, pondering whether it sensationalizes an industry of representation, and fails to promote genuine understanding and dignity for others.",

Key aspects explored include the erosion of genealogical memory, the changing roles of women, the emergence of a new social contract, and the challenges faced by families in the refugee camps. The article highlights the resilience of Sahrawi women who took on new responsibilities in the camps while men were fighting.

The document emphasizes the similarities between the Moroccan initiative and New Caledonia's autonomy status since 1999, highlighting aspects like the presence of indigenous populations desiring autonomous management of their territories and resources. The analysis delves into political choices in negotiating autonomy agreements, including the importance of offering future perspectives, recognizing the identity of the concerned people, and fostering reconciliation. It examines the elements of New Caledonia's autonomy, such as recognizing local symbols, implementing Caledonian citizenship, and protecting local employment. It covers the details of the institutional engineering in New Caledonia like the setup of local institutions and progressive and irreversible transfers of powers.",

The article explores the socio-economic grievances, the nationalistic and independence-seeking aspects of the protests, and their relation to the ongoing dispute between Morocco and the Polisario Front. It also examines the limited impact of the Arab Spring and Moroccan reforms on the political situation in Western Sahara and the international efforts to resolve the conflict, including the role of MINURSO and various peace proposals.

It focuses on two General Court (TG) judgments from September 29, 2021, which annulled Council decisions related to free trade and fisheries agreements between the EU and Morocco, arguing they violated international law by not obtaining the consent of the Sahrawi people. The author celebrates the TG's correction of the political drift in these decisions, affirming that agreements are only valid with Sahrawi consent through the Polisario Front. However, the author criticizes the TG for maintaining the decisions' effects pending appeal, as they violate the right to self-determination.

It explores how clientelism and poor economic management by the Moroccan state have polarized society and fueled rivalries among ethnic groups due to unequal income distribution. The paper identifies four major migratory waves since Morocco's annexation of Western Sahara, leading to socio-demographic shifts and divisions. These waves were triggered by the Frente Polisario's propaganda (1975), economic opportunities created by Moroccan policies (mid-1980s), Morocco's relocation of Saharawis for a UN referendum (1991), and the return of Saharawis from Tindouf camps due to poor conditions and Moroccan incentives. The study also discusses the convergence of radicalism and organized crime, including the involvement of Saharawis in drug trafficking and Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI). It concludes that lack of opportunities and economic hardship, coupled with organized crime and the influence of AQMI, could encourage Saharawis to join extremist groups, posing a security challenge.",

The text highlights the legal battles following the 1991 ceasefire and the Polisario's shift from armed struggle to legal action. The document analyzes a specific ECJ ruling annulling the Council decision regarding trade liberalization measures because the Council failed to ensure the exploitation of resources wouldn't harm the Sahrawi population.

It examines how Spanish colonization and cartography impacted the spatial understanding and nomadic patterns of the Sahrawi tribes, and how this contributed to the development of the conflict. The thesis aims to analyze the role of Spanish colonial cartography in establishing a modern territorial state in Western Sahara and explore the geographical imaginaries present in the conflict. It also considers the potential for 'counter-cartography' to challenge colonial narratives and represent the contemporary spatial reality of the Sahrawi people, including territorial fragmentation and exile. The project will use a combination of theoretical study, archival research, and fieldwork in Sahrawi refugee camps to investigate the continuities and discontinuities between pre-colonial, colonial, and contemporary Sahrawi geographical imaginaries. The Frente Polisario is mentioned as defending the right to self-determination of the former Spanish Sahara and using the territory's silhouette on its shield.",

The review highlights that the book addresses the decades-long, unresolved conflict in Western Sahara, stemming from Spain's withdrawal and transfer of administration to Morocco and Mauritania via the Madrid Accords on February 27, 1976, without ensuring complete decolonization and self-determination as mandated by the UN. It examines the resulting international stalemate, the Moroccan occupation without international recognition, and the plight of Sahrawi refugees. The book analyzes the evolving dynamics, including the Sahrawi state in exile, the development of a trans-border Sahrawi political identity, and new forms of collective action. It notes the deteriorating living conditions due to decreased aid since 2011 and Morocco's strategies to consolidate its annexation. The review also touches upon the Frente Polisario's demand for a referendum of self-determination, the Sahrawi population's resistance across refugee camps, occupied territories, and diaspora, and Spain's continuous political engagement with the issue.",

It argues that the CJ reiterated Western Sahara's status as a non-self-governing territory and the Saharawi people's right to self-determination. However, it criticizes the CJ for avoiding explicitly recognizing Morocco as the occupying power since its invasion in late 1975. The article discusses the Polisario Front's standing before the CJ and the principle of the relative effect of treaties, emphasizing the need for the Saharawi people's consent for EU-Morocco agreements to apply to Western Sahara. While acknowledging the CJ's rulings, the author finds its arguments about implied consent contradictory and lacking legal basis. The article further analyzes the labeling of products from Western Sahara and the EU's obligation to respect international law in its external actions.

The article focuses on the Polisario Front's legal efforts to assert sovereignty over natural resources in Western Sahara and prevent their exploitation by Morocco without the Sahrawi people's consent. It mentions controversies brought by the Polisario Front before the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) regarding agricultural and fisheries agreements between the EU and Morocco. The article aims to present the jurisprudential background and the CJEU's decision that the territory of Western Sahara, including its adjacent waters, cannot be included in these agreements because it does not belong to the Kingdom of Morocco.",

From 1988 to 2013, the EU supported negotiations between Morocco and the Polisario Front for the self-determination of the Sahrawi people. During this period, the EU also negotiated agreements with Morocco that, while not explicitly including Western Sahara, were applied to the territory. The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) ruled in several decisions (2015-2018) that agreements with Morocco should only apply to Morocco. In 2019, the Council and the Commission explicitly included Western Sahara in agreements with Morocco, disregarding the Polisario Front, the representative of the Sahrawi people. Judgements of the General Court in 2021, if confirmed by the CJEU, would potentially end the practice of recognizing the Polisario Front as a negotiating party for the political self-determination of Western Sahara while denying them a role in its economic self-determination.",

It notes the decline of this oral tradition due to adverse socio-political conditions. The presentation highlights a renewed interest among young Sahrawi graduates and Spanish university researchers in recovering, recording, and disseminating the oral memory of the Western Sahara through Hassaniya poetry. This poetry provides insights into the experiences of the colonized during Spanish colonialism, encompassing satirical, social, epic, and descriptive poems reflecting daily life throughout the 20th century. It serves as a source of inspiration for new generations of poets connecting with previously obscure passages and landscapes through the memories of elderly individuals.",

It begins by framing the context of the Sahrawi population divided between Moroccan-occupied territories, Tindouf refugee camps, and the diaspora. It highlights the initial revolutionary efforts after 1975 to create a modern, egalitarian society, but also acknowledges the persistence of traditional cultural patterns that hinder true equality for women and Afro-Sahrawis. The document discusses the historical background of Western Sahara, the establishment and organization of the Tindouf refugee camps, and the evolution of the status of women in Sahrawi society, including traditional customs, marriage practices, and the impact of education. It addresses contemporary issues such as legal reforms, women's rights, marriage and divorce practices, the situation of single mothers, and the controversial issue of women retained against their will by their families. The article also covers economic developments in the camps, the fight against traditional beauty standards, sex education, and the role of the Abidin Kaid Saleh film school. It also examines the activism within Sahrawi communities. Finally, the text addresses the emancipation of Afro-Sahrawis and the lingering effects of slavery and discrimination. The document concludes by emphasizing the need for a holistic approach to emancipation, including education, health, legal reforms, economic opportunities, and the elimination of racial discrimination.",

It examines several key points: the CJEU's rulings that Western Sahara is a non-self-governing territory and not part of Morocco, the implications of this status for the applicability of EU-Morocco agreements, the legal principles governing resource exploitation in occupied territories, and the active role of the Polisario Front in challenging these agreements in court. The study criticizes the CJEU for what it sees as contradictory rulings and a reluctance to fully address the legal consequences of Morocco's presence in Western Sahara, while highlighting the arguments made by the Advocate General (AG) regarding the application of international humanitarian law. It also discusses the EU's efforts to 'comply' with the CJEU's rulings by consulting with local populations, but criticizes this approach as a way to avoid genuine consultation with the Sahrawi people. Finally, it addresses the Polisario Front's legal actions against companies operating in Western Sahara and the implications of these actions for the future of resource exploitation in the region.

These events significantly impacted the Western Sahara conflict. The review highlights several key developments:\n\n1.  Morocco's violation of the military agreement with MINURSO in Guerguerat on November 13, 2020, leading the Polisario Front to declare the ceasefire broken (established September 6, 1991).\n2.  The US recognition of Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara by then-President Trump in November 2020, followed by a tripartite agreement between the US, Morocco, and Israel in December 2020.\n3.  Morocco's diplomatic crises with Spain and Germany due to issues including claims over Spanish territories in North Africa and Germany's stance against the US recognition of Moroccan sovereignty.\n4.  The EU General Court's rulings in September 2021 annulling EU-Morocco agreements that included Western Sahara.\n5.  The failure of Morocco and the US to fully comply with their December 2020 tripartite agreement commitments.\n6.  Algeria's severance of diplomatic relations with Morocco in August 2021, citing Morocco's failure to uphold commitments made in 1988 regarding a referendum of self-determination for Western Sahara.\n\nThe review also criticizes the book for factual errors, omissions, and questionable judgments regarding the OAU/AU's role in the conflict. Furthermore, it finds the book's conclusions, which suggest the Polisario Front should accept autonomy under Moroccan rule, to be inconsistent with its own acknowledgment of Morocco's untrustworthiness and the ineffectiveness of international guarantees.",

The Frente Polisario challenged the legality of the agreement, arguing that it included waters adjacent to Western Sahara without the consent of the Sahrawi people, thereby violating their right to self-determination. The ECJ ultimately annulled the Council's decision to approve the agreement, finding that the EU had failed to ensure the consent of the Sahrawi people, considered a 'third party' to the agreement, as required by the principle of the relative effect of treaties. The court recognized the Frente Polisario's legal standing to bring the case. The ruling's effects were suspended pending appeal. The document analyzes the ECJ's reasoning regarding the Frente Polisario's legal personality, the direct and individual impact of the agreement on the Frente Polisario, and the importance of obtaining explicit and free consent from the Sahrawi people regarding the exploitation of resources in Western Sahara. It emphasizes the importance of the principle of the relative effect of treaties and its application to the Sahrawi people's right to self-determination in the context of international agreements.",

It examines parliamentary debates, interventions, and resolutions concerning the conflict, focusing on the balance between maintaining good relations with Morocco and supporting the Sahrawi people's right to self-determination. The study finds that the parliament's influence is limited, acting more as a reflector of governmental policies and international dynamics, especially concerning UN peace plans and human rights issues. It discusses key parliamentary actions, including motions supporting the Plan Baker, concerns over human rights violations, and debates surrounding the referendum on self-determination. The article also considers the impact of the Arab Spring on the parliamentary discourse related to Western Sahara.
