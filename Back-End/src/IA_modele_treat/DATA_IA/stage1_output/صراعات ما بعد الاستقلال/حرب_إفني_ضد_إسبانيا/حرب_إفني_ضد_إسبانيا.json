The paper examines how the press, under strict censorship and control, manipulated information about the conflict, contributing to its being largely forgotten in Spain. The analysis covers various strategies employed by the press, including the suppression of information, the dissemination of propaganda, the manipulation of language, the attribution of blame to external enemies (communism), and historical manipulation. It also delves into the historical context, Spanish interests in the Ifni region, and the legal framework governing journalistic practices during the Franco regime. The paper uses a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative content analysis of several Spanish newspapers and magazines with in-depth interviews with individuals who experienced the Ifni War or had a professional connection to it, to compare lived experiences and the press narrative. The article concludes that the press, controlled by the Franco regime, presented the war as a heroic endeavor while minimizing its significance and concealing negative aspects, resulting in a distorted collective memory of the conflict.",

It explores how media outlets managed information during these crises and the objectives pursued by different social actors in this process. The document also examines historical precedents for media influence in conflicts, the challenges of balancing critical scrutiny with national defense, and the rise of 'conspiranoia' in postmodern society. The document dedicates significant attention to the Ifni War, including the military reality, media coverage, and political implications. It provides insight into the contradictions in media management during the conflict, the roles of different actors (Spain, Morocco, the United States, France), and the eventual handover of Tarfaya to Morocco. It also addresses media management during the Sahara conflict and the Perejil Island crisis.",

It discusses the Ifni War (1957-1958) as a silenced conflict and explores why it is often ignored compared to other historical events like the Spanish Civil War. The paper introduces the concept of 'banal silence' to describe the societal indifference towards certain contentious historical issues, such as the Spanish colonial past. It also touches upon Spain's responsibilities in the Western Sahara conflict and the broader implications of collective memory, historical narratives, and shame in shaping how a nation remembers or forgets its past. The article also discusses the use of chemical weapons during the Rif War and how a motion to acknowledge this was dismissed by the Spanish Parliament. The study uses history textbooks as a source of data points for how the conflict has been presented over time, noting that the Ifni War is often absent from these materials.",

The study analyzes the 'pact of silence' following the Franco dictatorship, arguing that silence can both nurture and erase memory. It introduces the concept of 'banal silence,' where contentious historical issues are unnoticed and naturalized. The paper touches upon Ifni, ceded to Spain by the Sultan of Morocco in 1860, and the Sahara, given to Spain at the Berlin Conference in 1884, in the context of Spain's colonial past. It also mentions the Green March in 1976, which led to the inclusion of Western Sahara into Morocco, and the ongoing conflict with the Polisario Front. The author references a book by Amo, B. (2009) titled *Humo y estrellas. Sidi Ifni, la guerra ignorada*. Murcia: Editorial Nemira, and a book by Segura Valero, G. (2006) titled *Ifni. La guerra que silenció Franco*. Madrid: Ediciones Martínez Roca, as well as an article by Vidal Guardiola, L. M. (2006) titled *Ifni 1957–1958. La prensa y la guerra que nunca existió*. Madrid: Almena.",

The chapter also discusses how counterinsurgency efforts were gendered, with African women being targeted and used by military and civil planners. The integration of African women through education and social programs was seen as a way to stabilize society and preserve the empire.

Published online on August 31, 2017, the chapter proposes a comprehensive approach to understanding imperial rhetoric in Spanish African territories. It examines the shifting connotations of Spain's imperial discourse, specifically 'hispanotropicalismo,' which aimed to construct an inclusive image of harmonious multi-ethnic and multi-continental nations, similar to the Portuguese 'lusotropicalismo'. This discourse was supported by rhetorics of progress and modernization, impacting both Spanish imperial agents and colonial 'partners'. The chapter includes a case study of the colonial branch of the Seccion Femenina de Falange (SF), the official women's organization in Spain, and its attempts to cultivate a cooperative female elite. It explores how official rhetoric legitimized and shaped actions within the Spanish overseas provinces in Africa. Given that the Ifni War took place in a Spanish overseas province in Africa during the 1950s, and that the chapter examines Spanish rhetoric of empire during that period, the chapter is directly relevant to the conflict.",

The analysis draws on Spanish historical archives and approximately 150 interviews conducted in Western Sahara between 2008-2009 and 2011-2012. The study focuses on the various forms of Sahrawi resistance, including \"micro-resistance,\" present since the final stage of Spanish colonial rule and the Moroccan takeover. It notes that these forms of resistance have only become visible to the outside world and achieved a global impact in the last two decades.

It analyzes 44 interstate conflicts from the Correlates of War database, considering battle-related fatalities and whether the participant won the conflict. Quality of life is assessed using Clioinfra data based on political, demographic, economic, and multidimensional factors. The TOPSIS method is used to construct rankings, and criteria weights are calculated using the ROC approach. The study includes an analysis of the Ifni War (ESP_158) and its impact on Spain, noting its visibility in the demographic and social spheres. The paper finds that additional criteria related to quality of life change the rankings of conflict severity. The inclusion of these additional criteria connected to different spheres of quality of life leads to different conclusions, and that considering the quality of life alongside war characteristics offers a more nuanced understanding of conflict severity.",

It explains how the arrival of Muslim troops shaped the perception of the inhabitants of the Iberian Peninsula. The article explores the religious landscape before and after the Muslim arrival, highlighting the coexistence of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam (convivencia). It also mentions the Reconquista period and the unification of Spain under the Catholic Kings in 1492, which led to the expulsion of Jews and the identification of \"Catholic\" and \"Spanish\" as synonymous. It discusses the broader historical context of Spanish colonization in Africa, referencing events which could have eventually contributed to the conditions surrounding the Ifni War.",

It argues that ethno-religious divisions and political propaganda, especially during the Francoist dictatorship, significantly shaped Spain's linguistic actions and legacy in the region. The article outlines three historical periods of Spanish language influence in North Africa, including the colonial period from 1859-1974, encompassing the Spanish-Moroccan War (1859-1860), the establishment of the Protectorate in northern Morocco (1912-1956), and the colonization of the Sahara (1924-1976). It contrasts Spanish and French colonial approaches, highlighting Spain's focus on sectarian education based on religious divisions, in contrast to France's aim of creating an assimilated elite through French language education. The article also addresses the use of language policies as a propaganda tool to improve Spain's international image, particularly after its isolation following World War II. It concludes by examining the aftermath of Spanish colonialism and the continued presence of Spanish language and culture in North Africa, including the Western Sahara, where it serves as an identity marker for the Sahrawi people.",

It argues that the Sahrawi have been victims of multiple colonial powers, initially subjected to different French and Spanish colonial policies as parts of their land were included in colonies like Morocco, Algeria, and Mauretania, as well as Western Sahara itself. After the Spanish withdrawal from Western Sahara, Morocco, driven by irredentist ambitions, stepped in to claim the territory as a province, effectively becoming the new colonial power. The article highlights Morocco's exploitation of the international climate to further its colonialistic aims, suggesting that major global powers, driven by their perceived interests, condoned Morocco's annexationist designs. The author notes the irony of Morocco, itself a former colony of France and Spain, now acting as a colonial power over the Sahrawi.",

The book examines the engagement of Portugal and Spain with women in their African colonies during the period from the 1950s to the 1970s. It explores the rhetoric of benevolent Iberian colonialism, gendered Westernization, and development for African women, as well as imperial practices such as forced resettlement and sexual exploitation. The book focuses on Angola, Mozambique, Western Sahara, and Equatorial Guinea and utilizes newly available documents from Portuguese and Spanish women’s organizations overseas. It offers insights into how African women perceived and responded to their assigned roles in preserving the empires and stabilizing Afro-Iberian ties. The book also compares imperial strategies regarding women with the notions of African anticolonial movements about women's contribution to the struggle for independence.",

It explores the dynamics of the Spanish-Canarian presence, the socio-political power relations, the production of space and identity, and the prospects for economic alliances and globalization. It analyzes the evolution of Sidi Ifni as an enclave, the impact of Spanish colonization, the role of education and migration, and the geostrategic reconstruction of the territory in the 21st century. It covers the period leading up to the Ifni War, the war's influence on the region, and subsequent economic and social changes.",

            "France considered Sidi Ifni a potential hub of resistance and aimed to divide the Aït Baâmrane population to weaken Spanish influence.",

            "During the period 1934-1958, the urban society of Sidi Ifni began to identify with the colonial cultural model, and some members of Aït Baâmrane assimilated into 'Spanish nobility'.",

            "Following Morocco's independence in 1956, the Spanish colonial system was compelled to withdraw from Sidi Ifni 10 years later, which alludes to 1966 but the actual retrocession was in 1969.",

The article details the factors driving Spanish actions, including defense of the Canary Islands, competition with France, and exploitation of natural resources. It examines the urban development of key cities like Villa Cisneros (Dakhla) and El Ayoun (Laâyoune), highlighting the symbolic and political functions of urban planning in consolidating colonial control and facilitating the acculturation of the Sahrawi population.

While the main focus is on urbanization and territorial control, the text directly mentions the occupation of Ifni and its importance in the broader context of Spanish colonial presence.

While mainly centered on the Algerian War, the review touches upon the Franco regime's changing attitude towards Moroccan and Algerian nationalists. Initially, Spain permitted Moroccan nationalists to use Spanish zones as a rear base against the French protectorate from 1953, and from 1954, similar support was given to Algerian nationalists of the FLN in Oranie. However, after Morocco's independence in March 1956, and the subsequent attempt by the Moroccan Liberation Army to expel Spain from Ifni and Rio de Oro, Spain shifted its policy. It drew closer to France from February 1957, launching a combined operation against the Moroccan Liberation Army in the Sahara (Operation \"Écouvillon\" in February 1958). Later, Franco supported France at the UN regarding the Algerian issue.",

It notes that Morocco regained the northern zone upon independence in 1956 and, between 1958 and 1975, recovered Ifni, Tarfaya, Seguia el-Hamra, and Oued Dahab while Spain maintained control over Ceuta and Melilla. The text also delves into the economic activities and the significant role of commerce and smuggling, emphasizing the complex transnational relationships between these enclaves and adjacent Moroccan cities. Finally, it addresses current challenges, including Moroccan claims to the enclaves, the negative impact of contraband trade, and the vulnerability of \"women mulets\" involved in cross-border trade.

          "source_summary": "This document analyzes the use of history on Spanish television during the late Francoist period (late 1960s and early 1970s). It argues that the regime used historical programming, including documentaries, films, and telenovelas, to shape public opinion and promote its own legitimacy. While ostensibly educational or entertaining, these programs often served a propagandistic purpose, either by reinforcing nationalist sentiments, diverting attention from the regime's origins in the Spanish Civil War, or promoting a pro-Western, anti-communist worldview. The analysis covers the types of historical events depicted, the genres used to portray them, the reasons for the selection and presentation of specific historical narratives, and the influence of economic factors and censorship on television content. Critically, the source mentions the absence of coverage of the Ifni War as part of a strategy to avoid potentially undesirable reactions and maintain a carefully constructed image of national peace and stability. It suggests that the dictatorship strategically concealed its history, especially the Civil War, while emphasizing other historical periods for propaganda or entertainment purposes. The article emphasizes the transition from the Franco regime, it's focus on the glorification of the past, and how television was used as an instrument of both culture and control, ultimately contributing to the collective amnesia regarding uncomfortable historical truths.",

The article also explores the biased and limited views imposed by the Spanish administration and the continuity of colonial perspectives in postcolonial discourse. While the article primarily focuses on the literary and political aspects of the Western Sahara conflict, it mentions the \"guerre d’Ifni\" (Ifni War) as one of the significant episodes of the colonial history that has been a subject of autobiographical narratives by Spanish military personnel who served in the Sahara. These narratives, characterized by colonial nostalgia, offer insights into the composition and specificities of the different corps of the Spanish army.",

While it primarily covers French actions, it mentions the involvement of Spanish forces in the region and touches upon Operation Ecouvillon (Teide and Ecouvillon), a Franco-Spanish operation in 1958 against the Armée de Libération (Army of Liberation). This Army of Liberation's activities are directly linked to the broader context of anti-colonial movements and resistance, including those affecting Spanish territories like Ifni and Tarfaya, which are key locations in the \"حرب إفني ضد إسبانيا\" (Ifni War against Spain). The document details the shifting roles of the French military in the Sahara, the challenges of controlling nomadic populations, and the evolution of military missions from conquest to maintaining order, highlighting the complex interplay between French and Spanish colonial interests and the local resistance movements that sparked the Ifni War. The text also covers the historical context of French colonization in Mauritania, touching on events leading up to and just after Moroccan independence, including the activities of the Moroccan Army of Liberation in the Spanish Sahara. It further details military strategies and the incorporation of indigenous elements into colonial units, also the French perspective on the 'Armée de Libération marocaine' and its impact on regional stability.",

The thesis examines the Ifni War, also known as the Forgotten War, considering it not just as a Moroccan aggression against Spanish colonial vestiges but within the broader political context of the time, connecting it to events in French West Africa (AOF). The review highlights the thesis's use of previously unexamined archival sources from Spanish, French, and American archives. It also explains how the thesis is structured, discussing the origins of European presence in the Maghreb, the political evolution of Morocco and the A.O.E. before the conflict, an analysis of the military conflict itself (including Spanish-French cooperation and the influence of the Algerian War), and the consequences of the Treaty of Cintra, including the retrocession of Ifni to Morocco in 1969, the conflict's impact on the civilian population and native troops, and a re-estimation of casualties on all sides. The review emphasizes that the thesis challenges traditional interpretations of the conflict in Spanish historiography, though it notes the author's inability to access Moroccan documentary sources.",

The thesis reviews existing historiography on the Spanish colonial conflict, often interpreted as Moroccan aggression against Spanish colonial vestiges. The author challenges traditional views influenced by former military personnel, providing new interpretations using archival sources from Spanish, French, and American archives, including Servicio Histórico- Militar, Fundación Francisco Franco, Archivo General de la Administración, Service Historique de la Défense, Department of State, and Central Intelligence Agency. The thesis contextualizes the military conflict within the political environment, linking it to events in French West Africa during 1956-1957. It analyzes the European presence in the Maghreb, the emergence of Spanish West Africa (A.O.E.) until 1956, contrasting Spanish, French, and Moroccan perspectives, highlighting the Algeciras Conference and colonial conflicts between Spain and France. The thesis examines Moroccan political evolution, the A.O.E., U.S. policy influence, the power struggle in Morocco between Mohammed V and Istiqlal, Spanish policy contradictions regarding the National Liberation Army, and Spanish ambiguity toward the invasion of French Mauritania (October 1956-February 1957). The analysis focuses on the military conflict, the Spanish-French collaboration leading to the Sahara offensive, and incorporates testimonies of Spanish ex-combatants. The thesis also discusses the Algerian War's influence, the U.S. stance, the naval action of Agadir, the Treaty of Cintra's consequences, Ifni's development, its retrocession to Morocco in 1969, the conflict's impact on civilians and native troops serving Spain, and a re-evaluation of losses on all sides using declassified documents from the Service Historique de la Défense.

The review mentions the start of Spanish control in 1934 and its end in 1969, the Francoist regime's propaganda, and the emergence of dissenting voices after the mid-1970s referring to the Ifni War as the \"ignored war\" or \"last war\". The review details the various chapters of the book, specifically the economic aspects of the colony, the media coverage and censorship of the Ifni War, the battle of Edchera and the fate of Spanish prisoners, the perspectives of Moroccan veterans of the Liberation Army, the symbolic occupation of space through urban planning and Catholic rituals, medical assistance during the war, the role of the Sección Femenina (Women's Section), and the presence of prostitution. The text also touches on the impact of Moroccan independence in 1956 on the desire of the population to reintegrate into Morocco.

The article discusses how the novel deals with the historical memory of the conflict, the harsh conditions faced by Spanish soldiers, and the censorship imposed by the Franco regime to hide the true extent of the war. It highlights the historical context of Morocco's independence in 1956 and subsequent attacks on Spanish-controlled areas like Ifni (until 1969) and the Sahara Occidental (until 1975). The article further analyzes the novel's use of docufiction techniques, combining personal testimony with fictional elements and archival material to create a narrative about the war and its impact on individuals and families. It examines the generational conflict between the father, who served in Ifni, and the son, who rediscovers his father's past through the comic. The author criticizes the comic's Eurocentric perspective, which overlooks the experiences of the colonized population and downplays the violence of the colonial power. The article concludes that while the comic attempts to rescue a forgotten conflict, it ultimately falls short of fully addressing the complexities of Spanish colonialism in Africa.",

It covers topics ranging from the economic aspects of the colony to the Ifni War (1957-1958), religion, medicine, and the roles of women. The review highlights individual chapters, including one that argues the Ifni War was not truly silenced by the Franco regime but rather censored, and another that examines the media coverage of the conflict in the Spanish press, noting the regime's efforts to frame the conflict within the context of the Cold War. It also touches upon the experiences of both Spanish and Moroccan veterans of the conflict and the symbolic appropriation of space in the colony.

It explores how these documentaries, produced by both private companies like Hermic Films and the public entity NO-DO, portrayed the colonization of Ifni and how the contradictions within the Franco regime influenced the representations. It pays particular attention to the period of the province (1958-1969) and how developmentalist discourses and optimistic allusions to tourism were used during that time, amidst growing pressure for decolonization.

It describes the war as an 'unofficial' conflict censored by Franco's regime and downplayed as a mere 'incident.' The article aims to shed light on this historical event, known mainly within military circles and among historians and veterans. The text covers the historical context of Spanish colonization in Ifni and the Spanish Sahara, starting with early contacts by Mediterranean civilizations. It then discusses the creation of the Ifni enclave following the War of Africa in 1859-1860. The article details the rise of Moroccan nationalism and the formation of the Army of Liberation (EA), highlighting the political maneuvering by the Franco regime to gain favor with Moroccan nationalists. It also covers the lead-up to the Ifni War, including growing tensions, incidents, and the lack of preparedness of the Spanish forces. Finally, it describes the attacks on Ifni and the Spanish Sahara in November 1957, the military operations, and the eventual handover of Ifni to Morocco in 1969, framing it within the broader context of anti-colonial struggles and the Franco regime's propaganda.",

The letter details a conversation with King Hassan II of Morocco regarding the future of Spanish-Moroccan relations and territorial disputes. The document reveals Hassan II's concerns and priorities related to North Africa, the process of decolonization, and the Cold War context. Hassan II sought to negotiate the integration of Ifni and the Western Sahara into Morocco, offering economic and strategic benefits to Spain in return. He emphasized the urgency of reaching an agreement before parliamentary sessions began, fearing opposition pressure. The document mentions that the transfer of territories from Spain to Morocco did not occur immediately, leading to conflicts such as the Ifni War of 1957-1958. The article also mentions the Spanish government's determination to retain Sidi Ifni and Sahara due to security considerations. Hassan II proposed three possible stances for Spain: accepting decolonization and association with Morocco, creating an independent state in the Sahara, or mirroring Portugal's colonial policies, with the first being preferred. The article further describes that the pressure exerted by the Moroccan government eventually led to a meeting between Franco and Hassan II at Barajas Airport but that the offer of negotiation on the terms proposed by Hassan II was ultimately not accepted.",

It examines the populations of these territories, both Spanish and native, and the repatriation of Spaniards following decolonization. The article details population figures, economic activities, and social structures of the Spanish colonies in Africa, with a section specifically dedicated to Ifni. It provides data on the European population in Ifni from 1950-1967, and discusses the indigenous population, their economic activities, and their role as auxiliaries to the Spanish administration. It also addresses the evacuation of Ifni and the indemnifications provided due to decolonization. The article also covers the Spanish presence in Ifni, including its occupation in 1934 and retrocession to Morocco in 1969, and mentions the 1957 aggression by the \"Ejército de Liberación.\" The source also covers Spanish Morocco, Guinea Ecuatorial and Spanish Sahara.

It covers the systematic study of the memory of the campaigns based on primary sources, especially press and publications. The review also notes the historiographical neglect of certain events like the Kert War (1911-1912) and the 1924 retreat, in favor of other events. The review suggests that the Ifni War (1957-1958) could be added to the cycle of wars. The review also emphasizes the importance of the Africa War (1859-1860) as the starting point for understanding the perception of subsequent conflicts.

It discusses the historical context of Ifni, a small enclave 'reconquered' by Spain in 1935, and the subsequent recruitment of native soldiers by Franco. It highlights the Moroccan independence in 1956 and the ensuing territorial claims that led to violent conflict, with the invasion of Ifni and the Sahara by a Moroccan-backed 'liberation army' between 1957 and 1958. The article points out the Spanish government's attempts to conceal the war and the lack of recognition it received even after the transition to democracy. It mentions the eventual handover of Ifni to Morocco in 1969 and the ceding of the Sahara in 1975. The author estimates that around 60,000 soldiers were deployed to these territories between 1954 and 1969, primarily from compulsory drafts. The core focus is on identifying and listing over twenty soldiers from Montblanc who served during this period, documenting their names, service details (years, corps, rank, specialty), and highlighting some individual stories. The article ends by suggesting that Montblanc suffered disproportionately in the drafts for the war.",

While not exclusively focused on the Ifni War, it details the broader context of Spanish colonialism in the region, including Ifni and the Sahara, and the eventual abandonment of the territory to Morocco and Mauritania. The text addresses the economic, social, and political factors driving Spanish policy in the Sahara, the exploitation of resources like phosphates, and the impact of the Frente Polisario's activities. The key event described is the evacuation of Spanish civilians and military personnel from the Sahara in 1975, prompted by rising tensions and the Moroccan Green March. This evacuation had a significant impact on the Canary Islands, as many evacuees were relocated there, creating social and economic challenges. It also describes the agreements made between Spain, Morocco, and Mauritania that led to the end of Spanish presence in the Western Sahara.

It mentions the transition of Sáhara and Ifni into Spanish provinces in 1958 and the societal changes following the end of the Ifni War (1958). The Sección Femenina aimed to integrate Sahrawi women into a capitalist system through education, vocational training (like sewing and textile manufacturing at \"Confecciones Sáhara\"), and the promotion of certain domestic practices. However, the organization encountered resistance and reinterpretation of its ideals by the Sahrawi population, particularly with the rise of nationalist sentiments and the Frente Polisario. The document analyzes the complex dynamics of colonialism, gender, and identity in the Spanish Sahara during this period, focusing on the Sección Femenina's role and the evolving societal context after the Ifni War.",

            "The Sección Femenina's project aimed to shape women according to a certain model, fitting into a specific conception of gender relations within a capitalist context.",
            "The Sección Femenina criticized the polygamous practices of Sahrawi society, highlighting the frequent marriages and divorces of both men and women.",

The document investigates the events leading up to Bassiri's arrest in June 1970, the conflicting accounts of his fate, and the political motivations behind the Spanish government's inaction in pursuing the case. The analysis also includes the geopolitical context of the events, focusing on the tension between Morocco and Spain over the Sahara, Moroccan irredentism, and the concerns within the Spanish colonial administration about potential Moroccan interference.",

            "The official Spanish version claims Bassiri was deported to Morocco on June 29, 1970, but doubts remain about whether he arrived alive.",
            "The United Nations mission in 1975 inquired about Bassiri's fate to the Spanish government.",
            "The Moroccan narrative initially ignored Bassiri until 2008, when a Polisario-backed campaign emerged to investigate his disappearance.",
            "The Moroccan narrative now portrays Bassiri as a 'martyr' for the union of the Sahara with Morocco, rejecting the Polisario version.",
            "Moroccan historiography links Bassiri to the Ejército de Liberación, a Moroccan guerrilla group that infiltrated the Sahara in 1957, connecting it to the Ifni War of 1958.",
            "José Ramón Diego Aguirre, a former intelligence officer in the Spanish Sahara, argues that Bassiri was not an extremist revolutionary and sought collaboration with Spain.",
            "Diego Aguirre states that Bassiri wanted a gradual decolonization leading to a sovereign state, prioritizing Sahrawi representation in the UN.",
            "A police file on Bassiri, opened on February 1, 1969, labels him as a 'dangerous' and 'infiltrated' political figure from Morocco.",
            "A document in Diego Aguirre's archive includes a 1969 'Carta abierta del pueblo saharaui al Gobernador General' which stated rejection of annexation to any neighboring nation, be it east, west, north or south.",
            "The document mentions events in 1969, specifically Morocco's recognition of Mauritania and the handover of Ifni by Spain to Morocco, causing unease among the Sahrawi population.",
            "Spanish military analysts feared a Moroccan conspiracy could exploit social unrest to justify a military intervention, reminiscent of the Ejército de Liberación in 1957.",
            "Colonial authorities believed the Sahrawi population feared being abandoned by Spain and preferred Spanish presence over Moroccan annexation.",
            "The interrogation records of Bassiri and Sidahamed Uld Embarc Rahal confirmed their commitment to Sahrawi nationalism and their belief that Morocco was the main threat.",
            "Spanish colonial documents show that, despite early fears, authorities concluded that OALS was not working against Spain but trying to prevent Moroccan annexation.",
            "In June 1970, military analysts said OALS didn't have immediate independence as the objective but fear that Spain would abandon them."
