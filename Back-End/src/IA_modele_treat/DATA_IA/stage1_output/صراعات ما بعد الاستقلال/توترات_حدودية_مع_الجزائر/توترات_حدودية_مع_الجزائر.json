It highlights that both countries have been unilaterally fortifying their common land border, which has been officially closed since 1994. The abstract attributes this fortification to regional rivalry and political differences that prevent a collaborative approach to border control. It suggests that while both countries are fortifying the border, their specific objectives and priorities differ. The central argument is that this fortification reflects regional competition and serves to maintain the current Maghreb subsystem.",

It argues that the newly independent nations of the Maghrib inherited political problems, particularly concerning frontiers, from their former imperial ruler, France. The Algerian government's position was to claim ownership of all territories previously controlled by the French administration of colonial Algeria, which conflicted with the historical claims of Morocco and Tunisia. The article suggests that French colonial policies were largely responsible for the divisive border issue in North Africa, complicated by varying concepts of statehood and long-standing historical problems. The text also notes that when France conquered Algiers, they didn't plan to take all of Algeria, and that there was no clear concept of an Algerian state or consciousness.",

It argues that various actors, including the FLN, the French, and Islamist groups, used violence and terror to achieve their political objectives. The paper details the historical context of each conflict, including the French colonization of Algeria, the Sétif massacre of 1945, the rise of the FLN, and the cancellation of the 1991 elections that triggered the Civil War. It also discusses the tactics employed by insurgent and counterinsurgent groups, such as guerrilla warfare, ratissage, regroupement, and the use of torture. The role of external actors and the internationalization of the conflict are also addressed, particularly in relation to the French bombing of Sakiet Sidi Youcef in Tunisia and the FLN's attacks in France. The paper concludes that while violence and terror were effective in some cases, such as the FLN's achievement of independence, they were not always successful and often led to unintended consequences, such as the polarization of the Algerian population and the escalation of violence.",

The study identifies key players including state institutions like border police and customs, and informal actors like smugglers and lookouts. The article suggests the state negotiates the leeway given to these informal actors. The research is based on multi-site fieldwork conducted in Algeria (Tébessa, Al-Ouenza, Bir El Ater, M’Daourouch) and Tunisia (Kasserine Governorate), involving interviews with citizens, smugglers, and state officials.",

          "source_summary": "This report by Matt Herbert for the Migration Policy Institute, published in March 2022, examines the challenges of coordinating border management assistance between Europe and the Maghreb (Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia). It focuses on the dynamics of irregular migration, transnational threats, and the impediments to securing the region's borders. The report highlights the different perspectives between European and Maghrebi policymakers on irregular migration, with Maghreb states viewing it as less of a security threat and more as a solution to economic issues. It details European cooperation with the Maghreb on border security, including counterterrorism initiatives and efforts to reduce irregular migration, often implemented bilaterally. The report underscores the importance of addressing the underlying drivers of border insecurity and recognizing the political exigencies linked to border issues. Specifically regarding Algeria, the report highlights Algeria's extensive borders, its significant military deployment to border areas to counter terrorism and illicit trafficking since 2013, its use of drones for surveillance and targeting, and the construction of walls along its borders with several countries including Morocco, Mali, Niger, Libya and Tunisia. It also mentions the long-standing political tensions between Algeria and Morocco, which have led to the closure of their border and stymied cooperation on border security, with only infrequent, low-level communication between border security commanders. Furthermore the document details that migration patterns shifted beginning in late 2017 with increased Algerian departures due to violence in Libya and economic and social frustrations, and notes that Algerian departures occur directly from their origin shores. It notes that while transit migration occurs across Algeria toward Morocco (and Tunisia), few transit migrants depart from Algeria to Europe, and that while the country criminalizes arms smuggling, drug trafficking, and transnational terrorism, the degree of enforcement differs significantly based on the type of cross-border challenge.",
          "extracted_key_facts": [
            "The report examines border security challenges in the Maghreb, including Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia.",
            "The Maghreb has been a key origin and transit point for irregular migration to Europe for decades.",
            "European policymakers see cooperation with the Maghreb as important due to rising Maghrebi departures during the COVID-19 pandemic and instability in Libya and the Sahel.",
            "Maghrebi governments are ambivalent about irregular migration, viewing it as a means for their populations to access better economic opportunities.",
            "European cooperation with the Maghreb has focused on counterterrorism initiatives and efforts to reduce irregular migration to Europe.",
            "Spain has taken the lead in cooperating with Morocco, while Italy is a key interlocuter with Tunisia.",
            "The report suggests that successful cooperation on border security requires Europe to make compromises to meet Maghrebi interests, such as providing visa liberalization or labor migration opportunities.",
            "The European focus on Maghrebi border security is likely to increase due to economic difficulties, social unrest, and political tensions.",
            "Maghreb states' borders are origin points and key transit zones for irregular migrants and drug traffickers, with terrorist groups also operating across the region.",
            "European states have implemented programs to help Maghrebi nations develop more robust border security systems.",
            "Since 2017, irregular migration routes have shifted significantly, leading to heightened sensitivities regarding migration in the Maghreb.",
            "Irregular migration from the region to Europe in the early 2000s largely involved Algerians, Moroccans, and Tunisians moving directly to Europe by sea.",
            "Transit migration, primarily involving sub-Saharan Africans, became a significant issue for Morocco (but not Algeria or Tunisia) in the early 2000s.",
            "By the early 2010s, most Algerian and Moroccan irregular migrants traveled via third countries, such as Turkey and Libya.",
            "Beginning in late 2017, Tunisian irregular migration surged due to the growing economic crisis and political gridlock in the country.",
            "Between 2017 and 2021, Maghrebi irregular migrants increasingly embarked directly from their origin countries toward European shores due to the COVID-19 pandemic.",
            "Governments tend to view the emigration of their citizens as a solution to economic issues and social tensions.",
            "Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia generally do not view migrants from outside the region as a domestic security challenge but don't view their transit as beneficial to social stability.",
            "Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia have gradually focused more on managing their borders and dealing with transnational issues, such as terrorism, illicit arms and drug trafficking, and irregular migration.",
            "Transnational terrorism is the dominant preoccupation of the Moroccan, Algerian, and Tunisian governments and drives border security efforts in the region.",
            "Algeria and Tunisia have experienced sporadic large-scale terrorist raids from Libya, and far southern Algeria has witnessed a recent uptick in terrorist cross-border movement to and from Mali.",
            "Commodity smuggling, the irregular cross-border movement of goods such as petrol, is widespread across the region's borders and is a mainstay of borderland populations' livelihoods.",
            "Absent external pressure, Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia address irregular migration as akin to cross-border commodity smuggling and do not view enforcement as a high priority.",
            "Governments across the Maghreb take heavily militarized approaches to countering terrorist infiltration.",
            "Maghrebi states tolerate significant cross-border smuggling and irregular migration partly because of the need to ensure political stability in economically marginalized regions.",
            "The length and remoteness of the region's borders is an impediment to effective regional border security.",
            "Algeria's frontier is the region's longest, stretching for 6,734 kilometers.",
            "To reduce the stresses on security and defense forces patrolling land frontiers, all three states have constructed various types of walls.",
            "Algeria has built the most elaborate series of fortifications, which cover significant stretches along the country's borders with Morocco, Mali, Niger, Libya, and Tunisia.",
            "The difficulty of coordinating the various security and defense forces tasked with border security at a national level is an impediment to effective border security.",
            "Uneven coordination among Maghrebi states also hinders efforts to buttress border security.",
            "Coordination between Tunisia and Algeria is generally good at several levels, while longstanding political tensions between Morocco and Algeria have led to the border's long-term closure and stymie efforts to coordinate border security.",
            "Insufficient equipment, especially surveillance systems, is an impediment to effective border security.",
            "Corruption among security personnel posted to the frontiers is an impediment to effective border security.",
            "The governments of Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia struggle to offer youth in marginalized zones and border areas the economic opportunities and services they demand which impacts political will to enforce border security.",
            "Curbing irregular migration has been the European Union's and its Member States' longstanding enforcement objective and was key in driving the bloc's outreach to Tunisia and Morocco on border security issues in the 1990s.",
            "Terrorism is another key concern for the European Union and its Member States, with efforts to harden borders to counter the movement of terrorists and foreign fighters continuing since the early 2000s.",
            "The most significant operational coordination exists between Morocco and Spain.",
            "Coordination and cooperation with European states are more limited in Algeria and Tunisia.",
            "While European cooperation with the Maghreb has produced results on counterterrorism, the results on combating irregular migration are more mixed.",
            "Key to the success of European-Maghrebi cooperation against terrorism is the shared view that terrorism poses a major national security threat for states on both sides of the Mediterranean.",
            "Maghrebi states view the issue of irregular migration as less of a priority, particularly compared to the risk of instability and potential social unrest arising from crackdowns at the border.",
            "Economic, social, and governance challenges have grown in Maghrebi states, leading to heightened tolerance for Maghrebi nationals' irregular migration.",
            "Visa liberalization expectations by Maghrebi governments predicated on migration cooperation have gone largely unmet.",
            "Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia periodically take action against their nationals attempting to migrate irregularly, although doing so is more politically challenging for the three governments.",
            "The report suggests three key lessons for policymakers: Migration and border security are now more politically salient in the Maghreb, border security is not a zero-sum issue, and development efforts should complement security programs.",
            "The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored both the potential and the challenges around border security in the Maghreb.",
            "Ultimately, the Maghreb's cooperation on migration issues boils down to the reality that the three governments prioritize regime stability over international relations.",
            "The report was commissioned for the Transatlantic Council on Migration, an initiative of the Migration Policy Institute (MPI), with support from the Government of Australia."

It highlights Algeria's role as a key actor in the region and its complex relationship with border security. The report notes Algeria's attempts to act as the main power holder, its strong anti-terrorism stance, and its reluctance to cooperate regionally due to concerns about maintaining control and influence. The tension between Algeria and Morocco over Western Sahara is identified as a major obstacle to regional cooperation. The report also mentions Algeria's increased security presence and surveillance in the south due to the conflict in Mali and the potential for it to spill over into Algeria. It discusses the porous nature of Algeria's borders, especially in desert regions, and the involvement of transnational networks such as the Tuareg and AQIM in cross-border activities. The report also details the smuggling of goods like cigarettes and drugs through Algeria, with provincial officials potentially involved in illegal sales to neighboring countries.",

Algeria backs the Polisario Front's claim to Western Sahara, challenging Morocco's sovereignty. The United States' role has evolved from supporting Spain to advocating self-determination and later tilting towards Morocco, balancing its relationships with both countries. The article also addresses underlying tensions between Algeria and Tunisia, rooted in historical, ideological, and economic factors, especially post-Arab Spring. It examines the colonial roots of these tensions, highlighting the different experiences under French rule and the subsequent economic asymmetries. Post-2011, border security, regional conflicts, and migration have intensified pressures. Despite these tensions, pragmatic cooperation is maintained due to shared interests. The US aims to balance relations with both countries, navigating counterterrorism objectives and regional stability. The article concludes by emphasizing the intricacies of geopolitics in North Africa and the need for sustained diplomacy to address the Western Sahara dispute and foster reconciliation between Algeria and Tunisia.",

While the article's primary focus is broader than just border tensions with Algeria, it provides specific details related to this topic. The article discusses Algeria's security doctrine which took shape during the War of Liberation and the early years of independence, influenced by the border dispute with Morocco, particularly the \"Sand War\" of 1963. The article further explains the continuous influence of Algerian-Moroccan relations on Algerian security doctrine and the Maghrebi regional system, especially after the Western Sahara conflict broke out in 1975. Events such as Morocco's surveillance of Algerian public figures' cell phones and Algeria's subsequent severing of diplomatic ties and airspace closure to Morocco in 2021 are discussed as examples that strained relations with Morocco remains a foundational element of Algerian security doctrine. The article also addresses how security developments in the Maghreb-Sahel region have tested the principle of non-interference/non-intervention within Algerian security doctrine, particularly concerning the Libyan and Malian crises. The tension between ethical-normative considerations and security imperatives since 2011, Algeria's approach to the Mali crisis where it supported French military intervention, and the implications of constitutionalizing the army's participation in peacekeeping operations. The article further elaborates on Algeria's security strategy in the region, which is a cooperative approach with integrated dimensions, operational measures to protect its borders and bilateral and cooperative political security with neighboring states as an alternative to foreign intervention. The concept of regionalizing Algerian national security is also discussed, focusing on the importance of territorial integrity and sovereignty of neighboring states.",

It uses case studies from Europe and North Africa, including the Western Sahara, to examine the interplay between migration flows, grassroots solidarity, and the challenges faced by migrants and activists. It provides insights into the changing landscape of migration and the role of solidarity in resisting exclusionary regimes. While it doesn't directly address 'توترات حدودية مع الجزائر' (Border Tensions with Algeria), the book's inclusion of the Western Sahara as a case study makes it relevant because the Algeria-Western Sahara border is a known area where tensions and disputes have occurred.

The document highlights how Morocco's advancements have heightened tensions with Algeria, which sees itself as the 'protector' of the Western Sahara independence movement (Polisario). The analysis covers the historical context of Algeria's influence, its decline, and its recent efforts to re-engage with Africa under President Tebboune. The document also explains Morocco's economic expansion in Sub-Saharan Africa and its implications for Algeria, and how this rivalry plays out in security alliances and within African Union institutions, particularly concerning the Western Sahara. It specifically mentions border closures between Morocco and Algeria impacting economic interaction, and the potential for direct confrontation between Morocco and the Polisario related to transport routes. The document considers Tunisia's attempts to catch up with Morocco and the EU's role in promoting positive dynamics and mitigating the negative aspects of the rivalry.",

During Nikita Khrushchev's visit to the UN, he embraced Belkacem Krim, foreign minister of the Gouvernement Provisoire de la République Algérienne (GPRA), confirming de facto recognition and pledging aid. Ferhat Abbas, president in Beijing, requested Chinese volunteers. US President Dwight D.

It details how borders, historically a source of protection, have become vulnerable due to transnational actors exploiting them for profit and sanctuary. The report highlights the long-standing issue of smuggling, which has evolved from mainly involving food and fuel to include drugs, weapons, and human trafficking. Terrorist groups benefit from this contraband economy, leveraging corruption and porous borders. The report points to the failure of the Arab Maghreb Union (AMU) due to political tensions between Algeria and Morocco, particularly concerning the Western Sahara, which has hindered security coordination. The Algerian-Moroccan border has been closed for twenty years, while the Algerian-Tunisian border remains open, facilitating informal trade. The report further discusses the challenges posed by the Libyan and Malian borders, the impact of the Libyan revolution on arms smuggling, and the emergence of new travelers, including terrorists and smugglers, exploiting old routes. The report notes the presence of terrorist groups like AQIM, their shift towards regional strategies, and their exploitation of weak state capacity and radicalized border populations. The report concludes with recommendations for strengthening border management, emphasizing regional context, strategic thinking, tailored solutions, trust-building, technical capacity enhancement, information sharing, community engagement, and anti-corruption measures.",

          "source_summary": "This policy brief discusses the growing number of sub-Saharan African migrants in Algeria and Morocco and the potential for radicalization due to poor socio-economic conditions and discrimination. It examines the migration routes, the economic factors attracting migrants, and the legalisation schemes implemented by both countries. The brief highlights rising racism and marginalisation against migrants, while also acknowledging positive initiatives aimed at their integration. It also addresses the political and economic benefits of legalising migrants for Algeria and Morocco, including improved relations with Sub-Saharan African countries and enhanced negotiation power with European partners. The paper assesses the risk of migrants being exposed to radicalisation in Algeria and Morocco, given the presence of violent extremist groups like al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and Daesh. It emphasizes that while no sub-Saharan migrant has been significantly implicated in terrorism in the two countries (except for one Chadian incident in 2016), the risk exists. It recommends the two countries to develop migrant-tailored PVE strategies, including putting into operation their regularisation schemes and strengthening bilateral cooperation. The policy brief also notes Algeria's deportations of migrants and recommends that they stop. The document indirectly references border security measures that have contributed to tensions as well as the presence of migrants near borders and the potential for terrorist activity in border regions. These aspects are considered contributing factors for potential border tensions, even though these tensions are not the primary focus of the document.",

It highlights Morocco's growing influence in the region and Algeria's attempts to counter it, particularly in the context of the Western Sahara dispute. The document details Algeria's historical role in supporting anti-colonial movements and its current efforts to maintain influence in the African Union. It also explains Morocco's economic expansion and diplomatic efforts in Sub-Saharan Africa since the rule of King Mohammed VI, and Tunisia's attempts to emulate Morocco's success in engaging with the continent. The analysis examines the institutional power plays within African organizations, security alliances, and economic competition between these countries, particularly focusing on how the Algerian-Moroccan rivalry manifests in the security domain and economic spheres. Furthermore, it considers the limitations of these countries' Africa policies, including societal indifference and resistance in Sub-Saharan Africa. Finally, the article offers recommendations for the EU to promote positive dynamics through trilateral cooperation and address potential negative side effects of European policies in the Maghreb.",

It examines the history of migration in the Sahara, the governance of irregular migration by Algerian authorities, and the role of informal institutions in regulating human smuggling along the borders with Niger and Mali. The thesis highlights the securitization of migration, the instrumentalization of migration for political gain, and the dynamics of migrant pathways, particularly the role of 'foyers' (lodging places) in Tamanrasset. The research emphasizes the importance of understanding the drivers, functionalities, and institutions that govern irregular migration and human smuggling in southern Algeria. The text emphasizes the border tensions with Niger and Mali. The study analyzes the governance of irregular migration, the politics of smuggling, and how these factors influence cross-border movement and the lives of migrants. The key focus is on how the unwritten rules governing smuggling operations are shaped and evolve, especially in the context of border security and the state's approach to migration.

            "The study is based on the assumption that the border dynamics and security concerns influence the rules for the human smuggling economy to function in the country.",
            "The study demonstrates how these elements of the migration economy function, particularly with the unwritten rules in each of the border locations such as Tinzaouatine, Timiaouine, and Bordj Badji Mokhtar, thereby directly impacting the border dynamics."

It explores the political, cultural, and social tensions arising from this colonization and the ways in which successive French regimes used Algeria to legitimize their rule. The book delves into the motivations behind French expansion in North Africa, linking it to the contests over sovereignty and male citizenship in France following the Atlantic revolutions. It also details the recruitment of European emigrants as settlers in Algeria and the cultural impact of the \"Armée d'Afrique\".

The document specifically mentions minor border clashes between Morocco and Algeria but states they have not had major military significance. It details military spending, arms imports, and manpower of each country, providing data up to 2005. The report highlights Morocco's conflict with the Polisario, supported by Algeria, in the Western Sahara, shaping Morocco's military force trends. It discusses the Algerian Civil War and its impact on Algerian military modernization.

It covers various factors contributing to desert locust outbreaks and plagues, including lack of funding and training, weak regional organizations, and remote terrain. However, it emphasizes that armed conflict is the most significant obstacle. The article details specific instances of armed conflict in countries with key breeding areas, including Algeria, Chad, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, India-Pakistan, Libya, Mali and Niger, Mauritania, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Western Sahara and Yemen, and their impact on locust control. It also discusses potential solutions such as desert locust strike forces and assistance to rebel armies, while acknowledging the political complexities involved. The article concludes by suggesting the use of remote sensing and the development of contingency plans, highlighting the need for adaptability and flexibility in addressing the challenges posed by armed conflict to desert locust control.",

            "Military skirmishes and terrorism over Kashmir, along the India-Pakistan border, have occurred between 1986 and 2002, limiting cooperation on locust control.",

This shift included increased reliance on military force to manage disputes, a diminished commitment to non-intervention in other countries' domestic affairs, and a change in Algeria's role in the regional security complex. The article notes that these changes, while reflecting broader trends in the MENA region, have distinctive Algerian characteristics. The article suggests that Algeria's posture towards surrounding states has become more confrontational, with decision-makers more frequently resorting to armed forces to address conflicts and threats, and the country stands at the nexus of a MENA regional security complex and an interstate conflict zone.",

It also highlights the chronic crisis with Morocco over the latter's annexation of the Western Sahara in 1975, impacting regional stability and Algeria's foreign policy. The document analyzes Algeria's economic predicament (dependence on oil revenues, declining reserves, and austerity measures), its political stalemate (succession issues, the power of the 'deep state,' and a disconnect between the elite and the population), and its international and security dilemmas (tensions with Morocco, the Western Sahara dispute, and the spillover of regional conflicts). The document details Algeria's reaction to regional instability, including its security initiatives and the exclusion of Morocco, thereby increasing tensions between the two states. It concludes with a bleak outlook, anticipating continued political stasis and the need for economic modernization and genuine democratic governance, emphasizing the importance of resolving the Western Sahara conflict to improve Algeria's diplomatic and security standing.",

While not solely focused on border tensions with Algeria, the text does address issues directly related to such tensions, especially in the context of the Western Sahara conflict and counterterrorism efforts. It argues that stability in the region is crucial for U.S. interests, especially in containing terrorism and ensuring maritime security. It highlights potential threats and challenges, including the resurgence of the Western Sahara conflict between Morocco and the Algeria-backed Polisario Front, which could distract from counterterrorism cooperation. The document also discusses U.S. relations with each country individually, suggesting ways to strengthen ties and address shared concerns, including security assistance to Tunisia for border control with Algeria, encouraging counterterrorism cooperation between Algeria and its neighbors, and navigating the Western Sahara dispute, which is relevant to Algerian-Moroccan border dynamics. It emphasizes the need to de-escalate tensions in the Sahara region to prevent it from undermining regional security and diverting attention from counterterrorism efforts.",

It examines Algeria's past involvement in negotiations on the Northern question in Mali since the 1990s, the deterioration of Algeria's influence due to tensions with former Malian President Amadou Toumani Touré (ATT), and accusations that Algerian intelligence services fueled regional tensions. It highlights the shift in Mali's stance towards Algeria's role in resolving the crisis, particularly after President Ibrahim Boubakar Keita's visit to Algiers in January 2014. The article also mentions France's support for Algerian mediation and the collaboration between France and Algeria in counterterrorism operations, including the stopping and killing of terrorists near Tinzaouatine (Tamanrasset) in May 2014. Furthermore, it discusses Algeria's concerns about the destabilization of Southern Mali due to uprisings in the North, as well as the potential alliances with Libyan General Khalifa Haftar and Egyptian President Abdel Fatah Al Sisi. The article mentions the pressure exerted by France on Bamako to start negotiations with rebel groups in the North after one year of inaction and the escape of Islamist militants from a jail in Bamako. Finally, it elaborates on Algeria's initiation of discussions and negotiations in Algiers in January 2014, involving various regional actors, and its use of the inter-Malian talks as a model for the Libyan national dialogue and reconciliation process. While the primary focus is on Algeria's role in Mali, the text also hints at the interplay of these dynamics with Algeria's border regions and security concerns, indirectly addressing the broader theme of \"توترات حدودية مع الجزائر\".",

The document emphasizes how the reorganization of African migration is affected by border and police controls, contributing to the perpetuation of transit spaces.

          "source_summary": "This research report, titled \"The Libyan Migration Corridor,\" examines the complexities of migration through Libya, particularly focusing on sub-Saharan Africans attempting to reach Europe. While the document primarily discusses migration patterns, economic impacts on transit areas, and EU-Libya cooperation on border control, it also indirectly addresses border tensions through its analysis of migration policies, border closures, and the shifting dynamics of regional relations. It describes how migration routes have been influenced by border controls implemented by Algeria and Libya and how new diplomatic relations affected those patterns. It also discusses the CENSAD agreement and its limited success in facilitating free movement of people. The paper highlights the political and economic factors influencing migration, including conflicts, economic discrepancies, and stricter migratory policies. Therefore, although it doesn't focus specifically on \"توترات حدودية مع الجزائر,\" it covers relevant aspects like regional border policy, the impact of those policies, and relevant historical context of migratory policies in the region and the relationships of states in the Sahara-Sahel area, including Algeria.",
          "extracted_key_facts": [
            "Since the 1990s, Libya exemplifies how multilateral (EU-Maghreb) or bilateral (Libya-Italy, Libya-Malta…) political negotiations between the two shores of the Mediterranean Sea rapidly focused on the figure of the ‘illegal sub-Saharan migrant in transit.",
            "In 2005, two-thirds of the 22,824 African migrants who reached Italy came from Egypt, Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia.",
            "Increased regional economic discrepancies, political troubles in Africa, and tougher migratory policies increased migratory flows from both North and South of the Sahara.",
            "Routes between Niger, Chad, Sudan, and Libya diversified due to the new political and economic situation, perpetuating transit spaces.",
            "Since the 2000s, Libya implemented a repressive migration policy leading to a decrease in the quality of life for long-established migrants, and some were led to leave the country.",
            "During the fifties and sixties, new worker migrants from the most remote regions of the Sahel sought employment in the building industry, and on Libyan and Algerian oil production sites.",
            "During the 1970s and 1980s, drought cycles affected shepherd livestock in the Sahelian arid margins (Sudanese Darfur, Lake Chad…), leading to increased migration; it's estimated that one in five families had a family member working in Libya during this time.",
            "During this period, conflict increased between central states and minorities in the Sahel, the number of refugees increased: nearly 140,000 Sahrawis and more than 50,000 Malian and Nigerien Tuaregs settled in border camps in Algeria (Bisson, 2003).",
            "Libya was concerned both by the arrival of Nigerien Tuaregs and that of tens of thousands of Tubu refugees and repatriated Libyans who settled in all Saharan towns during the Chad war (1973-1994).",
            "Since 2001, pressure from Europe on North African countries seen as transit countries led to an increasing number of multilateral meetings (5+5) and bilateral negotiations (Spain-Morocco, and Italy-Libya).",
            "Tolerance exhibited by Libyan authorities in regard to sub-Saharan migrants in periods of labor shortages continues to alternate with periods of arrests and expulsions (Spiga, 2005; Bredeloup, Zongo, 2005).",
            "Between Niger, Chad, and Libya, only nationals have the right of passage, and Algeria is enforcing ever more drastic controls.",
            "The Libyan Sudanese border has been locked down since 2003 due to the deterioration of the conflict in Darfur.",
            "In 2003, 40% of the area in the Libyan hub of Sabha had neighborhoods inhabited by either refugees or migrants.",
            "In the early 2000s, Libyan authorities used a precarious workforce to have villas built at inexpensive prices in Tripoli’s well-off areas, as well as secondary houses throughout the country.",
            "In 2005 after Colonel Gaddafi renegotiated an agreement with the European Union, the 40th Street in Sabha, a boomin neighbourhood and must-go stop-off for Africans in transit, had lost its appeal and most of the shops linked to transit economy closed down.",
            "In the 1990s, Libya and six other African states created the Community of Sahel-Saharan States (CENSAD), with one objective being the free movement of people, capital, and interests for citizens of all CENSAD member states.",
            "In autumn 2000, 130 Sub-Saharan migrants died during anti-African riots in Tripoli and Zawiya, Northern Libya.",
            "In 2007, Joint operations between Libya, Italy and Malta started, but the bilateral agreement between Libya and Italy was only signed in August 2008.",
            "In June 2010, Libya expelled the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), with whom 9,000 refugees and 4,000 asylum-seekers were registered.",
            "During a visit to Rome on August 31st, 2010, Colonel Gaddafi suggested that the European Union appoint him guardian of European borders in order to reduce migration flows and prevent the rise of a ‘Black Europe’ in exchange for 5 billion Euros a year.",
            "In 2005, migrants stormed Ceuta and Melilla, there was in increase in migration figures to Lampedusa and Malta in the North, and to the Canary Islands in the South",
            "During the Libyan conflict of 2011, the situation of African migrants in Libya was highly jeopardized, with many Libyan civilians confusing the bulk of immigrants with those militia members."

The report highlights that since 2011, local and regional protests about socio-economic issues have occurred, but Algeria was not as affected by the Arab Spring as neighboring countries. The Algerian government prevented escalation of protests through economic measures, while Algeria's history and regional conflict discouraged violent protests. Key drivers and potential drivers of conflict are Islamist terrorist groups (AQIM and MUJAO), trafficking and kidnapping, protests, tensions in the Sahrawi camps in Tindouf, and economic and political factors. Current conflict mostly occurs in the north, but is increasing in the south and along the borders with Tunisia and Libya. The Libyan conflict increased the availability of weapons for AQIM, leading to increased conflict-related fatalities. The Algerian government has taken a hard-line approach against terrorism, but this strategy has seen limited success due to a lack of cooperation with neighboring countries and due to the changing nature of the threat. Terrorist groups obtain weapons from various sources, including Morocco, Libya, and Mali. The Algerian government also faces challenges related to economic distribution, unemployment, and corruption. The political system is highly centralised, with the military and intelligence services wielding significant power. Socio-political tensions exist among Berbers, Tuaregs, and Sahrawi refugees. The report makes practical recommendations, including ceasing ransom payments, increasing regional cooperation, supporting economic diversification, avoiding short-term focus on counterterrorism, and deepening economic integration in the Sahel-Sahara region.",

It argues that Algeria has used these actors to weaken Morocco's position on Western Sahara and reshape its foreign policy decisions. The paper highlights the historical context of the Western Sahara dispute, the involvement of Algeria in supporting the Polisario Front, and the geopolitical and economic dimensions of the conflict. It also analyzes the relationship between Morocco and Algeria in relation to the Western Sahara issue, focusing on Algeria's intervention in Morocco's domestic affairs. The paper further examines the role of the OAU and the UN in addressing the conflict, including the ceasefire in 1991 and the various proposed settlement plans. It also delves into the influence of interest groups, such as the Algerian oil company Numhyd, in shaping the political landscape and impacting Morocco's decision to leave the OAU. The paper concludes by emphasizing the need for negotiation, persuasion, and compromise to resolve the Western Sahara crisis and promote stability in the North African region. It also touches upon the potential for strategic partnerships between Morocco and Algeria to foster a sustainable peace process.",

The report also details Algeria's efforts to combat terrorism, including deploying troops to the Saharan provinces and along its borders with Mali, Niger, and Mauritania to counter Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), as well as its cooperation with neighboring countries to address regional security concerns. The report highlights the challenges of illegal immigration and smuggling across Algeria's borders, issues directly related to security, and mentions the Trans-Saharan pipeline project, impacting regional cooperation and security. Finally, the report describes the efforts of the Algerian state to cooperate with the United States to secure the Sahel region.

          "source_summary": "This document, published in October 2006, explores the perspectives of Algerians on regional integration within the Arab Maghreb Union (AMU). It highlights the perceived stagnation of the Maghreb due to a democratic deficit and the ongoing tensions between Algeria and Morocco, exacerbated by the Western Sahara conflict. The document details the historical context of Maghreb unity, the creation and shortcomings of the AMU, and the economic challenges facing the region. It also analyses the views of Algerians on the possibility of war with Morocco, the need for democracy, and the roles of external actors like the EU and the US in promoting regional integration. The document suggests that regional integration is hindered by a lack of trust and political will among North African rulers, and the unresolved Western Sahara issue serves as a pretext for maintaining hostile relations. A survey conducted in Algeria in July-August 2006 reveals a strong desire for a North African parliament and greater regional cooperation, but also widespread disappointment with the AMU's progress. The document examines the potential for economic integration through initiatives like free trade agreements and the Euro-Mediterranean gas pipeline, while also acknowledging the competing interests and rivalries between Algeria, Libya, and other countries in the region. Ultimately, the document emphasizes the need for democratization and improved relations between Algeria and Morocco to achieve meaningful regional integration.",

It highlights the increasing complexity of air security due to technological advancements, unconventional threats like drones and cyberattacks, and regional conflicts. The article mentions specific examples relevant to Algeria, such as the country closing its airspace during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and Algeria closing its airspace to Moroccan aircraft due to \"recent security tensions\". Although the primary focus is on general air sovereignty challenges, the explicit mention of Algeria and Morocco in the context of airspace closure due to security tensions makes this source directly relevant to the topic of border tensions with Algeria.",

It analyzes the impact of newspapers, telegraphs, cinema newsreels, and radio on Algerian identity, pan-Islamism, and resistance to French colonialism. The review highlights how the French colonial administration implemented discriminatory laws, such as the *indigénat* of 1881, to control and censor 'Muslim newspapers' and restrict the freedom of expression of native Algerians. The introduction of telegraph lines connected Algeria to France and the world, which allowed Algerians to connect with other Muslims, fostering pan-Islamic sentiments and challenging French authority. The book also examines the emergence of internationalist political movements among Algerians during events such as the Spanish Civil War and the Italian invasion of Libya. The review concludes by discussing the role of modern media in creating both imagined communities and divisions within Algerian society.",

            "Telegraph lines connected Algeria to France and the world.",

It outlines the historical context of U.S. relations with each country, focusing on key events, perceptions, and challenges. Regarding Algeria, the document mentions its role in regional mediation (e.g., between Ethiopia and Eritrea, and in Mali), its importance in U.S. geostrategic and economic interests (particularly in counter-terrorism), and the challenges in balancing relations with Algeria and Morocco due to strained relations between the two countries. The document also touches upon Algeria's foreign policy principles that sometimes put it at odds with the U.S. It notes Algeria's hesitance to embrace U.S. development programs and the powerful Algerian military and intelligence apparatus's skepticism towards an American presence. The document also refers to tensions between Morocco and Algeria, the Western Sahara dispute and its impact on regional cooperation and specifically on counter-terrorism, and how Algeria, Morocco and the Polisario Front reject all proposals for resolving this issue. General Rodriguez's (AFRICOM) view of Algeria as a regional leader in addressing transnational security threats is mentioned. It also points out the potential for deeper cooperation with Algeria on trade, intelligence, counter-terrorism, and military action, while respecting Algeria's sovereignty concerns. The document notes how the U.S. prioritizes counter-terrorism and how it overshadows democracy promotion, democratization and human rights in Algeria. In summary, the document highlights the complexities of U.S. relations with Algeria and how these relationships are influenced by regional dynamics, including tensions with its neighbors.",

It challenges the classical realist school's focus on geopolitical and military-strategic terms, arguing that economic factors are central to understanding the diplomacy of African states, particularly Algeria. The article suggests that African states operate within a global system dominated by the economic power of others, shaped by colonial-era structures, and explores how these states confront or accommodate the external economic environment. It also references several events and publications relevant to Algerian politics and foreign policy, including Algeria's role in OPEC and its relationship with Palestinian organizations. While the article doesn't explicitly focus on border tensions with Algeria's neighbors, the discussion of Algeria's foreign policy orientation and African policy indirectly relates to the dynamics that may influence border relations.",

The article focuses on archival collections at the Modern Records Centre, including papers of Labour MPs, records of the TUC, and materials from socialist and Trotskyist groups. It argues that these collections are crucial for understanding the influence of the Algerian war on British conceptions of socialism and highlights the importance of transnational archives in understanding processes of domination and liberation during decolonization.",

It discusses the political and economic situation in the Maghreb region after the 2011 revolts, focusing on the rise of insecurity, social unrest, civil conflicts, and terrorist groups linked to international Islamic jihadism. It highlights the targeting of industrial oil facilities in rentier states like Libya and Algeria. The Algerian case is particularly interesting due to the 2013 attack on the In Amenas gas plant, which demonstrated the serious effects of terrorist attacks, considering both domestic and regional factors. The study provides a reflection on the geopolitical context of the Maghreb area and supports interdisciplinary security risk assessment studies dedicated to process facilities. Although the text doesn't explicitly discuss border tensions, it mentions the attack in In Amenas (near the border with Libya) and the regional security context, which are relevant as border tensions could be related to the security challenges in the Maghreb region.",

Algeria supports the Sahrawi population's right to self-determination, while Morocco considers the Western Sahara as part of its territory, a position strengthened after Spain's withdrawal in 1976. The document details Algeria's financial support for the Polisario Front and the Sahrawi refugees due to its oil revenues, especially between 1973 and the mid-1980s, and the consequent military expenditures by Morocco to maintain control over the Western Sahara. It also mentions attempts at reconciliation, such as the meeting between President Bouteflika and King Mohamed VI in 2005, which ultimately failed due to disagreements over the Sahara issue. The paper explains how the conflict has served both countries' nationalistic agendas, enabling them to consolidate power and deflect from internal issues. Furthermore, it highlights the economic implications, including the stagnation of regional integration in the Maghreb and the impact of fluctuating oil prices on Algeria's ability to support its position. The document concludes that although the risk of open war is unlikely, the ongoing tensions and arms race hinder political development and regional cooperation.",

          "source_summary": "This text from the Annuaire de l'Afrique du Nord (1990) discusses the complex relationship between France and the Maghreb, particularly Algeria, focusing on cultural, linguistic, and identity issues. While not directly about border tensions in a military or political sense, it touches on the permeability of borders and the challenges to national identity posed by migration, cultural exchange, and the legacies of colonialism. The text argues that despite the existence of borders and state-level attempts to reinforce them, there is a strong interconnectedness between France and the Maghreb. It explores the myths of return and the difficulties in reconciling historical narratives of separation with the reality of increasing integration. The author analyzes the roles of language, particularly French and Arabic, in shaping identities and negotiating change within this context. The article highlights a tension between technological convergence and ideological divergence, and explores how both French and Algerian societies grapple with the legacies of colonialism and the challenges of integration and national identity in a globalizing world. Although it discusses broader themes, it reflects on the challenges faced at the border and boundaries regarding identity and the flow of information. The article concludes by emphasizing the need for linguistic freedom to enable societies to articulate new identities and integrate past experiences into the present.",

The analysis extends to the Sahel region, where the rivalry continues, particularly in the context of counter-terrorism efforts and the Tuareg issue.

The strategy is guided by non-interference, non-intervention, and endogenous regional security management. The article notes limitations in Algeria's approach, including its state-centric orientation, the rise of non-state actors, terrorist mutations, regional instability, and a lack of strategic convergence. The article discusses the building of border walls by Morocco and Tunisia and Algeria's approach of digging trenches. It also delves into the restructuring of the Algerian military, cooperation with Tunisia and Libya, and the 'countries of the field' initiative as components of the broader border strategy. It analyzes the concept of securitization and its impacts on border control and regional relations and touches on the paradoxical, and persistent incomprehension in Algerian-Moroccan relations despite the relatively stable border.

It examines the evolution of these borders from pre-colonial nomadic structures to colonial Westphalian concepts and contemporary security-driven approaches involving the construction of sand walls. The analysis highlights tensions arising from the imposition of specific border orders and the impact on local populations, especially concerning trade and movement. The article uses the example of Tin Zaouatine on the Algerian-Malian border to illustrate broader trends of border securitization and its consequences on nomadic life and cross-border activities. It mentions incidents of border closures by the Algerian army, leading to protests and casualties, and the construction of a sand wall along Algeria's 6500 km of borders, impacting the livelihoods of border communities. The source also discusses the historical context of the border tracings during the colonial period and how they affect the local Touareg populations.",

While the article primarily discusses freedom of expression, censorship, and the socio-political commentary embedded in the artists' work, it also touches upon the issue of *harraga* (irregular migrants) and how border crossings are represented in Algerian caricatures. The article examines how these cartoons reflect on border issues and the motivations behind Algerian emigration, as well as the Algerian government's policies relating to migration and border control. The study covers historical context of Algerian caricature, and the restrictions put upon the caricaturists.",

It discusses the complexities and lingering effects of the colonial past on contemporary Franco-Algerian relations, including issues of ethnicity, national identity, and the unequal distribution of power and privileges, all of which can contribute to tensions, even if indirectly related to physical borders.

It discusses various threats to Algeria's security, including terrorism, Salafist movements, smuggling networks, drug trafficking, illegal migration, and internal socio-political issues. It examines Algeria's strategies for combating these threats, including military measures, deradicalization policies, and regional cooperation, while emphasizing the transnational nature of security challenges and the need for a common response. The study also assesses the strategic importance of the Sahel region to Algeria due to geographic proximity, cultural ties, and historical links. The analysis extends to the security strategies of Algeria's partners in the region and offers recommendations for improving security in the Maghreb and the Sahel-Saharan region. It highlights that Algeria's security is significantly affected by the stability, or lack thereof, of its neighbors, directly addressing border tensions through the lens of security challenges.",

It outlines the different terms used to define the region (North Africa, Maghreb, Grand Maghreb, MENA), highlighting the ambiguity in its delimitation and the fluctuating relationships between the included states. The creation of the Arab Maghreb Union (UMA) in 1989 is mentioned as an attempt at regional integration, but its progress has been hampered by political tensions, particularly the dispute over the Western Sahara between Morocco and Algeria, leading to the closure of their land border since 1994. The source points out that the most significant relationships are with external partners such as France, the EU, the US, and Gulf powers. Despite the weak 'top-down' integration, the article recognizes 'bottom-up' integration through shared cultural characteristics (Arab identity, Berber identity, language, religion), and human mobility across borders, including the Sahara. The article specifically mentions the political crisis of 1994 between Morocco and Algeria over the Western Sahara, as a primary cause of the UMA being at a standstill, and the closing of the land border between the two countries as a consequence.",

It highlights the increasing restrictiveness of migration policies after Algeria's independence in 1962, moving from relatively free circulation under the Évian Accords to stricter controls, including visa requirements and enhanced border surveillance. The article discusses the Franco-Algerian agreement of 1968 and its subsequent amendments, the establishment of the ONAMO (Office National de la Main d'Oeuvre) to control labor migration, and the impact of events like the 1986 Paris bombings and the Algerian Civil War in the 1990s on visa policies. It also covers the role of the Arenc detention center in Marseille and the increasing involvement of transport companies in migration control. The article argues that the Franco-Algerian border has become an example of the broader trend towards increased migration surveillance in the Mediterranean region, reflecting a fusion of control devices implemented by both countries.",

It examines the discrepancy in visa acceptance rates between the two countries, with Algeria having a significantly higher visa refusal rate compared to China. The study analyzes the Schengen visa as an instrument of differential mobility, questioning the unequal distribution of the freedom to move. Theoretically, it uses the approach of instrumentation, dividing the analysis into four levels: EU policy-making, politico-diplomatic relations, bureaucratic implementation, and public perception. Methodologically, it includes field research at French consulates in Algiers and Beijing, and interviews with French and European decision-makers. The thesis highlights the contradictory aims within the Schengen visa framework, balancing the fight against irregular immigration with economic and diplomatic considerations. In the case of Algeria, the restrictive visa policy is linked to the postcolonial relationship with France, creating a system where visa access is limited but with exceptions for elites. The research reveals the complex layers of mobility regulation under the Schengen visa regime, highlighting inequalities between countries, within countries, and among individuals of the same nationality, ultimately creating distinctions between 'desirable' and 'undesirable' foreigners.",

It discusses how Camus's Algerian identity and experiences influenced his writing, particularly regarding themes of colonialism, identity, and the complex relationship between French and Algerian cultures. The author examines Camus's essays, novels, and unfinished works, exploring how they reflect the tensions and fractures within Algerian society during the colonial period. It also explores Camus' political stances during the Algerian War of Independence, his advocacy for a peaceful resolution, and the complexities of his position as a French Algerian intellectual during a period of intense political and social upheaval.",
          "extracted_key_facts": [
            "Albert Camus's Algerian identity significantly shaped his personality and creative work.",
            "Literary critics like Edward Said have interpreted Camus's Algerian-based novels as reflecting the colonial spirit, a perspective this text challenges.",
            "Camus's writings express a fusion with Mediterranean nature and a feeling of impending exile, reflecting the tragic colonial situation in Algeria.",
            "Camus's narrative texts represent the fractures of Algerian society, differing from colonial ideology.",
            "Camus was born in Mondovi, Algeria, on November 7, 1913.",
            "Camus started his journalism career at Alger républicain, later Soir républicain.",
            "Camus's discourse in Stockholm in 1957 acknowledged his identity as a Frenchman from Algeria.",
            "Camus's attachment to Algeria is evident in his Carnets, where he expresses a strong emotional connection.",
            "His 1958 preface to L’Envers et l’Endroit emphasizes the significance of his Algerian upbringing.",
            "Camus’s unfinished work, Le Premier Homme, intended to revisit and relaunch his work, reflecting on his Algerian origins and the impending end of a world for French Algerians.",
            "Camus's poetic essays celebrate the Mediterranean, particularly the Algerian coast, with themes of carnal connection to nature.",
            "The novel L'Etranger is set in Algeria in the 1930s, reflecting the existential solitude exacerbated by the colonial context.",
            "La Peste, though set in Oran, is a universal allegory, but references to reporting on the Arab population hint at the colonial reality.",
            "In the short story \"La femme adultère,\" the heroine's longing for freedom can be interpreted as a desire to abolish colonial boundaries.",
            "The short story \"L’Hôte\" portrays the moral dilemma of a teacher, Daru, during the Algerian War, reflecting the tensions of the colonial context.",
            "Camus opposed the colonial school of thought and its justification of Western cultural superiority.",
            "Camus supported indigenous Algerian writers, believing they should write in their own voice.",
            "Camus, as a journalist for Alger républicain in 1939, exposed the misery in Kabylie, advocating for a more equitable society.",
            "Camus condemned the repression of the May 1945 Sétif and Guelma demonstrations, advocating for justice for the Arab population of Algeria.",
            "Camus aimed for a solution that allowed both indigenous Algerians and Europeans to coexist peacefully in Algeria.",
            "During the Algerian War, Camus tried to balance his attachment to Algeria with his concern for justice and his condemnation of terrorism, leading to increasing isolation.",
            "Camus remained silent on the Algerian question from 1958 onwards due to the polarization of opinions.",
            "Camus was friends with Emmanuel Roblès, but his relationship with Jean Sénac broke down over political differences relating to the FLN.",
            "Camus envisioned a patrie where Arabs and French would be reconciled in liberty and justice. He articulated this vision in a letter to Aziz Kessous in October 1955.",
            "Camus’s political engagement was also evident in his signing of the Manifeste des intellectuels d’Algérie in favor of the Violette project in May 1937 and his call for a civil truce in Algiers in January 1956. The Violette project aimed to grant easier access to French citizenship for some indigenous Algerians.",
            "Camus died in 1960 and is buried in Lourmarin, France."

The research involved field work in Niamey in December 2017, examining the influence of various actors, the application of law 2015-036 regarding illicit migrant trafficking, and the legal dilemmas arising from it, including its impact on ECOWAS protocols on free movement. The document also covers the perception and rhetoric used by Nigerien authorities regarding migration, including victimizing migrants and justifying repression as a form of protection and as a starting point. It touches upon the issues faced by Nigerien citizens, the criticism of the EU-funded programs, and the legal interpretations used to justify actions related to migration control and border management involving Algeria. Ultimately, the source discusses the relationship between Nigerien authorities, foreign influence, and the efforts to control migration flows into and through Niger, with a specific focus on border control policies impacting movement towards Algeria.",

It highlights the precarious social conditions, weak development prospects, and political challenges facing the country. The document also details internal security threats such as conflicts over natural resources and separatist tendencies, as well as external threats including terrorism and cross-border crime. The paper explores Niger's responses to these challenges, both internally through military and socio-economic strategies, and externally through regional and multilateral cooperation. Specific mention is made of Niger's geographical location between Algeria, Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, Libya, Mali, and Nigeria making it a contact zone between Sub-Saharan and North Africa and thus vulnerable to regional instability. The document analyzes the effectiveness of regional cooperation initiatives and offers recommendations for addressing security concerns at both the national and regional levels. It notes the porous borders of Niger and the influence of instability in neighboring countries like Libya, Mali and Nigeria. The document mentions the role of Algeria in facilitating negotiations between the government and rebel groups. It also touches upon drug trafficking routes from Algeria through Niger.",

It highlights Morocco's initial claims to the 'Moroccanity' of Tindouf following its independence, the tumultuous Algerian acquisition of the area, and the 'War of the Sands' in 1963 between Algeria and Morocco. The article notes a period of eased tensions after the Tlemcen meeting on May 27, 1970, where King Hassan II relinquished claims to Tindouf in exchange for joint exploitation of the Gara-Djebilet iron deposits. The 'Treaty of Ifrane' two years later formally addressed the border demarcation but was only ratified by Algeria.

While it does not directly address border tensions with Algeria, it mentions the closure of land borders between Morocco and Algeria since 1994 due to 'tumultuous relations between Rabat and Alger' as a factor hindering the Arab Maghreb Union (UMA). It focuses on Morocco's migration policies, its engagement with the African Union (AU), and its cooperation with the EU on migration management. It also touches upon the potential for regional integration within the Maghreb, highlighting the economic potential and the obstacles to its realization, including political differences and border closures. The document also discusses the role of externalization in EU migration policy, with the EU relying on countries like Turkey, Libya, and Niger to manage migration flows. It also notes tensions arising between Rabat and Madrid because of increased migration flows to Spain. Therefore, while not the central theme, the document contains tangential but directly relevant information regarding Moroccan-Algerian border issues.",

          "source_summary": "This paper discusses public actions and territorialization in the Algerian Sahara since Algeria's independence in 1962. It analyzes the socio-economic development of the Saharan regions, focusing on the impact of state-led initiatives like administrative reforms, land reforms, and infrastructure development, largely funded by hydrocarbon exports. The study examines how these interventions have reshaped the spatial organization of the region and their consequences on the local population. It also touches on the strategic security dimension related to the Sahara's vast territory and the need to control the borders with Mali, Niger, and Libya. The paper specifically mentions instances of social unrest related to recruitment policies in oil companies in Ouargla and resistance to shale gas exploitation in In Salah in 2014, highlighting spatial inequalities in the distribution of oil wealth that contribute to local discontent. The research also looks at the competition for water resources, particularly in the Touat region, and the limited participation of local authorities in decision-making processes, which can lead to social unrest, especially concerning the exploitation of fossil resources.",

            "The administrative divisions of 1975 and 1984 increased the number of wilayas (departments) from two to seven, leading to increased budgets for equipment construction, housing programs, and road infrastructure.",

            "The 'Caisse du Sud' allocates 2% of oil and gas export profits to Saharan wilayas to address development gaps between the north and south.",
            "Spatial inequality in the distribution of oil wealth between northern and southern regions occasionally fuels discontent, leading to protests.",
            "Manifestations occurred in Ouargla due to recruitment policies in oil companies, and in In Salah in 2014 due to shale gas exploitation.",

            "Local conflict over the location of a secondary school in Founoughile resulted in its placement between two settlements, forcing students to travel long distances daily.",
            "Competition for water resources exists, exemplified by the conflicts arising from the use of traditional 'foggara' systems versus modern pumping for urban and agricultural needs.",
            "Associations of foggara users negotiate for protection and rehabilitation, often blaming the administration for declining water levels due to well drilling since the 1980s.",
            "Tensions exist between populations of slave descent and those considering themselves noble owners of foggaras, with new generations preferring illegal connections to the public water supply.",
            "The state promotes the exploitation of natural resources under the aegis of institutional actors.",

            "Protests in In Salah were triggered by government plans for shale gas extraction, raising concerns about contamination of the Albian aquifer.",
            "Negotiations between central government representatives and social movement leaders resulted in the postponement of shale gas exploration, the promotion of In Salah to a delegated wilaya, and the construction of structured health facilities."

It specifically mentions Algeria's and Mauritania's reluctance regarding military intervention in Mali and Algeria's preference for negotiated solutions involving Islamist groups. It describes the roles of other neighboring countries, such as Burkina Faso, Niger, Senegal, and Guinea, and their contributions to MINUSMA. It also discusses the involvement of neighboring countries in CAR, including Cameroon, Congo Brazzaville, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the controversial role of Chad.

This annexation and the ensuing conflict created tensions with Algeria, thus making the source relevant to the topic of 'توترات حدودية مع الجزائر' (Border Tensions with Algeria). The report also references the treatment of Sahrawi human rights activists by Moroccan authorities.",

It discusses the historical east-west and north-south asymmetriess that lead to friction among the various actors. The article specifically mentions that Algeria and Morocco, the only two initially stable members of the Maghreb, maintain an enconado (heated) conflict due to the question of the Sahara. The Maghreb is then described as bordering the unstable Sahel region, thus implying Algeria and Morocco are also subject to some instability. The article highlights a series of conflicts throughout the Mediterranean such as those in the Balkans, the Greco-Turkish conflict over Cyprus, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The article concludes that a comprehensive approach is needed, addressing both socioeconomic and political-cultural issues to achieve stability in the Mediterranean, with security being a precondition for development.",

It highlights Repsol's oil exploration ventures on both the Spanish and Moroccan sides of the Gibraltar-Atlantic border and the concessions granted to Repsol between the Canary Islands and Morocco, which sparked a strong reaction from Morocco. The text also covers Algeria's offering of oil exploration blocks in what it considers its territorial waters, including a zone in the Alboran Sea, potentially overlapping with Spanish claims. This action by Algeria is viewed as a potential source of tension. The article emphasizes the risks and opportunities associated with these explorations, the importance of clear maritime delimitations, and the need for environmental considerations. It also mentions the involvement of various international oil companies (Conoco, Woodside, RWE Dea AG, Fusion Oil, Premier Oil, Kerr Macgee, and TotalFina) in these explorations.

It argues that Spain has actively transferred its national immigration priorities to the European level, particularly concerning border control and cooperation with countries of origin and transit, such as Morocco, Algeria, and Mauritania. This \"issue transference\" was facilitated by Spain's transformation into a major immigration country and the implementation of the Amsterdam Treaty. While Spain has influenced EU policy, it has also been subject to the dynamics of supranational policy-making. The article examines how Spanish governments, both of the Popular Party (PP) and the Socialist Party (PSOE), have attempted to shape the EU's immigration agenda to address domestic concerns, like the control of irregular immigration and readmission agreements, in the context of migratory pressures from its southern border. It details Spain's efforts to condition development aid on cooperation in migration control and its engagement with the EU to address migrant crises involving Ceuta, Melilla, and the Canary Islands. The article concludes that Europeanization in this area is a two-way process, with Spain both influencing and being influenced by EU policies, and describes the process as interactive, involving adjustment, accommodation, and the 'insemination' of solutions at different policy levels.",

It discusses the strategic importance of Tabarka in the 16th century, its capture by the Spanish Crown, and its subsequent loss to Tunis. The article then focuses on the resettlement of Tabarquinos (people from Tabarka) on the island of Isla Plana, renamed Nueva Tabarca, in the late 18th century. This resettlement was part of a broader Spanish effort to fortify its coast against piracy and contrabanding. The text outlines the planning and construction of the fortified city of Nueva Tabarca, including the challenges faced due to lack of fresh water and resources. It also highlights the roles of key figures like the Conde de Aranda and Fernando Méndez de Rao Sotomayor in the project. The article further delves into the historical context of Spanish coastal defenses and the broader reformist policies of Carlos III. The project ultimately faced numerous difficulties and was deemed a failure despite significant initial investment. The text concludes with the island's decline and eventual loss of military significance.",

It explores how Algeria's foreign policy has been used to restore its international role, manage internal crises, and project a new image.

It also addresses Algeria's approach to international issues like the war in Ukraine and its relations with various global powers, including Spain, Russia, and the EU. The text details Algeria's diplomatic efforts in Africa, the Arab world, and its use of soft power tools like sports, culture, and economic aid to enhance its regional influence. The analysis covers Algeria's foreign policy shifts from the 1960s to the present, influenced by events like the Hirak protests and the changing geopolitical landscape.

The article discusses how, following De Gaulle's change in policy regarding Algeria, elements of the European colonists and military personnel in Algeria violently reacted. After the failure of the \"sublevación de las barricadas\" (barricades uprising) in Algiers in January 1960, some of the leaders fled to Franco's Spain and were received as political refugees. General Raoul Salan, a key opponent of abandoning the military solution in Algeria, moved to Madrid in late October 1960. He was followed by numerous opponents of decolonization. In February 1961, Salan participated in the creation of the Organisation de l'Armée secrète (OAS) in Madrid, which aimed to encourage a military coup to establish a pro-French Algeria government. The article analyzes the organization, activities, and political relationships of the OAS members who took refuge in Spain. It focuses on the Franco regime's attitude toward Salan and the OAS's activities in Spain, arguing that Franco was permissive towards them. The article suggests that Franco, seeking a more favorable government in Paris and misjudging the likelihood of a successful coup against De Gaulle, allowed Salan to fly from Madrid to Algiers, despite the French government's request for Salan to be monitored. The priority of the Spanish government was to obtain measures against Spanish exile organizations from the French government in return for controlling the OAS members. The article is based on a review of existing bibliography and previously unpublished documentation from the Castiella Fund at the Royal Academy of History and the Alicante Provincial Police Station.",

It highlights the historical context of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation, starting from the 1960s, with key milestones like the Barcelona Declaration in 1995 and the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) in 2004. The article analyzes the dynamics and limitations of agricultural trade, noting that while trade has increased, it remains unbalanced, with the EU exporting more to the region than it imports. The piece also identifies factors hindering deeper integration, such as the heterogeneity of Mediterranean countries, persistent power rivalries, protectionist practices, and public opinion. It notes Algeria's position in agricultural trade with the EU, highlighting its relatively limited role as a source of imports to the EU and as a destination for EU agricultural exports. The article further discusses challenges such as food insecurity, climate change, and the need for enhanced cooperation to promote food sovereignty. The closure of the land border between Morocco and Algeria is mentioned as an example of political obstacles impacting economic relationships.",

It highlights that most African migration occurs within the continent, particularly within West Africa. It touches upon the historical context of migration rooted in colonialism and neocolonialism, the impact of globalization and resource extraction, and political instability. The document discusses the impact of the 1884-1885 Berlin Conference and artificially created borders in Africa and how these have contributed to contemporary instability in the region. The externalization of European borders, particularly through agreements with countries like Morocco and Níger, and the militarization of borders impact migration routes. It also highlights the role of Libya as a migration hub before its destabilization in 2011 and discusses the exploitation and racism faced by migrants. The document ends by mentioning the high death rates in the Sahara desert compared to the Mediterranean and the role of networks in assisting migrants.",

The text explores the implications of these border dynamics on citizenship, territory, and sovereignty, arguing for a transformation of these institutions and proposing a pluriversal approach to knowledge and societal models.

It provides an overview of the legal framework governing maritime boundaries, including the concept of equidistance and the delimitation of the territorial sea, contiguous zone, continental shelf, and exclusive economic zone. The document explains the complexities of establishing maritime boundaries, particularly in the context of islands and archipelagos. It specifically details the situation with Algeria, noting that there is no existing agreement between Spain and Algeria regarding their maritime border. The document mentions that Spain's fishing protection zone adheres to the principle of equidistance, while Algeria's fishing zone does not extend to the limits unilaterally set by Spain. It also mentions a recent incident where Algeria opened a tender for oil exploration in an area that slightly exceeded the equidistance line with Spain, leading to a Spanish reservation of rights. The document suggests that this incident might initiate negotiations for the delimitation of continental shelves between the two countries, emphasizing the need for cooperation and legal clarity in the process. The document also examines the maritime borders between Spain and other countries such as France, Portugal and Morocco.",

Specifically, it discusses the rise of jihadist groups in these areas and the responses to counter-terrorism, particularly focusing on Al Qaeda and Daesh. The document addresses Algeria's internal threat perception and security management, especially related to jihadist groups. It also notes the strained relationship between Algeria and Morocco, which exacerbates regional security challenges. The Sahel region is explored as a Jihadist epicenter in Africa, highlighting the link to the Maghreb, and hence, also to Algeria.",

It frames this displacement within the context of tensions arising from the United States' security strategy in the Andean region and the diverging responses of the Colombian (Uribe) and Venezuelan (Chávez) governments to this strategy. The research hypothesizes that the increased displacement is a result of heightened violence and deteriorating socioeconomic conditions in Colombia, exacerbated by US policies like economic liberalization, anti-narcotics efforts (Plan Colombia), and counter-terrorism measures. The contrasting approaches of Uribe (pro-US) and Chávez (anti-US) intensified existing border tensions and directly impacted the forced migration of Colombians. The study focuses on the Táchira and Norte de Santander border region, highlighting historical issues, trade dynamics, and the impact of Plan Colombia's fumigation efforts on displacement. The report details the methodology employed, involving literature reviews, document analysis, interviews, and fieldwork in the border area. It also touches upon Venezuelan responses to the refugee situation, including the establishment of the National Refugee Commission, challenges with international perceptions, and complex bilateral relations. The paper concludes that US security policies have significantly influenced the Colombian-Venezuelan border region and exacerbated the forced displacement crisis, due to Uribe's close alignment with the United States and Chávez's oppositional stance. This dynamic has complicated bilateral relations, particularly regarding border security and refugee management.",

It details the historical context of French colonialism in Algeria and the efforts of the AUMA to combat cultural aggression and promote Algerian national identity through education and the preservation of Islamic and Arabic culture. The document focuses on the role of figures like Aḥmad Ben Bādīs and al-Bašīr al-Ibrāhīmī in establishing the AUMA and its influence in various regions of Algeria, including Hennaya. It highlights the activities of local figures like al-Ḥaŷŷī Bū‘azza in supporting the AUMA's mission. The text further elaborates on the construction of the Madrasa al-Adāb and the significance of its opening in Hennaya. It includes excerpts from a speech by al-Ibrāhīmī emphasizing the importance of education, faith, and national identity in resisting colonialism. Finally, it mentions the increasing tensions and attacks by colonists on the ulemas in 1956, which led to the radicalization of discourses and the eventual revolution in Algeria.",
