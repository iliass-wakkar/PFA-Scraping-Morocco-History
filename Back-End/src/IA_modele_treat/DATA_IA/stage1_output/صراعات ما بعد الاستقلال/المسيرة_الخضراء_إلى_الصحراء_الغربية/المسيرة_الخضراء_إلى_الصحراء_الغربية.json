It discusses how civil society has attempted to address the illegality of resource plunder, and how corporations exploit renewable resources in the region. The thesis provides an alternative legal reasoning to tackle this form of exploitation, using Siemens' wind farming and eco-tourism in Dakhla Bay as case studies. The document provides context about the continued dispute over Western Sahara following the Green March, and how the effects of the occupation are still felt in the region.",

It further asserts that Moroccan laws and practices apply in Western Sahara, driven by societal impetus rather than governmental decree. The article emphasizes the lasting influence of the Green March on Moroccan society, evidenced by commemorative songs like ‘Sawt El Hassan’ and the issuance of postage stamps.",

It also discusses the lack of progress regarding a self-determination referendum and analyzes the regional and international conflicts preventing the Sahrawi from gaining sovereignty.

The book examines the long-running conflict over Western Sahara's status, focusing on the role of natural resources like fish, oil, and phosphates. It analyzes why the territory, largely desert and sparsely populated, has been a point of contention since Spain's departure in 1976. The book includes a summary of the conflict by Pedro Pinte Leite, an overview of the natural resource situation by Toby Shelley, and the UN's legal opinion from 2002 by Hans Corell.

It highlights the perspective that the Sahrawi people's right to self-determination has been consistently violated, focusing on the exploitation of resources, human rights abuses, and the current political deadlock. The paper also examines the evolution of the Frente Polisario, its internal dynamics, and its relationship with other nationalist movements.

The chapter contends that EJOLT's position overlooks the benefits that development projects bring to the one million inhabitants within the Moroccan Sahara and that its rhetoric risks triggering violence and instability. The analysis is based on content analysis of EJOLT's homepage and aims to demystify what the authors perceive as a biased and defamatory discourse.",

While the paper doesn't explicitly discuss the Green March (المسيرة الخضراء إلى الصحراء الغربية), it describes the broader context of efforts to manage and combat desertification in the Maghreb region. The research analyzes the long-term performance (1925-2013) of native Aleppo pines within the Algerian Green Barrier by examining tree-ring width and carbon isotope discrimination to determine the trees' basal area increment (BAI) and intrinsic water-use efficiency (WUEi). The study also discusses the impacts of climate change and anthropogenic disturbances on the Green Barrier.

The paper argues for a solution conforming to international law that is acceptable to all parties involved, emphasizing its importance for global food security due to Morocco's control over a significant portion of the world's phosphate supply (including that of Western Sahara). The paper recommends Czechia maintain neutrality, support UN efforts, and pursue trade and scientific cooperation with Morocco based on the Green Partnership.",

While the Green March itself is mentioned briefly, the document concentrates on the ongoing issues of Moroccan occupation, the plight of Saharawi refugees, the exploitation of natural resources, and the potential for a return to armed conflict. The source discusses the historical background, the failure of the UN referendum, and the various attempts to find a resolution to the conflict. It highlights the frustration of the Saharawi people and the potential for renewed hostilities, as well as the role of international actors such as Algeria, France, and the UN. The essays within the source analyze the legal and ethical aspects of the conflict, particularly regarding the exploitation of natural resources and the implications for international law and humanitarian law. It examines the role of phosphate mining and its impact on the Saharawi people, as well as the efforts of the SADR to manage its natural resources and assert its sovereignty. Ultimately, the source suggests that the continued occupation of Western Sahara and the exploitation of its resources are major sources of conflict and could lead to further destabilization of the region.",

It analyzes European court judgments related to trade and fisheries agreements between Morocco and the European Union, particularly concerning the application of these agreements to Western Sahara. The core argument revolves around the principle of self-determination, the law governing non-self-governing territories, and permanent sovereignty over natural resources in relation to the occupied Western Sahara. The article notes the general view that Western Sahara is under belligerent occupation but highlights that courts have often based their decisions on self-determination and the rights of non-self-governing territories rather than directly invoking the law of occupation. It explores the convergence of these legal frameworks in cases of long-term occupation and questions the basis for establishing authority in such situations. It includes references to numerous UN resolutions, legal conventions (Hague and Geneva), and legal scholars to build up its argument about the legal status of Western Sahara.",

The analysis provides legal background, including the UN's listing of Western Sahara as a non-self-governing territory, the ICJ's advisory opinion that pre-colonial ties between Morocco and Western Sahara did not imply sovereignty, and Morocco's occupation of Western Sahara following the 'Green March' on November 6th. It asserts that the Saharawi people have a right to self-determination and to freely dispose of their natural resources, and that Morocco's occupation and annexation is a serious breach of international law. The document emphasizes the duties of third states, such as the EU, not to recognize the annexation or assist in the occupation. It discusses the use of natural resources in Western Sahara, stating that Morocco has no legal title to them and may only use them to benefit the people of Western Sahara. It critiques the EU-Morocco FPA, arguing that it does not adequately address the requirements of international law and may strengthen Moroccan control over the territory. The document concludes that the 2013 Protocol fails to conform to international law, which was one of the reasons that the European Parliament rejected the Protocol in 2011, and that the Parliament should reject the current Protocol as well. It is signed by a number of professors and experts in international law.",

It delves into the political dynamics between Morocco, Algeria, and the Polisario Front, and the involvement of international actors such as the United States and the United Nations. The paper also explores the economic factors driving the conflict, particularly the control of phosphate resources and the potential for uranium extraction. It further analyzes the humanitarian situation in Sahrawi refugee camps, including health concerns, education, and the role of women. The paper concludes by proposing potential solutions for resolving the conflict, such as reinstating the Trusteeship Council and promoting diplomatic negotiations to ensure the Sahrawi people's right to self-determination and control over their territory.

The introduction discusses the context of Francisco Franco's impending death, King Hassan II's justification for the Green March, Spain's withdrawal from the territory, and the Madrid Accords. It also references the International Court of Justice's ruling on the Sahrawi cause, the establishment of Sahrawi refugee camps in Algeria, the war between the Polisario Front and Morocco/Mauritania, and the MINURSO-negotiated ceasefire. The introduction highlights the lack of progress on holding a referendum on the sovereignty of the Western Sahara and the European Court of Justice's ruling on trade agreements between the EU and Morocco regarding the territory. It concludes by outlining the focus of the special issue, which brings together experts from various disciplines to examine the ongoing conflict and various aspects of Sahrawi culture and society.

It highlights the historical ties between Morocco and Western Sahara, Spain's relinquishment of control to Morocco and Mauritania in 1975 and explores Algeria's opposition and support for the Polisario Front. The paper also examines the use of petitions in the Fourth Committee, the Madrid Accords of November 14, 1975, and Morocco's autonomy plan, arguing for the UN Security Council to be the primary body addressing the issue. Critiques are leveled at the Fourth Committee's handling of the situation, including its inflexibility, double standards, and continued listing of Western Sahara as a Non-Self-Governing Territory.

It argues that the Committee's involvement is now largely irrelevant because the issue is addressed by the UN Security Council as a matter of peace and security, not decolonization. The paper traces the history of the conflict, starting with Morocco's request to the UN in 1963 to include Western Sahara on the list of territories to be decolonized from Spain. It details Spain's relinquishment of control to Morocco and Mauritania in 1975, the establishment of the Polisario Front, and Algeria's support for the Polisario. It highlights the ICJ advisory opinion in 1975 and the Madrid Accords, and it analyzes how the Fourth Committee has handled petitions and hearings related to Western Sahara. The paper also critically evaluates the Committee’s work, suggesting it is often inflexible, driven by outdated statements and adversarial processes, and that it duplicates efforts more appropriately handled by the Security Council. The paper concludes by stating that because the issue is no longer about decolonization but regional stability, the UN needs to reform its approach, prioritizing pragmatic and sustainable solutions rather than obsolete ideals.",

The paper analyzes the United Nations' involvement, particularly through MINURSO, and the United States' strategic interests and support for Morocco in the region.

The document argues that Morocco's actions, including the Green March and subsequent annexation, deny the Sahrawi people's right to self-determination. It analyzes the EC-Morocco Fisheries Partnership Agreement (FPA) and its implications for recognizing Morocco's claim to sovereignty, suggesting that the FPA, by allowing fishing in Western Saharan waters, implicitly recognizes Morocco's claim.

The paper discusses Morocco's Roadmap to regionalize the country, including the Western Sahara, which at the time was presented in general guidelines. The paper's purpose is to provide a more operational definition to the Roadmap and specific recommendations for its implementation. The paper also seeks to address how this plan will resolve the Western Sahara conflict. The research methods involved categorizing public statements by King Mohammed VI, evaluating the Roadmap against decentralization literature, and providing recommendations based on the author's 18 years of experience in Moroccan development. The paper finds Morocco's Roadmap to be innovative compared to other decentralization models. It suggests that resolving the Western Sahara conflict is urgent for regional stability and that the international community is receptive to Morocco's regionalization proposal, which extends power transfer from the capital to the regions. The paper aims to provide detailed insight into Moroccan regionalization, which had been receiving increased attention but remained abstract.",

Despite this extraterritorial element, the SADR maintains control over approximately one-quarter of Western Sahara, fulfilling some requirements for declarative statehood. The article highlights the nuances surrounding the SADR's internal sovereignty regarding territory, population, and government and draws comparisons with other secessionist parastates. The SADR exists within a frozen conflict, prolonged by ineffective peace settlements, the presence of international peacekeeping forces, and the role of global powers. Algeria's support has been crucial for the resilience of the SADR.

The article outlines the history of Western Sahara, from the 1960s to the early 1990s. It covers the UN's recognition of the Saharawi people's right to self-determination, Spain's failure to decolonize the territory, the expansionist ambitions of Morocco and Mauritania, and the UN Visiting Mission report of June 1975. Critically, it mentions the Green March, organized by King Hassan on November 6, 1975, and the Madrid Accord signed on November 14, 1975, between Spain, Mauritania, and Morocco, which divided Western Sahara between Morocco and Mauritania. The abstract further details the armed struggle by the Polisario Front, King Hassan's attempts to prevent the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) from joining the OAU, the UN-OAU Settlement Proposals of 1988, and the deadlock over voter identification for a proposed referendum. The article suggests the West could pressure King Hassan to allow a UN-supervised referendum but notes the issue isn't a Western priority. The article analyzes the Moroccan expansionist policies and their impact on the Western Sahara issue.",

The study highlights that Western Sahara is a politically sensitive area and its economic development can be achieved through exploitation of its mineral resources. The research describes the application of cost-effective remote sensing techniques, specifically Landsat ETM+ imageries, to detect and map mineral deposits, especially iron. Image processing techniques such as false color composite, band ratioing, and principal component analysis were employed. Field campaigns in Western Sahara confirmed the occurrence of iron deposits. The authors suggest that this technology can be transferred to Saharawi technicians, enabling independent exploration and management of mineral resources. A reference to Pazzanita, A. G. (1994). Morocco versus Polisario: A political interpretation. The Journal of Modern African Studies, 32(2), 265–278 is included within the references.",

The study outlines the Madrid Agreement between Spain, Morocco, and Mauritania, where Spain relinquished its administration of the Sahara.

It examines the mechanisms of socialization, the influence of tribal structures, family, neighborhood, and school on Sahrawi youth. The document also explores the relationship between these young people and the Moroccan state, particularly focusing on the ways in which the state attempts to integrate and control them through education, employment, and political strategies, while also facing contestation and resistance from the Sahrawi youth who express their autonomy through various means, including online activism and protests. The study highlights the challenges of quantifying and understanding the political leanings of this demographic, noting the complex interplay between state influence, tribal identity, and aspirations for self-determination.",

The review mentions the 'Marche Verte' (Green March) of 1975 as a pivotal event that changed the strategic landscape, and analyzes Morocco's subsequent efforts to consolidate its control over the territory through internal unification, diplomatic outreach, military superiority, administrative measures, and economic development. The review also discusses the role of Algeria's political and military interests in supporting the Polisario Front and the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (RASD).

          "source_summary": "This policy brief from the OCP Policy Center discusses the legal and political implications of the seizure of Moroccan phosphate shipments by South Africa, focusing on the underlying issue of Western Sahara's status. It critiques the South African court's decision to uphold the seizure based on the Polisario's claim to represent the Sahrawi people and its challenge to Morocco's exploitation of resources in the region. The brief provides arguments against the court's reasoning, emphasizing Morocco's peaceful recovery of the Sahara, the economic benefits for the Sahrawi population from phosphate exploitation, and the political motivations driving South Africa's stance. The author argues that the Polisario is not the legitimate representative of the Sahrawi population and that Morocco's presence in the Sahara is not an occupation. The article aims to address the core conflict and shed light on how Morocco reclaimed the Sahara with events such as the Green March.",

The article examines the intergenerational identity restructuring process within the Sahrawi refugee camps in Algeria. It analyzes the first generation of the camps as a product of their history and the revolution, and the second generation, born in the camps, as a product of the camps themselves and the paradox between the ideal and the real. The second generation is depicted as grappling with the patriotic and symbolic references of their parents versus the realities of daily life in the camps, forming their identity based on external images and contemplating escape.",

It explains that before the 1970s, these inhabitants didn't identify as \"Sahraouis\" but rather as Arabs or Beduins. The term \"Sahraoui\" was coined by militants resisting Spanish colonization and Moroccan claims to sovereignty.

It also covers the construction of a defense wall by Moroccan authorities in the 1980s to protect the Western Sahara from the Polisario Front. Furthermore, it examines how the definition of \"Sahraoui\" has been contested between independentists and Moroccan partisans, and how the Tekna of Oued Noun, since the 1990s, started identifying as Sahraouis to gain political and economic advantages from the Moroccan state and the UN.",

It examines the evolution of their civic practices, particularly the shift from national political engagement to local development initiatives. The text highlights the complex relationship between the Moroccan state and its diaspora, the challenges faced by Moroccan migrants in engaging with both their host countries and their homeland, and the emergence of transnational citizenship. Crucially, it mentions the Western Sahara annexation in 1975 and its divisive impact on the Moroccan left, specifically referencing the Green March as a pivotal event causing a split within the Association des Marocains de France (AMF).

In contrast, French media, particularly the TV magazine 'Résistances,' sought to uncover and broadcast the 'missing images' of human rights abuses. The article highlights the film 'Le Sahara marocain à travers les âges' (1985) by Kouider Bennani, which commemorated the tenth anniversary of the Green March. This film, while seemingly celebrating a peaceful march, also presented images of King Hassan II as a military leader managing a war against the Polisario Front, subtly revealing the ongoing conflict in the Sahara.

It highlights the discovery of phosphate deposits in Bou Crâa in the late 1960s, which led to increased Spanish interest in the territory. The article examines the 'provincialization' policy implemented by Spain, which aimed to strengthen control, but ultimately reinforced colonial relations and led to a 'second occupation'. It details economic and social transformations, including the sedentarization of the nomadic population and the arrival of settlers from the Iberian Peninsula, which exacerbated social inequalities. The article analyzes political and legislative attempts, including the proposal of autonomy, to give the colonial government more representativeness. However, it concludes that these efforts failed due to international pressures, the rise of Sahrawi, Moroccan, and Mauritanian nationalism, and the ensuing conflict. It mentions that the Spanish government, after the discovery of phosphates and the rise of international pressure, expressed a desire to leave the territory in 1975, leading to the Madrid Accords and the subsequent occupation by Morocco and Mauritania. It also discusses the exodous of Sahrawis and the legacy of this period.",

It discusses the creation of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (RASD) in 1976 and the ongoing struggle for self-determination, including the role of the Polisario Front. The thesis investigates the motivations behind the migration of young Sahrawis from refugee camps and occupied territories to Europe, the challenges they face upon arrival, and the role of Sahrawi associations in supporting their integration. The research examines the complex socio-economic and political factors shaping their trajectories and the need for further sociodemographic data on this population.",

It connects the Green March of 1975 to the suppression of Sahrawi voices and the subsequent disappearances of hundreds of people from Southern Morocco and Western Sahara between 1975 and 1985 by Moroccan security forces. The article details the targeting of educated Sahrawis, including the disappearance of Ahmed Lemaadal Mohamed Medhi El Bou in 1976 after being arrested for suspected support of the Polisario Front. The article also discusses the secret detention center of Tazmamart and the release of some Sahrawi prisoners in 1991 following international pressure, but notes that many \"disappeared\" individuals remain unaccounted for.

The study analyzes how these newspapers, known for adhering to their respective governments' official stances, construct narratives to either support or oppose Morocco's claims. It explores different categories of legitimation, such as authorization, moral evaluation, and rationalization, to understand the arguments and counter-arguments presented in the media. The study finds that both newspapers employed different strategies depending on their national allegiance and adjusted their approaches after the US decision to recognize Moroccan sovereignty. This thesis focuses on the historical context of the conflict and the press strategies of that time period.",

It examines their living conditions, mobility patterns between Western Sahara, Spain, and France, and the impact of precarity on their sense of belonging. The research uses ethnographic geography to understand the dynamics of spatial mobility and the design of mobile living spaces. It also considers the roles of state, NGOs, and local policies concerning seasonal workers. While the main focus is on the Sahrawi diaspora in France, it acknowledges the connection to Western Sahara and the population's reliance on mobility between these regions, indirectly related to the socio-economic context influenced by the unresolved political status of Western Sahara following events like the Green March.",

The article highlights how the UN suggests a specific representation of Western Sahara (separated from Morocco by a solid line), which sparked outrage from a professor at the University of Rabat, arguing that cartography should not deny the Moroccan people's struggle for territorial unity. The article further elaborates on the subjective nature of map creation, the use of color and symbology, and the ways in which maps can be used as tools for propaganda and the exercise of power.",

It discusses the struggle of the Sahrawi people, represented by the Polisario Front, to regain their territory and achieve independence. The document highlights the delays in holding a self-determination referendum due to Moroccan obstructionism, and Morocco's strategic interests in the area's natural resources. It describes the mass exodus of Sahrawi civilians to refugee camps in Algeria, armed conflicts between the Polisario Front and Moroccan and Mauritanian forces, and the construction of defensive walls by the Moroccan army. The document also covers diplomatic efforts by the UN, OAU, and Maghreb countries to find a peaceful resolution, the failure of the initial peace plan, and the ongoing human rights issues in the occupied territories and refugee camps. It analyzes the interests of various international actors, including Spain, the US, and the EU, in the conflict, and examines the internal political dynamics within Morocco, including the role of the monarchy and the military. Furthermore, it touches upon the history of Spanish colonization and decolonization of the territory, the involvement of various political parties in Spain, the economic factors driving the conflict, and the efforts of solidarity organizations to support the Sahrawi people. The document includes a timeline of key events from 1884 to 1997.",

It explores France's historical relationship with Spain and Morocco, its support for Morocco during the Western Sahara dispute, and the coverage of these events by *Le Monde*. The article details how France, under President Valéry Giscard D’Estaing, supported Morocco's claims to the Western Sahara, even orchestrating Mauritania's involvement in the conflict, due to economic interests and a desire for a Francophone West Africa. *Le Monde*'s coverage, it argues, often minimized France's role, reflecting the government's desire to avoid alienating either Spain or Algeria. The study also looks at *Le Monde*'s coverage of the Ifni War in the late 1950s, its evolving relationship with Morocco, and its reporting on the events leading up to Spain's withdrawal from the Sahara.",

It describes the presence of Spanish among the Sahrawi population, both in the refugee camps of Tindouf (Algeria) and within Western Sahara itself. The document details the historical context, including Morocco's occupation after Spain's withdrawal (following the Green March), the establishment of the RASD by the Polisario Front, and the ongoing dispute over the territory's sovereignty. It outlines the educational system's evolution, the decline of Spanish language instruction after the Moroccan occupation, and the current status of Spanish language education in Moroccan schools, the Spanish school 'La Paz' in El Aaiún, and private institutions. The study incorporates data from interviews, surveys, Spanish and Moroccan sources, and UN reports, discussing the challenges in obtaining accurate information. The analysis identifies a continuing connection to the Spanish language among the Sahrawi, fueled by historical ties, cultural identity, and new economic opportunities. However, it notes the precariousness of Spanish language education infrastructure in the region, particularly concerning adequately trained teachers and access to learning materials. The document concludes by emphasizing the need for Spain to reinforce its cultural and educational cooperation in the Western Sahara, despite the ongoing territorial dispute, and highlights the existing signs of Spanish cultural influence in the area.",

La historia de una doble traición\" by Carlos Bajo Erro, published in January 2016, analyzes the history of the Western Sahara from the perspective of Spanish colonialism and its aftermath. It argues that the Sahrawi population has been a victim of a double betrayal by the Spanish State. The first betrayal occurred in 1975 when Spain, under pressure from Morocco and amid Franco's declining health, abandoned the Western Sahara, failing to conduct a promised referendum on self-determination. Instead, Spain secretly negotiated with Morocco and Mauritania to hand over control of the territory. The second betrayal consists of Spain's subsequent silence and denial of its responsibilities in the decolonization process, particularly regarding the Sahrawi refugees in Spain who face statelessness despite holding Spanish documentation. The article details the historical context, starting with the Berlin Conference of 1884-1885, the evolution of Spanish colonial administration, the rise of Sahrawi nationalism and the Frente Polisario, the 1975 Green March, the Madrid Accords, and the subsequent military conflict. It also discusses the legal and administrative complexities of the Western Sahara's status, the UN's involvement, and the implications for Sahrawi individuals regarding their nationality and rights.",

It covers the period from 1975 to January 2011, focusing on the failure of UN-sponsored negotiations between Morocco and the Polisario Front due to their conflicting positions on autonomy versus a referendum for self-determination. The document details various peace plans, including the Baker Plan I and II, and the involvement of key actors like the UN, Morocco, Algeria, Mauritania, and the Polisario Front. It also discusses the exclusion of the term \"referendum\" in UN Security Council resolutions, the Moroccan autonomy proposal of 2007, and the ongoing efforts to find a mutually acceptable political solution. The document highlights the creation of the Royal Advisory Council for the Sahara (CORCAS) by Morocco and the establishment of a commission to propose a general concept of regionalization. It touches on the human rights situation and the need for Morocco to adopt a strategy of tolerance and seduction rather than repression towards the Sahrawi population.",

The document details the court's findings that Western Sahara is a non-self-governing territory, not part of Morocco, and Morocco is not the administering power. The analysis also covers the admissibility of the Polisario Front's legal challenge and the EU's obligations to ensure the exploitation of resources in Western Sahara benefits its inhabitants. Most pertinently, it covers the historical context, including the lead-up to the Green March and its aftermath, including UN resolutions and agreements. The document extensively discusses the legal implications of Morocco's presence in the territory, referring to it as an occupation, and the application of international law, including humanitarian law, in this context. It specifically examines how the EU's agreements with Morocco affect the Western Sahara and its people, particularly regarding resource exploitation and the right to self-determination, emphasizing the necessity of respecting international law and the will of the Sahrawi population. The document argues that the EU's actions should align with international law, including the right to self-determination and the protection of the Sahrawi people's interests.

It notes that despite nearly 30 years without major progress since the ceasefire between Morocco and the Polisario Front, the Polisario Front considered the agreement broken in 2020 and declared a state of war to achieve the liberation of the Sahrawi people, which has drastically increased tension in the area due to the issues of autonomy and self-determination.

It argues that the EU's weak defense of human rights in Western Sahara challenges its institutions and citizens, questioning the EU's role as a normative actor and its commitment to its foundational values as a \"community of law\". The article highlights contradictions in the EU's stance, particularly its economic benefits derived from the region, which perpetuate human rights violations and colonization. It also mentions the \"Green March\" of 1975 and other events like the Gdeim Izik camp dismantling (2010), the Guerguerat events (2020), and migration issues in Ceuta and Melilla (2021). It criticizes the EU's tacit support of Morocco's expansionist policies and analyzes the legal complexities surrounding Western Sahara's decolonization process, particularly regarding the right to self-determination and the exploitation of natural resources. The study also explores the potential implications of the EU's actions on regional stability, security, and the fight against terrorism.

The thesis examines the development of Sahrawi identity within the context of Spanish colonization of Western Sahara from its origins to the Madrid Accords. It discusses the historical background, Sahrawi society, Spanish colonial policy, and the reasons for the emergence of the Polisario Front. The thesis specifically mentions the Green March on November 6, 1975, and its impact on the conflict and Spanish foreign policy. It also details the Spanish government's decision to negotiate with Morocco and Mauritania, leading to the Madrid Accords, where Spain relinquished its decolonization responsibilities, opening the way for the occupation of the territory by Morocco and Mauritania.

The article traces the history of Spanish colonization, the involvement of the UN, and the Madrid Accords of November 14, 1975, through which Spain attempted to transfer administrative control to Morocco and Mauritania before Franco's death, ultimately leading to the invasion by these countries. It also references the war between the Frente POLISARIO and Morocco/Mauritania, the current divided state of the Sahrawi people, and the stalled UN settlement plan. The article further elaborates on the legal implications of Western Sahara's status, including the illegality of Morocco exploiting its resources and the distinct legal identity of the Sahrawi people.

It argues for a nuanced, politically-aware approach to ethical considerations, especially when researching resistance to authoritarian regimes. The paper draws on the author's personal experiences with fieldwork among Saharawi activists resisting Moroccan occupation. It touches upon key issues such as participant risk, state permissions, personal risk, and anonymity. The author argues that a feminist and activist approach validates, and indeed necessitates, undermining some ethical codes, such as openly declaring research aims to occupying authorities, that are usually left unquestioned. The paper also details the historical context of the Western Sahara conflict, including the Spanish colonial period, the invasion by Morocco and Mauritania in 1975, the establishment of refugee camps in Algeria, and the ongoing nonviolent resistance movement led by Saharawi civilians. It discusses the concept of 'loss of fear' among Saharawi activists following events like the Gdeim Izik protest camp in 2010, and how this impacts ethical considerations. The paper also explores the importance of international witnesses to expose the brutality of the Moroccan occupation and the different approaches to activist research, advocating for an activist/researcher role that combines academic work with direct action and solidarity efforts. The author details her engagement with Western Sahara Campaign UK and Western Sahara Resource Watch.",
