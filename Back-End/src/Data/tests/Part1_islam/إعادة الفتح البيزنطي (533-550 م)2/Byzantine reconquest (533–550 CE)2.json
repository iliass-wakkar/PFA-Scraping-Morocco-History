        "paragraph": "The Late Antique Little Ice Age (LALIA), and the Justinianic Plague, were recently suggested as the possible culprits for settlement contraction and population decline that supposedly occurred in the 6th c. CE. According to some who support this claim, these changes contributed to the weakening of this empire, which eventually led to the loss of vast territories and its defeat by the Persians and Arabs in the first half of the 7th c. CE. The assumptions that climate and plague had devastating impacts in the 6th c. CE are largely based on selected textual evidence, and archaeological evidence outside of the boundaries of the Eastern Roman Empire. As the current article will show, it seems that these assumptions are inherently incorrect as vast amounts of evidence, including archaeological survey data, settlement patterns, shipwreck analyses, pottery distribution in the Mediterranean and other material, indicate that there was no decline in the 6th c. CE. On the contrary, it is possible that there was a peak in population size in the second half of the 6th c. CE, suggesting that the LALIA and the Justinianic plague were limited in their impact.Why do empires fall? This is one of the questions that fascinate many, both in academia and among the general public. In the search for an answer, emotions are high, and imagination can run wild. Human intervention, mostly in the form of war, is commonly attributed to the decline of empires. Up until 40 years ago, historical research was oriented to this line of thinking. However, in recent decades, new suggestions have emerged that attributed the rise and fall of empires to climate and disease.[1] Many of the suggestions focused on the decline of the Roman Empire, with Kyle Harper’s work being the most infamous of them all.[2] Some believe that the Roman-Persian war of 602–628 CE, including the 14 years of conquest of Judaea/Palaestina (modern-day Israel and the West Bank) and Egypt, and the Islamic conquest after the Battle of Yarmuk of 636 CE, should not be viewed as the sole causes for the decline of the Eastern Roman Empire.[3] The same researchers tried to claim that the Empire was already weakened in the 6th c. CE due to climatic and epidemiological disasters that contributed to the occurrence and consequences of the said wars. These calamities were the Late Antique Little Ice Age (LALIA)[4] and the Justinianic plague,[5] whose initial occurrence transpired in 541 to 544 CE,[6] and which allegedly had multiple occurrences in the 200 years that followed and supposedly caused a decline in the size of the population.Researchers, such as Harper and Sarris, point to climate and disease while mainly basing their hypotheses on selected textual evidence.[7] There are other publications in support of this theory, such as those that were published by the NEGEVBYZ project.[8] The publications of this project supposedly reveal a decline in the 6th c. CE using micro-scale archaeological data from the north-western Negev desert. Dating a decline to this period is usually linked to the Justinianic plague and/or LALIA as the main instigator, or as an indirect cause.[9] It is important to emphasise that former research claiming that there was high mortality, and significant environmental and social impacts, due to the Justinianic plague and the LALIA, neglected to use the majority of the available archaeological data."

        "subtitle": "Introduction to the Debate Surrounding the Decline of the Eastern Mediterranean",
        "paragraph": "As was previously mentioned, two elements were suggested as the perpetrators for the supposed decline in the population and the number of settlements during the 6th c. CE in the Eastern Roman Empire. The first of the two is an environmental phenomenon usually defined as the LALIA. Scholars describe the LALIA as a period of cooling in the northern hemisphere which caused a decrease in the annual average temperature.[12] This cooling period is linked to a series of volcanic eruptions over a period of ten years starting in 536 CE.[13] Some argue that the volcanic eruptions lowered the average summer temperatures across the northern hemisphere by 1.6 °C, yet this decrease varied significantly from region to region. While the higher latitudes of the northern hemisphere experienced a decrease of more than 2 °C,[14] the lower latitudes, encompassing all the territories of the Roman Empire, experienced a decrease in temperatures as little as 0.25 °C to 1 °C. In the southernmost areas of the Roman Empire, including Egypt and Judaea/Palaestina, average temperatures decreased only around 0.25 °C.[15]On the other hand, Antti Arjava showed in his seminal work that there is no textual evidence to indicate that the dust cloud of 536 CE, which supposedly covered the sun and kickstarted the LALIA, had any effect outside of Europe. On the contrary, the ancient sources explicitly mention that this dust cloud’s effect was limited almost exclusively to Europe.[16] According to Arjava, it is probable that the effects of the volcanic eruptions of 536 CE were limited to the north of latitude 35.[17] This would mean that most of the territories of the Eastern Roman Empire, including Judaea/Palaestina and Egypt, were not affected. Instead, Arjava highlighted that the only territory in the Eastern Roman Empire where there is textual evidence for the effects of this dust cloud is Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey).[18] Moreover, all the literary, papyrological and epigraphic sources do not state that there were any long-lasting effects. Similarly, the few ancient authors that explicitly discuss the phenomenon, mentioned that its effects did not last more than one or two years, with no source describing long-lasting effects on the agricultural yields.[19]Despite this small variation in temperature in many regions, and the lack of written sources, some scholars claim that the cooling severely impacted the Mediterranean weather system, and subsequently caused the eastern part of the Roman Empire to collapse.[20] Moreover, there are some who claim that the impact of this climate change was significant and lasted over a hundred years, from 536 to 660 CE.[21] However, palaeoclimatologists continue to debate the extent and impact of the LALIA, and some suggest that it only lasted from 536 to 560 CE.[22] Contrary to those who claim that the LALIA had negative effects on the environment and empire, other researchers argue that such a small drop in temperature in the Negev desert does not necessarily produce negative effects, but on the contrary may have a slight positive effect, rendering such areas as marginally more fertile and expanding the extent of arable land.[23] Another study revealed that there is no visible link between climate change and social stability, including the frequency of societal changes in different areas of the world.[24] Paula Kouki has similarly demonstrated that in some regions, there is no connection between the climate proxies of a given region, and the region’s changes in settlement size and number. According to her, this situation casts doubt on the reliability of the available climate proxies, as well as on the designation of some periods as having an optimum climate.[25]"

        "paragraph": "Before the general trends of decline in the Roman Empire can be examined, the nature and dating of this deterioration must be examined at a smaller scale, in individual sites and micro-regions. One of the best regions where this can be done effectively is in the region of Judaea/Palaestina. This area has been extensively and consistently excavated in the last century, with numerous sites and finds being constantly analysed and published. Due to this large number of sites with vast amounts of information, only the region of the north-western Negev, and the cities of Scythopolis and Jerusalem will be examined in detail, combined with a later examination of the Archaeological Survey of Israel."

        "subtitle": "North-Western Negev Settlements",
        "paragraph": "A decrease in population in other parts of the Empire would create a decrease in the population of the arid regions, as people would move to recently vacated lands, which were safer and more fertile. Thus, such arid regions are considered good indicators of societal change, and so great emphasis was placed on their excavations and subsequent analysis.[36] One such area where a supposed decline would be visible is the settlements of the north-western Negev desert (Fig. 1).Map of the north-western Negev and its vicinity with the city of Elusa and the settlements of Nessana and Shivta indicated. The map was created by using ArcGIS Pro 2.9.3.The site at the crux of the theory regarding the decline of this region is Elusa. Originally a Nabatean waystation that was established in the 3rd c. BCE,[37] it evolved into the main polis of the Roman Negev a few centuries later. The city prospered during the 4th to the 6th c. CE from its extensive agriculture and viticulture industry.[38] The polis was surrounded by a number of large garbage mounds, and the surveying team conjectured that an abandonment of trash mounds could be an indicator of the breakdown of municipal facilities, societal collapse, and an emigration of people.[39] Thus, a survey and an examination of the garbage mounds surrounding the city of Elusa was conducted, and their end use was dated through the use of radiocarbon dating and ceramic typology. According to them, the polis and the surrounding settlements started to deteriorate in the mid-6th c. CE, and so this decline was attributed to the Justinianic plague and the LALIA.[40] However, the methods of dating used by the NEGEVBYZ project were problematic."

        "subtitle": "Cities in Judaea/Palaestina",
        "paragraph": "Further examples of demographic and economic decline dated to the 7th c. CE can be seen in archaeological sites from the centre of Judaea/Palaestina. An example for this can be found in Scythopolis, where the public buildings were so neglected during the 7th c. CE that they were dismantled by the public for use as building materials.[78] This is also visible in other archaeological sites, such as the cities of Yavne-Yam, Yavne, and Emmaus, and various other agricultural settlements in their vicinity.[79] The causes of this societal and economic collapse can be explained by the deterioration of the trade routes and economy as a result of the region’s political control changing multiple times in a relatively short time period. In addition, the new rulers of the region were in an almost constant state of war with the late Eastern Roman Empire, and the local population possibly fled to what was left under the rule of the Emperor in Constantinople. Therefore, due to extensive migration and the instability of the economy and trade, the settlements and cities of the eastern Mediterranean deteriorated.[80]On the other hand, the city of Jerusalem remained relatively stable in the 7th c. CE as the Persian and Islamic conquests of the city did not destroy the infrastructure of the city.[81] This may have been due to the importance of the city as a seat of power in the area and an important administrative centre.[82] However, there are discoveries of mass graves in Jerusalem dated to the Persian conquest, which are also mentioned in ancient texts. These texts show that the Christians were marched out of the city to be killed, and so there are few visible signs of destruction in the city itself.[83]"

        "subtitle": "Shipwreck Analysis",
        "paragraph": "The first type of information that can provide a broader picture is an analysis of shipwreck data, based on two well-known databases: the shipwreck database of Harvard University,[84] and the Oxford Roman Economy Project (OXREP) database,[85] which is partially based on the Harvard database.[86] These databases aggregated data on shipwrecks from antiquity, including their dates, site/shipwreck name, GPS location, and cargo. However, the biggest impediment to easily interpreting this data is a lack of information on the body of water from which the ship came. Consequently, this information was completed, with the combined dataset including the body of water in which each shipwreck was found. This enabled the easy exclusion of ships that were not discovered in the Mediterranean Sea.But why do shipwrecks matter? The use of this type of data implements a method that has recently been applied in different studies, such as Justin Leidwanger’s latest book.[87] This method assumes that the number of shipwrecks has statistical significance, and greater amounts of maritime traffic are reflected in higher numbers of shipwrecks in certain periods. As the number of ships in use increases, so does the probability that some of them will sink due to storms and other calamities. Generally, the comparison of the number of shipwrecks between half-centuries and centuries is considered acceptable and common, and is an important tool in understanding the volume of sea-borne trade. The assumption at the foundation of this system is that unique catastrophic events leading to numerous ships sinking simultaneously are short-lived and rare, and a comparison between long periods neutralises the distinctive effect of such calamities.[88]The main obstacle in employing shipwrecks is the difficulty in exactly establishing the date of the ship’s sinking. As a result, in most cases, only broad estimates are available, ranging from a few decades to many centuries, depending on the type and extent of investigation undertaken on the shipwreck by surveyors and/or excavators, as well as the artefacts uncovered. To compensate for this difficulty, the full date range of each shipwreck was inputted into the graph. Thus, a ship can appear in multiple columns. This method is not entirely accurate, but it provides a valuable and universal picture, although with some deviation.[89] The outcome of this method is that the sum of all the columns would vastly outnumber the number of ships appearing in the database. Leidwanger presented similar raw figures in his book. However, the number of ships he examined was less than what will be presented here.[90] Henceforth, the data in this article will be the most comprehensive and up-to-date data available, despite the fact that it is only a partial study of a continually evolving dataset.[91]"

        "subtitle": "Archaeological Survey of Israel",
        "paragraph": "The Archaeological Survey of Israel is the most thorough archaeological survey conducted in a country. The entire country was carefully divided into survey grids of 100 km2 (10x10 km) in the early 1960s, with each grid being published as a survey map,[100] of which 70 % have been surveyed and published since the 1960s.[101] Each map was published after a team of archaeologists systematically surveyed the area on foot, and methodically inspected every square metre of the grid where possible. Individual teams plotted, marked, and noted any site with signs of anthropogenic activity, as well as dated the site where possible using indicative sherds or other artefacts. Upon the completion of a survey, the team would include a summary and analysis of the various periods identified in the survey grid, as well as their conclusions concerning changes in settlement patterns, the date of these changes, and their possible causes.Other important surveys conducted in Israel outside of the general Israel survey is a recent salvage survey in Beth Shemesh,[102] as well as emergency surveys in Judaea and Samaria in the West-Bank between the years 1967 and 1968.[103] Moreover, there are the Manasseh Hill Country Surveys that were conducted by Adam Zertal and encompass most of the territories of Samaria.[104] All these surveys were conducted in a similar manner to the Israel survey, and each map and survey were published individually, electronically and/or in hard copy. Some of them were more organised and straightforward, while others were less so. The information from all the mentioned surveys was collected, and a quantitative analysis of the number of settlements from the Hellenistic to the Early Islamic period was conducted.[105]Graph indicating the number of sites per period in modern-day Israel."

        "subtitle": "Archaeological Surveys and Excavations in Turkey, Cyprus, and Greece",
        "paragraph": "Evidence for this trend can also be seen in surveys and excavations in some regions of Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey).[117] During the Late Roman period (325–636 CE), for example, the Maeander Valley saw a rise in agricultural acreage, population, and settlement size.[118] Similar trends were also seen in Phrygia,[119] Miletus,[120] Sagalassos,[121] and the Troad.[122] Moreover, several recent works have emphasised and demonstrated that an increase in population occurred in many regions of the Anatolian countryside in the 4th c. CE, and that this pattern persisted until the mid-7th c. CE in several phases.[123]The first phase, from the 4th to the early 6th c. CE, was devoid of any climatic change, be it an increase or decrease in temperature or precipitation. Yet, during the second phase of this trend, from the mid-6th to the 7th c. CE, there was an increase in population density that was only matched in modern times and is comparable to the demographic fluorescence in Judaea/Palaestina and other Mediterranean basin regions. This second phase of growth overlapped with a colder period and higher precipitation, which coincides with the LALIA. While the LALIA is commonly thought to be between 550 and 660 CE at most, this colder and wetter period lasted until the mid-8th century CE. Such a climate was reputedly ideal, which may have contributed to the expansion in population and agricultural industry witnessed in other sections of the Mediterranean. Even though there was no change in climate in the mid-7th c. CE, the number of sites and the regional pollen record decreased.[124] This decline, like in other regions, was driven by anthropogenic elements. War ravaged the land, decimating trade, which was especially destructive in Anatolia, as it became the principal border zone between the Byzantine Empire, which arose from the ashes of the Eastern Roman Empire, and the Islamic Caliphates.[125]Another notable example is the archaeological excavations and surveys carried out in Cyprus. From them, it is clear that a peak in the number of settlements, and in many cases in their size, occurred between the 5th and 7th c. CE. The scholars emphasised in numerous places that the peak must be dated to the end of the 6th c. or the beginning of the 7th c. CE, and that the decline began only in the mid-7th c. CE in most regions, and lasted for a very long time after.[126]"

      {
        "subtitle": "Archaeological Surveys in North Africa",
        "paragraph": "North Africa is divided into two distinct regions. Egypt lies on one side, with modern-day Tunisia, Libya, Algeria, and Morocco on the other. Egypt is typically differentiated because it is greatly influenced by the Nile, whose sources depend on the monsoons of the Indian Ocean.[140] During the late 2nd to the 5th c. CE in southern Egypt (Upper Egypt), there is a well-documented fall in the number of sites and population.[141] Conversely, the northern part of Egypt (Lower Egypt), comprising the Nile Delta and Alexandria, had a boom in population and settlements from the 4th to the 7th c. CE.[142] This corresponds and is verified by what can be seen in other countries of the Mediterranean basin, and supports the notion that a population fall did not occur in the 6th c. CE due to the Justinianic plague, but rather in the 7th c. CE due to warfare, and the deterioration of trade.The rest of North Africa is another important region for understanding the changes occurring in the mid-6th to the early 8th c. CE due to its unique history.[143] Compared to the climate of Egypt, the other regions of Northern Africa are part of the Mediterranean climate zone. This region saw frequent changes in control from the early 5th until the 8th c. CE, with the Vandal invasion ending the Late Roman period in 429 CE.[144] Their Kingdom lasted over a century before being deposed by the Eastern Roman Expeditionary force led by Belisarius, who was dispatched by Emperor Justinian I. Following a year of warfare, the conflict concluded with the Vandals’ ultimate surrender in 534 CE.[145] These changes in governance corresponded to the settlement of people in the newly conquered regions, who carried their own distinct material culture with them, synthesising with the local one. As a result, these changes are readily visible in the archaeological record, and so distinct and relatively short periods of time may be recognized using the ceramic assemblage.The lands of North Africa were ruled by the Late Eastern Roman Empire from 534 CE until the Islamic conquest in the late 7th c. CE, a period known in archaeology as the Byzantine period.[146] As a result, the Islamic period is usually defined only from 689 CE.[147] Therefore, due to the Byzantine archaeological period coinciding with the beginning of the LALIA and the Justinianic plague, an examination of this region’s archaeology will reveal whether these calamities had a significant impact on the Eastern Roman Empire."

        "subtitle": "Conclusion",
        "paragraph": "As demonstrated in this article, the utilisation of micro- and macro-scale data allows us to gain a better understanding of the general status of the Late Eastern Roman Empire in the 5th and 6th centuries. The combination of these two types of data has been employed not only to supplement, but also to better understand the demographic and economic transformations that occurred in the Eastern Mediterranean between the 5th and 7th c. CE. As such, there is no evidence that any community in the north-western Negev desert declined in the 6th c. CE. These previous assertions for such a fall were inaccurate and based on incorrect dating, meaning that the decline should be dated to the 7th c. CE.The fact that the decrease occurred in the 7th c. CE entirely excludes at least one of the suggested causes of the decline, the LALIA, as this short-term climate shift with its repeatedly questioned effects happened mainly in the mid-6th c. CE. Additionally, research undertaken in Judaea/Palaestina clearly reveals that there was no significant temperature shift during the mid-6th c. CE. The seventy or more years between the LALIA and the settlement drop show that this short-term change in climate played no role in the decline.The other alleged ‘culprit,’ the Justinianic plague, is similarly unrelated to this fall. From the mid-6th to the beginning of the 8th c. CE, the Justinianic epidemic is said to have lasted 200 years. The fundamental issue with this pandemic is that most experts agree on its size and chronology with considerable accuracy in the mid-6th c. CE. However, there is considerable controversy about its impact, morbidity, and duration, with a substantial lack of mass graves ascribed to the time, fuelling this debate. Furthermore, the consequences and breadth of the disease in the regions of the Eastern Roman Empire are still being debated. Nevertheless, given that the decline was a long process that only started in the 7th c. CE, it can be concluded that it was most likely caused by anthropogenic actions in the form of geopolitical, social, and economic changes brought about by wars between the Late Eastern Roman Empire on the one hand, and the Persians, and later the Arabs, on the other. This is especially true since after the first occurrences of the pandemic in the mid-6th c. CE, the Eastern part of the Mediterranean basin experienced a peak in population and number of sites, suggesting that the Justinianic plague was not severe and possibly inconsequential in the long term. Furthermore, some of the finds from certain areas in Turkey and North Africa imply that there was higher precipitation in certain areas, which may have assisted in settlement and population expansion, and contributed to the peak in population at the end of the 6th century CE. Therefore, it is possible that the climate change in those sub-regions may have counter-balanced the higher mortality rates during the Justinianic plague."

CE due to climatic and epidemi- ological disasters that contributed to the occurrence and consequences of the said wars. These calamities were the Late Antique Little Ice Age (LALIA)4 and the Jus- tinianic plague,5 whose initial occurrence transpired in 541 to 544 CE,6 and which allegedly had multiple occurrences in the 200 years that followed and supposedly caused a decline in the size of the population. Researchers, such as Harper and Sarris, point to climate and disease while mainly basing their hypotheses on selected textual evidence.7 There are other publications in support of this theory, such as those that were published by the NEGEVBYZ project.8 The publications of this project supposedly reveal a decline in 1 Frankopan 2023. 2 His most well-known research: Harper 2017; especially see pages 244–245, 292–293. 3 Regarding the debate on the use of Byzantine instead of Late Roman or Eastern Roman Empire, see: Elton 2018; Heather 2018. In the research conducted on the Eastern and Western Roman Empires, there is a stark difference in the terminology used, especially in archaeological publica- tions. Levantine scholarship (especially in the fields of archaeology and papyrology) tends to use the term Byzantine to define the period between 284 CE (used in Egypt) or 325 CE (used in Israel, Lebanon and Syria) until 636 CE. Similarly, Late Roman is defined as the 2nd and the 3rd centuries CE. On the other hand, in western scholarship the period from 325 to 636 CE is called the Late Roman period. We agree with Elton (2018) and Heather (2018) regarding the lack of any significant change in the beginning of the 4th century CE in the east, which would deem the change in terminology from Roman to Byzantine as acceptable and logical. Only from 636 CE is there enough significant change in the Eastern Roman Empire to warrant a new entity, the Byzantine Empire. Therefore, the following definitions have been implemented in the current paper. The term Late Western Roman Empire is used to describe the west from 325 CE to the fall of the west in 476 CE. The term Late Eastern Roman Empire is used to describe the east from 325 CE until 636 CE. The terms Late Roman and Byzantine are only used in connection with archaeological finds and dating that use these terms. In these cases, we usually mark the relevant dates in brackets at the beginning of the relevant discussion. 4 Büntgen 2016; see also the following notes. 5 Sarris 2002; Little 2007; Meier 2016; Bar-Oz 2019, 8239–8246; Meier 2020; Sarris 2020; for further publications, see the following notes. 6 For a discussion on the use of occurrences rather than waves for the Justinianic plague, see: Eisenberg – Mordechai 2020. 7 Harper 2016, 2017; Sarris 2022. 8 Cosijns – Olshanetsky 2022, 6.\n\nChallenging the Significance of the LALIA and the Justinianic Plague 723 the 6th c. CE using micro-scale archaeological data from the north-western Negev desert. Dating a decline to this period is usually linked to the Justinianic plague and/or LALIA as the main instigator, or as an indirect cause.9 It is important to emphasise that former research claiming that there was high mortality, and sig- nificant environmental and social impacts, due to the Justinianic plague and the LALIA, neglected to use the majority of the available archaeological data. Consequently, the current article wishes to answer these researchers by showing that there was no decline in the 6th c. CE, and that no late 6th c. CE crisis and decline occurred. In addition, it will be suggested that the Eastern Roman Empire was at the peak of its power and population at the end of the 6th c. CE. This claim will be sup- ported by evidence from micro and macro-scale data from throughout the Mediter- ranean, showing that no general decline in population occurred in the mid-6th c. CE. The north-western Negev desert and the cities of Jerusalem and Scythopolis in Judaea/Palaestina,10 will be used as examples of data in the micro-scale. This will be followed by an analysis of data on the macro-scale, such as information from whole regions and countries consisting of thousands to tens of thousands of sites spread over large geographical areas. Information from archaeological surveys conducted in Israel, Cyprus, Turkey and North Africa will be discussed, alongside an exami- nation of shipwreck data indicating the peaks and declines of naval commerce in the Mediterranean.11 By visualising the data on a micro and a macro-scale, it can be seen that the LALIA and the Justinianic plague did not have long-lasting conse- quences in the Eastern Mediterranean. Moreover, the data collated on the micro and macro-scale definitively depict the settlement decline as occurring from the 7th c. CE and onwards. The micro and macro-scale data will be used to complement each other and show how these changes, or lack of changes, were not limited to any specific area. Introduction to the Debate Surrounding the Decline of the Eastern Mediterranean As was previously mentioned, two elements were suggested as the perpetrators for the supposed decline in the population and the number of settlements during the 6th c.

Scholars describe the LALIA as a period of cooling in the northern hemisphere which caused a decrease in the annual average temperature.12 This cooling period is linked to a series of volcanic eruptions over a period of ten years starting in 536 CE.13 Some argue that the volcanic eruptions lowered the average summer temperatures across the northern hemisphere by 1.6 °C, yet this decrease varied significantly from region to region. While the higher latitudes of the northern hemisphere experienced a decrease of more than 2 °C,14 the lower latitudes, encompassing all the territories of the Roman Empire, expe- rienced a decrease in temperatures as little as 0.25 °C to 1 °C. In the southernmost areas of the Roman Empire, including Egypt and Judaea/Palaestina, average tem- peratures decreased only around 0.25 °C.15 On the other hand, Antti Arjava showed in his seminal work that there is no textual evidence to indicate that the dust cloud of 536 CE, which supposedly covered the sun and kickstarted the LALIA, had any effect outside of Europe. On the con- trary, the ancient sources explicitly mention that this dust cloud’s effect was limited almost exclusively to Europe.16 According to Arjava, it is probable that the effects of the volcanic eruptions of 536 CE were limited to the north of latitude 35.17 This would mean that most of the territories of the Eastern Roman Empire, including Judaea/Palaestina and Egypt, were not affected. Instead, Arjava highlighted that the only territory ",

Instead, Arjava highlighted that the only territory in the Eastern Roman Empire where there is textual evidence for the effects of this dust cloud is Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey).18 Moreover, all the literary, papyrological and epigraphic sources do not state that there were any long-lasting effects. Similarly, the few ancient authors that explicitly discuss the phenomenon, mentioned that its effects did not last more than one or two years, with no source describing long-lasting effects on the agricultural yields.19 Despite this small variation in temperature in many regions, and the lack of written sources, some scholars claim that the cooling severely impacted the Medi- terranean weather system, and subsequently caused the eastern part of the Roman Empire to collapse.20 Moreover, there are some who claim that the impact of this climate change was significant and lasted over a hundred years, from 536 to 12 For a review of the literature on the subject until 2017, see: Helama 2017. 13 Sigl 2015, 547; Büntgen 2016, 231, 233; Toohey 2016; Peregrine 2020, 1, 5. 14 Sigl 2015, 547–548. 15 Peregrine 2020, 2–3. 16 Arjava 2005, 80–81. 17 Arjava 2005, 82–83. 18 Arjava 2005, 83, 93. 19 Arjava 2005, 83–94. 20 McCormick 2012.",

According to her, this situation casts doubt on the reliability of the available climate proxies, as well as on the designation of some periods as having an optimum climate.25 With regards to the Eastern Roman Empire, the LALIA is usually not the only accused party that supposedly caused the decline, the other being the Justinianic plague. This plague first hit the Roman Empire, and especially the city of Con- stantinople, in the years 541 to 544 CE.26 It allegedly spread to the far corners of the Empire, in supposed occurrences that swept the area over the following two hundred years.27 However, numerous recent publications suggest that the impact of the Justinianic plague was not as cataclysmic as some scholars have suggested.28 According to these scholars, there is no hard evidence that this plague decimated the Empire, or that the numerous occurrences attributed to the Justinianic plague in the following 200 years were cataclysmic, or even that all can be attributed to the same plague.29 It is important to note that there is some debate regarding the origins of the Jus- tinianic plague, and when exactly to date its first occurrence.

However, the archaeological dating of this burial was pre-550 CE.30 As this is the earliest Y. pestis (bubonic plague, attributed to the Justinianic plague) strain of the period, Sarris stated that this burial can and should be dated from the late 5th to the early 6th c. CE.31 This in turn suggests that the Justin- ianic plague did not start during Justinian’s reign but earlier, and that it may have reached the territories of the empire from a completely different direction, despite previous assumptions and what is stated in contemporary sources.32 Furthermore, the closest ancestor to the Y. pestis strain accredited to the Justin- ianic plague originates from the Tian Shan mountains in Central Asia, and is dated to the 2nd c. CE. This has brought some to suggest Central Asia as a possible loca- tion for the divergence event that birthed the Justinianic plague variety. Therefore, this, alongside a possible earlier dating for the occurrence of the plague in Europe, brings weight to the theory that the migration of the Huns to Europe brought the ancestors of the Justinianic plague to Europe.33 Thus, the plague victim from Edix Hill advances the supposed onset of the plague which supposedly ravaged the Med- iterranean, while also raising questions on its infection rate as people may have lived alongside it for many centuries. Furthermore, no one has claimed there was a decline in the population in the 5th c. CE, or the very beginning of the 6th c. CE, due to disease, especially in the eastern Mediterranean basin. This lack of an epidemi- ological outbreak in the textual records for this period is glaring, especially if the disease was already prevalent in the region. Consequently, a team of archaeologists headed by Guy Bar-Oz surveyed and excavated the settlements of the north-western Negev desert in Judaea/Palaestina as part of the NEGEVBYZ project to try and determine the causes for the decline of the north-western Negev settlements: the Justinianic plague, the LALIA, or the Persian invasion and the Islamic conquest. The project placed great emphasis on the correlation between date and cause: if a decline occurred in the mid-6th c. CE, it is indicative of the Justinianic plague and the LALIA, but if dated to the 7th c. CE, it should be connected to the wars.34 Thus, the NEGEVBYZ project ventured to survey, 30 Keller 2019, SI Table S13. 31 Sarris 2022, 342–343. 32 Benovitz 2014, 488; Keller 2019, SI 18–23; Mordechai 2019, 25547. 33 De Barros Damgaard 2018, 372–373; Keller 2019, 12368. 34 A search focusing on specific years, such as several years in the mid-6th c. CE, in order to find a connection between a decline and the Justinianic plague and the LALIA, or a few specific years in the 7th c. CE, in order to connect the decline to the Islamic conquest, can create a bias. This type of bias was defined by Sessa as sucking-in, meaning that specific dates and the search for them can draws in finds, events and processes that took many years and occurred before the search date",

The Micro-Scale Data Before the general trends of decline in the Roman Empire can be examined, the nature and dating of this deterioration must be examined at a smaller scale, in individual sites and micro-regions. One of the best regions where this can be done effectively is in the region of Judaea/Palaestina. This area has been extensively and consistently excavated in the last century, with numerous sites and finds being constantly analysed and published. Due to this large number of sites with vast amounts of information, only the region of the north-western Negev, and the cities of Scythopolis and Jerusalem will be examined in detail, combined with a later examination of the Archaeological Survey of Israel. North-Western Negev Settlements A decrease in population in other parts of the Empire would create a decrease in the population of the arid regions, as people would move to recently vacated lands, which were safer and more fertile. Thus, such arid regions are considered good indicators of societal change, and so great emphasis was placed on their excava- or after: Sessa 2019, 236–237; henceforth, the current article will attempt to avoid searching and connecting events and drastic changes to famous dates, such as the 540’s or 636 CE. The proposed approach takes into consideration that history is composed of complex processes that continue for decades, and even centuries, and the initiating cause is not clear in all the processes. All the archaeological tools, such as radiocarbon dating, are in-line with this approach as the accuracy and range provided are in decades at best. The decline was a long process that started in the first half of the 7th c. CE and escalated around the middle of this century. However, this continued into the following two centuries albeit at a more moderate pace. As the current article will show, definitive and famous dates such as 636 CE need to be abandoned, as the decline started before, and the year 636 CE did not represent a turning point for the historic reality of the previous two decades. The Islamic conquest, and their wars with the Empire, were part of a long series of military conflicts that were part of the same process of wars and decline and was very similar to other wars. There- fore, they should not be used as the alleged starting point of settlement contraction. 35 Bar-Oz 2019, 8241, 8246–8247; Fuks 2020, 19780, 19787–19788.",

Fig. 1: Map of the north-western Negev and its vicinity with the city of Elusa and the settlements of Nessana and Shivta indicated. The map was created by using ArcGIS Pro 2.9.3. The site at the crux of the theory regarding the decline of this region is Elusa. Orig- inally a Nabatean waystation that was established in the 3rd c. BCE,37 it evolved into the main polis of the Roman Negev a few centuries later. The city prospered during the 4th to the 6th c. CE from its extensive agriculture and viticulture industry.38 The polis was surrounded by a number of large garbage mounds, and the surveying team conjectured that an abandonment of trash mounds could be an indicator of the breakdown of municipal facilities, societal collapse, and an emigration of people.39 Thus, a survey and an examination of the garbage mounds surrounding 36 Rubin 1998; Olshanetsky – Cosijns 2021, 8. 37 Bar-Oz 2019. 38 Rubin 1998; Lantos 2020. 39 Bar-Oz 2019, 8245; for research that used garbage mounds to examine societal processes, see: Rathje – Murphy 2001; Bar-Oz 2007; Spiciarich 2017.",

According to them, the polis and the sur- rounding settlements started to deteriorate in the mid-6th c. CE, and so this decline was attributed to the Justinianic plague and the LALIA.40 However, the methods of dating used by the NEGEVBYZ project were problematic. Regarding the radiocarbon dating, only eight botanical samples were dated from an area of more than thirteen hectares. In addition, five of these samples orig- inated from one excavation trench 1.3 m deep.41 Moreover, the samples were taken from areas which did not have an extensive representation of pottery sherds des- ignated to later dates, even though there were several areas on the trash mounds with large quantities of such sherds. The radiocarbon dating of organic samples from such areas would have been best suited for understanding the last use of the trash mounds, but this did not occur.42 Furthermore, the botanical sample from probe 22 was claimed to indicate that the end use of the mound happened in the mid-6th c. CE. However, the full date range of this sample is 425 to 580 CE.43 The fact that the dating of the botanical sample was rounded down, and the full range of dates was not provided in the article, is not the only problem with this dating.44 When inputting the radiocarbon data into the newly updated OxCal (a program used to calibrate radiocarbon dates),45 a version that was unavailable to the NEGEVBYZ project in 2019, the dates for all the samples were pushed forward, with the new dating for probe 22 being 435 to 597 CE at 95.4 % probability.46 A further analysis of the dates using the mathematical modelling function in the OxCal program was also implemented.47 In this case, the raw dates of the eight samples were entered into a single-phase model to try and calculate the possible end date of the garbage mounds, something the original publication neglected to do. According to the model, the end use of the mound fell within a large range of 476 to 681 CE at 95.4 % probability, or 515 to 599 CE at 68.3 % probability.48 It is important to note that the dating and modelling are so imprecise due to the severe lack of dates for such a large area. Moreover, the samples were taken from places where there were 40 Bar-Oz 2019, 8239, 8246–8247; Fuks 2020, 19780, 19787–19789; Langgut 2021, 174. 41 Bar-Oz 2019, 8244, Fig. 5. 42 Regarding the location of the later pottery sherds, see: Bar-Oz 2019, 8244, Fig. 4; regarding the location of the probes from which the C14 dates were obtained, and their relation to the different survey squares, see: Bar-Oz 2019, 8241, Fig. 2. 43 Bar-Oz 2019, 8244 Fig. 5, SI Table S6. 44 Bar-Oz 2019, 8243. 45 Bronk Ramsey 2009; Reimer 2020. 46 Olshanetsky – Cosijns 2023, Fig. 1a. 47 This was not conducted by the NEGEVBYZ project. 48 Olshanetsky – Cosijns 2023, Fig. 3.",

Consequently, it is safe to argue that the radi- ocarbon dates, be they modelled or unmodelled, and especially when considering their limited number, do not prove that the garbage mounds ceased to be used in 550 CE. The second dating method used to complement and strengthen the radio- carbon dating of the garbage mounds was ceramic typology, which was entirely based on a 1995 article by Majcherek describing the dating of Gaza jars.49 In Elusa, vast numbers of Gaza jar sherds were found, especially from those belonging to Majcherek’s Type 2 and Type 3. According to Majcherek, Type 2 represents the 4th to the end of the 5th c. CE, while Type 3 was in production from the end of the 5th until the beginning of the 7th c. CE, with a peak in its production after 535 CE.50 More updated typologies of this jar, which is also called the Late Roman Amphora 4 (LRA 4), have slightly amended Majcherek’s dating. Pieri divided Majcherek’s Type 2 into two separate typologies, one dated to the 4th and 5th c. CE called LRA 4A2,51 and the other dated to the second third of the 5th c. to the first half of the 6th c. CE, known as LRA 4B1.52 Majcherek’s Type 3, reclassified as LRA 4B2, was re-dated to the beginning of the second half of the 6th c. to the 7th c. CE.53 Sazanov attempted to further improve on this classification and categorised the vessels into smaller sub-categories.54 Conversely, the team at Elusa incorrectly assigned Type 3 to Levantine archaeology’s Middle Byzantine period (450 to 550 CE).55 Additionally, as stated by Majcherek, vessels are often used long after their production has ceased,56 as usable jars and vessels were not discarded simply because they were no longer produced. Therefore, it is safe to assume that Type 3 was still used extensively in the first quarter of the 7th c. CE and later, until the Islamic conquest of 636, and possibly even a few decades after. Hence, Type 3 represents the norm during the end of the Middle and all of the Late Byzantine archaeological periods in the Levant. Accord- ingly, the ceramic record suggests a longer and prosperous habitation of the region, rather than a deterioration in the mid-6th c. CE.57 49 Majcherek 1995, 168–169. 50 Majcherek 1995, 168–169. 51 Pieri 2005, 104, n.209. 52 Pieri 2005, 106, n.252. 53 Pieri 2005, 106, n.269. 54 Sazanov 2017. 55 Bar-Oz 2019, 8243. 56 Majcherek 1995, 168–169. 57 Cosijns – Olshanetsky 2022, 7–9; Olshanetsky – Cosijns 2023.",
              "Challenging the Significance of the LALIA and the Justinianic Plague 731 This is supported by the large concentration of pottery sherds from the Late Byzantine i.e., from post 550 CE,58 which were found in squares VII–IX of the survey that was conducted on the garbage mounds of Elusa.59 The ceramic concentration in these squares was larger than any other found in the other survey squares, and was highly unusual. Thus, these squares may have been the last areas where garbage disposal was practiced, and it strongly suggests that this continued well into the 7th c. CE,60 and indicates that the cessation in municipal services occurred only in the 7th c. CE.61 This lends weight to discoveries that show a shift in the ratio of pottery typol- ogies in the Negev, showing a drastic increase in the number of sherds, and espe- cially the percentage of bag-shaped jars, compared to a decrease in the percentage of Gaza jar sherds, especially in the assemblages of Shivta (Sobota) and Nessana. According to the NEGEVBYZ project, Gaza jars were used only for trade, and were especially built to be transported on camels and ships, while bag-shaped jars were used for storage.62 This, alongside a change in the ratio between grain seeds and grape pips in different contexts, had brought them to say that the decrease in Gaza jar sherds correlates with a change in agricultural produce.63 However, bag-shaped jars had a dual purpose and were also used for trade.64 Their sherds can be found in large quantities throughout the Empire, similar to the dissemination of Gaza jars (Fig. 2).65 Moreover, there is a stark increase in the total number of sherds found after 550 CE, possibly indicating an increase in the industrial capacity and prosperity of the region. This is especially noticeable in Area A in Nessana, which was dated to 550 to 700 CE, where a total of 16,148 sherds were found, a larger number than all the other areas and contexts from all the sites combined.66 Such a number can be used to support a population peak in the early 7th c. CE, or it can be characterised as untrustworthy and possibly anomalous. In terms of yield change, grape pips were found in higher numbers from con- texts dated to after the mid-6th c. CE than in previous periods. Thus, it is definitely not a reliable indication of a decline in the viticulture industry, nor sufficient evi- 58 This definition is according to the NEGEBYZ project typology. 59 Bar-Oz 2019, SI Table S3(B). 60 C14 dating was not conducted in these survey squares, albeit the ceramic there was of a later date, and it is the place where an end-use of the garbage mound can be properly established. 61 Olshanetsky – Cosijns 2022; 2023. 62 Fuks 2020, 19783. 63 Fuks 2020, 19783. 64 Mango 2001, 50; Kingsley 2004, 118; Pieri 2005, 114–125. 65 Reynolds 1995, 71–72; Pieri 2005, 114–125. 66 Fuks 2020, SI Table 3.",

Furthermore, most of the botanical finds were dated to post-550 CE,68 which can indicate that the peak in agricultural production occurred in the late 6th or the 7th c. CE, or possibly accidental. Additionally, the dating of the data from Shivta, Elusa and the other Negev sites, needs to be amended. As elaborated previ- ously, what was dated to 450 to 550 CE should be at least redated to 475 to 636 CE or 550–650 CE, if not later. During this period, the grape pip percentage of the cereal and grape assemblages reported in the middens of Shivta and Elusa sites was 42 % and 43 %, respectively, making it the phase with the largest percentage of grape pips. As a result, it implies the highest period of viticulture output was at least until, and in the first few decades following, the Islamic conquest. The shift in the pottery and botanical assemblage ratios can be explained by the Roman-Persian wars, which severed trade routes, curtailed the sale of commod- ities, and constricted the market. It may also have compelled a conversion from Gaza jars to bag-shaped jars in the hope that the produce could be stored, and the conflict would finish shortly so that the product could be sold. Bag-shaped jars were chosen because they were easier to store than Gaza jars but could still be used for transportation. The Islamic Conquest prolonged and exacerbated the degradation of trade and markets, potentially driving many farmers to bankruptcy. It is plausi- ble to infer that conflicts and trade restrictions also encouraged many farmers to switch from growing grapes to growing grain, as grain, despite being less profitable, was easier to store for longer durations. This transition may have caused a decrease in the area’s prosperity, as well as the deterioration and eventual abandonment of the sites in the following decades. Another option is that the Gaza jars were less prevalent in the Negev after the wars reached the area, as the vessels arrived, most likely filled, from the coastal region.69 As the Negev settlements’ ability to import products decreased, so did the quantity of imported vessels and the ability to reuse them for export. Consequently, the Negev villages began to increase the local manufacturing of bag-shaped jars.70 This theory could be tested further by examining the colour of the sherds and deter- mining their origins. 67 It is not even certain if wine export was the main income for the region: Seligman 2020. 68 Fuks 2020, SI Table 2. 69 Pieri 2005; Erickson-Gini 2022. 70 Gaza jars are exclusively imported and are not local to the Negev desert, as their colour ranges from pink to reddish yellow: Pieri 2005; on the other hand, numerous bag-shaped jars found in the Negev were locally produced, with a distinct pale yellow colour, although only some were defined as “Elusa ware”: Erickson-Gini 2022, 185 (Fig. 47); Erickson-Gini – Mamalya 2022, 155–157.",
              "734 Haggai Olshanetsky – Lev Cosijns The decline of the area drove traders and farmers into bankruptcy. Since pigeons were raised for their faeces, which was used as fertilizer, the abandon- ment of pigeon towers in the Negev could be an indication for that decline.71 In a recent article of the NEGEVBYZ project, pigeon bones from several towers were radiocarbon dated, providing a range of dates in the second half of the 6th c. and the beginning of the 7th c. CE, suggesting that the decline occurred in the 7th c. CE.72 Like the case of Elusa, a meagre number of tests were done, and so these dates are not enough to conclusively prove and provide exact dates. For example, only three bones were examined in Horvat Saadon, with date ranges of 430–585 CE, 430–600 CE and 440–640 CE at 95.4 % probability.73 According to these results, it is possible that the use of these facilities in Horvat Saadon continued into the late 6th c. and even the 7th c. CE, such as in other places. The finds in other towers in Shivta and Beer Sheba provided later dates, which can indicate a decline in the 7th c. CE, whose causes are most likely connected to the general deterioration of com- merce and wealth due to the Persian war and the Islamic conquest, as the NEGEBYZ project pointed out itself.74 The presented data, including a reinterpretation of the radiocarbon dates and the ceramic typology of the north-western Negev settlements, indicate that the decline, economic deterioration, and partial abandonment of the region most prob- ably occurred from the 7th c. CE. This is corroborated by the presence of certain ceramic typologies originating from the east, and Judaea/Palaestina in particular, throughout the Mediterranean. These vessels, namely Gaza jars (LRA 4) and bag- shaped jars (LRA 5), were widely found in multiple sites, such as Marseille, Naples, Carthage, eastern Spain and Alexandria, from contexts dating to the end of the 6th and the first decades of the 7th c. CE.75 According to the archaeological record, there was a collapse in the presence of these vessels from the early to the mid-7th c. CE. This implies that trade in the eastern Roman Empire reached a height in the late 6th and beginning of the 7th c. CE. The further implications are that both the settlements in Judaea/Palaestina, as well as in the rest of the Roman east, were at the pinnacle of their industrial capabilities, and provided commodities to the entire Mediterra- nean basin during this period. The communities of the north-western Negev also relied on the export and contents of these vessels (LRA 4 and LRA 5), as is evident by the number of their 71 Regarding pigeon tower abandonment, see: Tepper 2018; Yan 2021. 72 This conclusion is derived from our own examination of the dates, and so differs in parts from what is stated in the article: Yan 2021. 73 Yan 2021, 1726. 74 Yan 2021, 1731–1732. 75 Reynolds 1995, 155–160.",

This, as well as other evidence, suggests there was a peak in the pros- perity and welfare in the sites of the Negev in the late 6th and early 7th c. CE. This is substantiated by the corpus of papyri and inscriptions from Nessana, most of which are dated to before the Islamic conquest. Their contents show that Nessana and its surroundings reached a maximum in size and population in the late 6th and early 7th c. CE.76 Other evidence for the region’s later prosperity comes from the dedicatory inscriptions for buildings and new mosaics from within Negev settlements, such as the mosaic floor in the church in Shivta from the year 607 CE.77 Both the construc- tion of new buildings and the instalment of new mosaics are considered as major indicators of wealth and economic prosperity. To summarise, there is no clear evidence for a decline in the north-western Negev region in the 6th c. CE, whether from Elusa’s garbage mounds, the region’s pigeon towers, or other archaeological data. Rather, the evidence suggests that there was continuity in everyday life and that the decline occurred from the 7th c. CE. This suggests that neither climate nor the Justinianic Plague played a role in the region’s collapse. Conversely, the region’s decline was caused by a long period of warfare between the Romans and the Persians, and later the Arabs, which destroyed the trade routes to and from the north-western Negev desert. Cities in Judaea/Palaestina Further examples of demographic and economic decline dated to the 7th c. CE can be seen in archaeological sites from the centre of Judaea/Palaestina. An example for this can be found in Scythopolis, where the public buildings were so neglected during the 7th c. CE that they were dismantled by the public for use as building materials.78 This is also visible in other archaeological sites, such as the cities of Yavne-Yam, Yavne, and Emmaus, and various other agricultural settlements in their vicinity.79 The causes of this societal and economic collapse can be explained by the deterioration of the trade routes and economy as a result of the region’s political control changing multiple times in a relatively short time period. In addi- tion, the new rulers of the region were in an almost constant state of war with the late Eastern Roman Empire, and the local population possibly fled to what was left under the rule of the Emperor in Constantinople. Therefore, due to extensive 76 Magness 2003, 179–180. 77 Sivan 2008, 83–84. 78 Tsafrir – Foerster 1997, 145; Avni 2010, 44. 79 Taxel 2013.",

CE as the Persian and Islamic conquests of the city did not destroy the infrastruc- ture of the city.81 This may have been due to the importance of the city as a seat of power in the area and an important administrative centre.82 However, there are discoveries of mass graves in Jerusalem dated to the Persian conquest, which are also mentioned in ancient texts. These texts show that the Christians were marched out of the city to be killed, and so there are few visible signs of destruction in the city itself.83 The Macro-Scale Data As is evident on the micro-scale, there was no apparent deterioration which can be attributed to a change in the climate or society in the 6th c. CE in the north-western Negev, and in the regions of Jerusalem, Scythopolis and Yavne. To fully determine whether the examined regions were the exception or the norm, it is important to compare this information with what occurred during this period in larger regions and other areas. Shipwreck Analysis The first type of information that can provide a broader picture is an analysis of shipwreck data, based on two well-known databases: the shipwreck database of Harvard University,84 and the Oxford Roman Economy Project (OXREP) data- 80 One of the greatest problems in archaeology is to understand what happened to the people when there is no evidence of a destruction layer, or when mass graves are not found. A main argu- ment against the high mortality of the Justinianic plague is that mass graves linked to the plague are scarce. On the other hand, the Persian war contains evidence for mass graves, although it is not feasible to suggest that the population of the area was decimated due to war as, similar to other wars, refugees and expulsion are common. Exactly where these refugees travelled to is, at the moment, unclear in the archaeological record. 81 Avni 2010. 82 The Muslims, and especially the Persians, tried to maintain civility and preserve the previously established administrative system: Foss 2003, 58, 62–63. 83 Tchalenko 1953, 55; Avni 2010. 84 The Harvard database was taken from: McCormick 2020.",

However, the biggest impediment to easily inter- preting this data is a lack of information on the body of water from which the ship came. Consequently, this information was completed, with the combined dataset including the body of water in which each shipwreck was found. This enabled the easy exclusion of ships that were not discovered in the Mediterranean Sea. But why do shipwrecks matter? The use of this type of data implements a method that has recently been applied in different studies, such as Justin Leid- wanger’s latest book.87 This method assumes that the number of shipwrecks has statistical significance, and greater amounts of maritime traffic are reflected in higher numbers of shipwrecks in certain periods. As the number of ships in use increases, so does the probability that some of them will sink due to storms and other calamities. Generally, the comparison of the number of shipwrecks between half-centuries and centuries is considered acceptable and common, and is an impor- tant tool in understanding the volume of sea-borne trade. The assumption at the foundation of this system is that unique catastrophic events leading to numerous ships sinking simultaneously are short-lived and rare, and a comparison between long periods neutralises the distinctive effect of such calamities.88 The main obstacle in employing shipwrecks is the difficulty in exactly estab- lishing the date of the ship’s sinking. As a result, in most cases, only broad estimates are available, ranging from a few decades to many centuries, depending on the type and extent of investigation undertaken on the shipwreck by surveyors and/ or excavators, as well as the artefacts uncovered. To compensate for this difficulty, the full date range of each shipwreck was inputted into the graph. Thus, a ship can appear in multiple columns. This method is not entirely accurate, but it provides a valuable and universal picture, although with some deviation.89 The outcome of this method is that the sum of all the columns would vastly outnumber the number of ships appearing in the database. Leidwanger presented similar raw figures in his book. However, the number of ships he examined was less than what will be presented here.90 Henceforth, the data in this article will be the most comprehen- 85 The OXREP database was taken from: Strauss 2013. 86 For the Harvard and OXREP databases, before their unification and without a column explicitly detailing from which body of water the ship came from, see: http://oxrep.classics.ox.ac.uk/data- bases/shipwrecksdatabase, last accessed 21.03.2023. 87 Leidwanger 2020, 110–153. 88 Leidwanger 2020, 13–14, 113. 89 Wilson 2009, 33–34. 90 In Leidwanger’s book, there is a chance that there is a mistake in the graphs, as the sum of all the columns were smaller or similar to the number of ships that, according to Leidwanger, were",

As Rome gradually united the entire Mediterranean Sea, and the Mediterranean truly became a mare nostrum, naval traffic and trade became safer and easier, leading to a surge in commerce during the relatively peaceful 1st c. CE.92 In addition, the thrill of suddenly available exotic commodities boosted this peak in naval commerce.93 With the possible novelty of the exported goods wearing off, there is a decline in the number of shipwrecks in the 2nd c. CE. Fig. 3: Graph showing the number of shipwrecks per period in the Mediterranean according to the Harvard and OXREP databases. included in the graphs. As was explained, the sum should have been significantly larger, than the number of ships that were inputted into the graph: Leidwanger 2020, 116, Graph 4.2. 91 For the Harvard and OXREP databases, before their unification and without a column explicitly detailing from which body of water the ship came from, see: http://oxrep.classics.ox.ac.uk/data- bases/shipwrecks_database, last accessed 21.03.2023. 92 Regarding the defeat of Antonius and Cleopatra at Actium in 31 BCE as marking the unification of the entire Mediterranean under Roman rule, and its implications on trade and the term mare nostrum, see, for example: Carter 1970; Gruen 2005; Eck 2007; Goldsworthy 2014; Fratantuono 2016. 93 Regarding the boost in demand for exotic goods, see: Bobou 2021, 158.",
              "Challenging the Significance of the LALIA and the Justinianic Plague 739 However, from the 2nd c. to the end of the 5th c. CE, the number of shipwrecks remained consistent and near to what was seen at the end of the Republic, implying that this was a regular level of naval trade during full Roman control of the entire Mediter- ranean. Then, at the very end of the 5th c. CE, there is a sharp decline of almost fifty percent in shipwreck numbers. The reason for such a severe reduction was most probably due to the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the late 5th c. CE.94 The fall of the west also symbolised the decline of the city of Rome and other western trade cities and their hinterlands, and their subsequent reduction in population. Later, stability in the number of shipwrecks can be seen in the 6th c. CE, followed by a decline from the 7th c. CE onwards. This decline was most probably an outcome of the Persian war, and the Islamic conquest shortly after, which deprived Constantinople of most of the territories that were previously under the rule of the Eastern Roman Empire. These events damaged the trade networks between the former regions of the Empire, as well as between the eastern and western sides of the Mediterranean. When comparing the trends of shipwrecks in the entire Mediterranean to the eastern Mediterranean, and when contrasting the two sides of this sea, this image becomes clearer, and the contrasts between the eastern and western Mediterranean become more pronounced (Fig. 4 and 5).95 This was done to eliminate the numerical bias of the shipwreck data, as more research was conducted in the western Medi- terranean, and the original data is focused mainly on this area. In the eastern Mediterranean, there was an increase in maritime traffic in the last two centuries BCE. This increase reached a peak in the 1st c. CE, similar to what is visible in the Mediterranean as a whole. However, contrary to the general trend, after a slight decrease there was stability in the 2nd and 3rd c. CE, followed by a continued increase in the number of shipwrecks which reached a peak in the late 5th c. CE, with this trend continuing until the beginning of the 7th c. CE. This peak was even greater than the one in the 1st c. CE, demonstrating the Eastern Roman Empire’s stability as well as the potential that trade was even more robust in the region during Late Antiquity. The peak in eastern Mediterranean trade continued at least until 600 CE, and so implies that there was no decline in the mid-6th c. CE.96 94 Regarding the fall of the Western Roman Empire, see: Heather 2005, 385–459; Ward-Perkins 2005, 138–146; Wickham 2005, 33–34; Elton 2018, 195–244. 95 The line of separation between the eastern and western Mediterranean was decided according to longitude 20. All the ships that were found along the Mediterranean coastline of Greece, Cyprus, Turkey, Lebanon, Syria, Israel, Egypt and the eastern part of Libya were defined as shipwrecks from the eastern Mediterranean. Alongside these, ships which were found and surveyed in Medi- terranean international waters east of longitude 20 were also defined as such. 96 Both McCormick and Avni wrongly concentrate on the western Mediterranean when discussing a decline in trade in the 6th c.

              "Challenging the Significance of the LALIA and the Justinianic Plague 741 This stability in maritime trade in both the Mediterranean as a whole, and specifically the eastern Mediterranean during the 6th c. CE, diminishes the argu- ments of different researchers who have claimed that the Justinianic plague and the LALIA were major factors in the breakdown of the Eastern Roman Empire. In addition, following the 6th c. CE, there is a fall in the number of shipwrecks during the 7th c. CE in both the Mediterranean as a whole, and the eastern Mediterranean in particular. Such a trend highlights that the deterioration of naval commerce occurred in the 7th c. CE and was most probably connected to the Roman-Persian War of 602–628,97 and the Islamic conquests that started in 636.98 The Arab wars with the empire further deteriorated the situation and hampered commerce well after the 7th c. CE.99 Since the shipwreck data is based on dating, which provides a range rather than precise years, it is crucial to note and demonstrate that this information and con- clusions are consistent with other evidence. These include the quantitative analysis of settlement trends in Judaea/Palaestina, a comparison with other regions, and other previously discussed and soon to be analysed findings. Archaeological Survey of Israel The Archaeological Survey of Israel is the most thorough archaeological survey conducted in a country. The entire country was carefully divided into survey grids of 100 km2 (10x10 km) in the early 1960s, with each grid being published as a survey map,100 of which 70 % have been surveyed and published since the 1960s.101 Each map was published after a team of archaeologists systematically surveyed the area on foot, and methodically inspected every square metre of the grid where possible. Individual teams plotted, marked, and noted any site with signs of anthropogenic activity, as well as dated the site where possible using indicative sherds or other artefacts. Upon the completion of a survey, the team would include a summary and analysis of the various periods identified in the survey grid, as well as their conclusions concerning changes in settlement patterns, the date of these changes, and their possible causes. 97 Regarding the war, see: Foss 2003; Howard-Johnston 2006; Avni 2010; Pourshariati 2017. 98 Regarding the Islamic conquest, see: Butler – Fraser 1978; Nicolle 1994; Ibrahim 2002; Mikhail 2016. 99 Kaegi 1992; Fouracre 2008; Sarris 2011; Donner 2014. 100 Dagan 2009, 222; Sion 2014; Authority 2022. 101 For the full list of survey maps, see note 105.",

Some of them were more organised and straightforward, while others were less so. The information from all the mentioned surveys was collected, and a quantitative analysis of the number of settlements from the Hellenistic to the Early Islamic period was conducted.105 Fig. 6: Graph indicating the number of sites per period in modern-day Israel. 102 Dagan 2010; Dagan 2011. 103 Kochavi 1972. 104 Zertal 2004, 2008; Zertal – Mirkam 2016; Zertal – Bar 2017, 2019; Bar – Zertal 2021, 2022. 105 The current research and graphs include data from the Beth Shemesh survey, the 1967–1968 salvage survey, all the volumes of the Manasseh Hill Country survey published up until now (note 79), as well as the following maps in the Israel survey: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 11, 11/1, 15, 15/1, 18, 18/1, 18/2, 18/3, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 36/1, 36/2, 36/3, 39, 40, 40/1, 41, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 52, 53, 54, 56, 57, 58, 59, 61, 62, 63, 64, 66/67, 69, 70/71, 72, 76, 77, 78, 80, 82, 83, 83/1, 83/2, 83/12, 84, 85, 87, 88, 89, 91, 92, 96, 98, 101, 102, 104, 105, 106, 108/2, 109/4, 109/5, 109/7, 110, 112, 114, 120, 121, 125, 127/128, 129, 131, 132, 136, 139, 140, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 153, 154, 155, 156, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 177, 178, 183, 187, 193, 194, 195, 196, 198, 199, 200, 201, 202, 203, 204, 206, 207, 212, 213, 214, 216, 217, 219, 220, 224, 225, 234, 238, 255, 256, 257/259, 258, 260, 261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266.",
              "Challenging the Significance of the LALIA and the Justinianic Plague 743 Figure 6 represents the overall quantitative analysis of the survey results,106 and a significant increase in the number of sites with anthropogenic activity is visible during the Early Roman period (red-brown), defined as the mid-1st c. BCE until the beginning of the 4th c. CE. In this period, the number of sites more than tripled compared to the Hellenistic period (column in grey representing the end of the 4th c. BCE until the mid-1st c. BCE). More significant is the continuous increase in the number of sites from the Early Roman to the Late Roman period (blue column which represents the early 4th c. to the early 7th c. CE). This 61.77 % increase over the preceding period establishes the Late Roman period as a high point in the number of sites in Judaea/Palaestina, which was only surpassed in the 20th c. CE. The sub- stantial increase points to a well-documented population explosion that happened throughout the Eastern Roman Empire. However, this settlement boom ended in the 7th c. CE, followed by a protracted period of decline in the number of sites and population. Thus, when did the number of settlements peak between the 4th to the begin- ning of the 7th c. CE? There was a severe contraction, and the number of active sites during Early Islamic period was fewer than a third of what had previously been active under the reign of the Eastern Roman Empire. If the peak arrived in the mid-6th c. CE, the decline in the number of sites can be tied to the LALIA and the Justinianic plague. On the other hand, a decline in the 7th c. CE would indicate that climate and plague most probably did not majorly contribute, and the main reasons for this deterioration was manmade – the Roman-Persian wars and the Islamic conquest. Fortunately, the surveyors left plenty of information that can help determine the timing of the fall. Numerous surveyors indicated that it is possible that there were more Early Islamic settlements than what was indicated in the maps and surveys, as the pottery found was of the types that may have continued several decades into the Early Islamic period. Hence, it seems that the Byzantine (Late Roman) ceramic, and many of the identified Byzantine (Late Roman) sites can be dated to the Late Byzantine period (550–636 CE). These observations prompted researchers, such as Gideon Avni, to define settlements with such assemblages as Byzantine-Early Islamic in the surveys they conducted,107 defining hundreds of sites as such.108 Furthermore, many surveyors saw the cause of the said decline as the Islamic conquest, and they believed that this decline continued throughout the 106 There were several previous studies which partially analysed the archaeological surveys of Israel: Avner 2006; Holzer 2010; Avni 2014, 192–300; Nol 2022, 48–88. 107 Avni 2014, 191–353. 108 The said maps are from the surveys in the Negev desert, and Avni took part in many of them: 193, 198, 199, 200, 202, 206, 207, 224, 225.",

Today, the accepted opinion is that in most of the Byzantine sites, the finds are from the later period,112 and their use continued into the first decades of the Early Islamic period.113 Moreover, a re-examination of some of the survey squares in the Galilee was conducted, alongside a new survey, excavations and dozens of test pits and probes. This examination showed that the original survey finds stand the test of time and a more thorough examination, and the reliability of this data is high.114 It is important to note that the survey finds for a single site may be inaccurate, but the survey as a whole is accurate in detecting general changes and trends in large regions – the type of research and debate that the current article wishes to conduct. To conclude, the ceramic typologies that were found in the different sites caused the different researchers and surveyors to assume that settlement decline occurred in the 7th c. CE and occurred due to the wars and geopolitical changes which transpired during this period. This hypothesis that claims the effects of the Justinianic plague and the LALIA were limited, and minimal, and anthropogenic activities and war were the main causes, is also supported by other evidence. For 109 Regarding such claims, and references to pottery of the type that continued from the Byzan- tine to the Early Islamic, see maps: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 15/1, 18, 18/2, 18/3, 20, 22, 24, 28, 29, 36/1, 39, 41, 44, 49, 54, 56, 57, 59, 80, 82, 83, 87, 88, 89, 96, 98, 101, 102, 109, 120, 125, 127, 128, 136, 139, 140, 162, 164, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 172, 173, 174, 177, 178, 193, 194, 195, 196, 225. 110 The maps are 18/1; in map 213 the collapse was attributed to earthquakes which happened in 501 and 502, or the Justinianic plague. 111 There are those who claimed that the reason for this is that when the surveys were pub- lished, there was insufficient awareness for the Justinianic plague, and the debate around this only became more prominent in the last two decades, while the definition and the debate around the LALIA is the outcome of the last few years. However, this awareness should not change the dating of the pottery. In order for these two phenomena to be significant, the dating of the decline and abandonment needs to be in the 6th c. CE, and not in the 7th c. CE. The fact that the surveyors did not feel that the decline occurred in the 6th c. but rather in the 7th c. CE still stands. Furthermore, it is important to note that many of the surveys, including the Beth Shemesh survey, the Manasseh Hill Country surveys, and many of the Israel survey maps, have been conducted and published in the last decade, when the awareness of these two phenomena was constantly increasing. Yet, no change in the finds or the conclusions of the surveyors can be seen. 112 Sivan 2008, 89–91. 113 Avni 2014, 191–353. 114 Franḳel 2001.",

CE in modern-day Israel and Jordan. While a decrease in the number of such finds occurred briefly in the fifth decade of the 6th c. CE, it was immediately followed by a full recovery, inferring that the effects of the Justinianic plague or the LALIA were short and minimal in the Eastern Roman Empire. On the other hand, a sharper decrease in these dated inscriptions can be found in the 7th c. CE due to the Persian war. Even though there was a slight recuperation the following decade after 628 CE, when Rome recovered the area, an even sharper decline was visible after the Islamic conquest of 636 CE, after which there was no recovery.115 The trend of stability in terms of the number of inscriptions in the 6th c. CE can also be seen when looking at the eastern Medi- terranean basin as a whole.116 Thus, the decline and abandonment of settlements in the Late Eastern Roman Empire most probably needs to be dated to the 7th c. CE and not to the 6th c. CE. Archaeological Surveys and Excavations in Turkey, Cyprus, and Greece Evidence for this trend can also be seen in surveys and excavations in some regions of Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey).117 During the Late Roman period (325–636 CE), for example, the Maeander Valley saw a rise in agricultural acreage, population, and settlement size.118 Similar trends were also seen in Phrygia,119 Miletus,120 Saga- lassos,121 and the Troad.122 Moreover, several recent works have emphasised and demonstrated that an increase in population occurred in many regions of the Ana- tolian countryside in the 4th c. CE, and that this pattern persisted until the mid-7th c. CE in several phases.123 115 Di Segni 1999, 159–163. 116 Mordechai 2019, 25549–25550. 117 Regarding the general topic on increase in the size of the population, and an increase in the use of new territories for agriculture, and the foundation of new settlements in the region: Heather 2018, 60. 118 Thonemann 2011, 55, 259. 119 Niewöhner 2013, 60. 120 Niewöhner 2011, 109. 121 Vanhaverbeke 2021, 258–260, 272. 122 Cook 1973; Rose 2011, 164; Cook claimed that there was a decrease in maritime traffic, yet the data presented in the current article, which contains information that he did not possess, disprove this suggestion. 123 Roberts 2018, 312.",

CE, was devoid of any climatic change, be it an increase or decrease in temperature or precipitation. Yet, during the second phase of this trend, from the mid-6th to the 7th c. CE, there was an increase in population density that was only matched in modern times and is comparable to the demographic fluorescence in Judaea/Palaestina and other Mediterranean basin regions. This second phase of growth overlapped with a colder period and higher precipitation, which coincides with the LALIA. While the LALIA is commonly thought to be between 550 and 660 CE at most, this colder and wetter period lasted until the mid-8th century CE. Such a climate was reputedly ideal, which may have contributed to the expansion in population and agricultural industry witnessed in other sections of the Mediterranean. Even though there was no change in climate in the mid-7th c. CE, the number of sites and the regional pollen record decreased.124 This decline, like in other regions, was driven by anthropogenic elements. War ravaged the land, decimating trade, which was especially destructive in Anatolia, as it became the principal border zone between the Byzantine Empire, which arose from the ashes of the Eastern Roman Empire, and the Islamic Caliphates.125 Another notable example is the archaeological excavations and surveys carried out in Cyprus. From them, it is clear that a peak in the number of settlements, and in many cases in their size, occurred between the 5th and 7th c. CE. The scholars emphasised in numerous places that the peak must be dated to the end of the 6th c. or the beginning of the 7th c. CE, and that the decline began only in the mid-7th c. CE in most regions, and lasted for a very long time after.126 The same can be seen in Greece, with many areas declining only in the 7th c. CE. This is evident from the archaeological surveys conducted in Greece, which can generally be split into two main groups. The first is surveys where there is a peak in habitation during the Classical and Hellenistic period, a decrease between the Hellenistic and Early Roman followed by centuries of stability until the end of the Late Roman period. The second is a gradual increase in habitation which reached a peak in the Late Roman period. An unequivocal trend, visible in almost all the surveys, is a stark decline in the 7th and/or 8th c. CE, as can be seen in Laconia,127 124 Roberts 2018, 313–315; Maranzana 2021, 566. 125 Roberts 2018, 319–320. 126 Regarding Dhiorios-Mersineri, see: Rautman 2021, 194; regarding the district of Famagusta, see: Rautman 2021, 194–195; on the Vasilikos Valley: Todd 2013, 106–109; Rautman 2021, 202–205; it is important to note that in Cyprus, there was a tide of constructing new churches in the 5th and the 6th c.

CE cannot merely be associated with an unfamiliarity with the ceramic assemblage, as the material culture of the 6th to 8th c. CE in most of the Greek sub-regions is well understood.132 Thus, this decrease is due to an aban- donment of territories and sites. However, there is a chance that some of the sites that were considered abandoned were not necessarily so.133 The decline in population can be seen not only through the abandonment of sites, but also through other finds such as the decrease in the size of the Basilica at Perissa in Santorini in the 8th c. CE.134 It is true that the number of sites that continued after this period is greater than what was presumed in the past, yet the severe decline in the size of the population is undoubtable.135 In general, the 7th c. CE saw the newly transformed Byzantine Empire reorganise their holdings in the Aegean region, and heavily invest in fortifications throughout these islands. While there was a decline in population in several areas of Greece, Gortyn in Crete saw an increase, visible in the division of larger buildings to create new public and private spaces, as well as the construction of a new church.136 While it is relatively established that a decline in settlement size and number occurred in the 7th or 8th c. CE in Turkey, Cyprus and Greece, this region saw numer- ous events in the 6th c. CE which should and could have caused a deterioration of the area. One of the most concrete examples is the tsunamigenic earthquakes in the middle of the 6th c. CE.137 However, instead there was rapid renovation and reju- venation of the region, especially in the port of Kos in Greece,138 and Beirut in Le- banon.139 Such rapid recovery and rejuvenation of cities after devastating natural disasters is substantial evidence of an economically resilient and demographically stable Empire, which was possibly at its strongest. 128 Bowden – Gill 1997b, 77–78; 1997a, 84–85; Koukoulis 1997, 97. 129 Bintliff – Snodgrass 1985, 157–160. 130 Jameson 1994, 224, 229–243. 131 Forsén 2003, 264; Forsén – Karivieri 2003, 310–312. 132 Armstrong 1996, 352. 133 Poulou 2023. 134 Poulou 2023, 19–20. 135 Poulou 2023. 136 Poulou 2023, 26–27. 137 Elias 2007. 138 Poulou 2023, 22. 139 Hall 2004, 70–76.",
              "748 Haggai Olshanetsky – Lev Cosijns Archaeological Surveys in North Africa North Africa is divided into two distinct regions. Egypt lies on one side, with mod- ern-day Tunisia, Libya, Algeria, and Morocco on the other. Egypt is typically dif- ferentiated because it is greatly influenced by the Nile, whose sources depend on the monsoons of the Indian Ocean.140 During the late 2nd to the 5th c. CE in southern Egypt (Upper Egypt), there is a well-documented fall in the number of sites and population.141 Conversely, the northern part of Egypt (Lower Egypt), comprising the Nile Delta and Alexandria, had a boom in population and settlements from the 4th to the 7th c. CE.142 This corresponds and is verified by what can be seen in other countries of the Mediterranean basin, and supports the notion that a population fall did not occur in the 6th c. CE due to the Justinianic plague, but rather in the 7th c. CE due to warfare, and the deterioration of trade. The rest of North Africa is another important region for understanding the changes occurring in the mid-6th to the early 8th c. CE due to its unique history.143 Compared to the climate of Egypt, the other regions of Northern Africa are part of the Mediterranean climate zone. This region saw frequent changes in control from the early 5th until the 8th c. CE, with the Vandal invasion ending the Late Roman period in 429 CE.144 Their Kingdom lasted over a century before being deposed by the Eastern Roman Expeditionary force led by Belisarius, who was dispatched by Emperor Justinian I. Following a year of warfare, the conflict concluded with the Vandals’ ultimate surrender in 534 CE.145 These changes in governance corre- sponded to the settlement of people in the newly conquered regions, who carried their own distinct material culture with them, synthesising with the local one. As a result, these changes are readily visible in the archaeological record, and so distinct and relatively short periods of time may be recognized using the ceramic assem- blage. The lands of North Africa were ruled by the Late Eastern Roman Empire from 534 CE until the Islamic conquest in the late 7th c. CE, a period known in archaeology as the Byzantine period.146 As a result, the Islamic period is usually defined only from 689 CE.147 Therefore, due to the Byzantine archaeological period coinciding 140 Mahmoud – Gan 2020. 141 Peacock 2006, 137–139; Sidebotham 2011, 259–260. 142 Alston 1999, 138–141; Wilson – Grigoropoulos 2009; Kenawi 2014; Römer – Bailey 2019. 143 Regarding these trends in the general region of North Africa: Hirschfeld 1997; Rubin 1998. 144 Conant 2022, 376–378. 145 Conant 2022, 383–386. 146 Morrison 2022, 415–418. 147 Fenwick 2022.",
              "Challenging the Significance of the LALIA and the Justinianic Plague 749 with the beginning of the LALIA and the Justinianic plague, an examination of this region’s archaeology will reveal whether these calamities had a significant impact on the Eastern Roman Empire. Although some surveys in North Africa show a decline in the number of sites in the 5th or 6th c. CE, this was attributed to a change in the fabric of the society before the LALIA and Justinianic plague or the reconquest conducted by the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire, with a movement from an extensive agricultural hin- terland to nucleated communities in urban centres. Yet in some cases, these conclu- sions may be derived from problems in the dating of the ceramic assemblages.148 Nevertheless, under Eastern Roman/Byzantine control, when the LALIA and Jus- tinianic plagues reportedly plagued the Empire, there was no general decline in population size in the region. Even those attempting to downplay the significance of the Islamic Conquest in the deterioration of societal structures in North Africa are forced to admit that according to the archaeological record, the main decline occurred in the following century and a half after the Islamic Conquest, i.e. in the late 7th and throughout the 8th c. CE.149 The best way to examine this period, and overcome the problems of dating visible in older surveys, is to examine one of the latest surveys. The Thugga survey was conducted by the University of Trento (Italy) and the Institut National du Patrimoine of Tunisia, and an area of 660 km2 was surveyed in the Medjerda Valley in the Tunisian High Tell.150 In this survey, 643 anthropogenic features were detected and documented. There were 141 separate characteristics and locations dated between 31 BCE and 250 CE, and this number climbed to 153 sites between 250 CE and the Vandal conquest of 430 CE. The number of sites decreased to 147 during the Vandal period, which lasted from 430 to 533 CE. By contrast, the number of sites climbed to 176 during the rule of the Eastern Roman Empire (534–690 CE). However, after the Islamic conquest, the number of sites decreased, with only 21 sites and features attributed to the 8th–13th c. CE (Fig. 7a and b).151 148 For a detailed analysis of the different surveys, and an explanation of the results and why the dating of past surveys may have been biased, see: Fenwick 2013. 149 Fenwick 2022, 428–431. 150 De Vos Raaijmakers – Attoui 2013; De Vos Raaijmakers 2013. 151 De Vos Raaijmakers – Attoui 2013; De Vos Raaijmakers 2013.",

According to this survey, while an area was ruled by the Eastern Roman Empire and was not influenced by wars, invasions, raids, or brief conquests, the region thrived. When the LALIA and the Justinianic plague were the only supposedly apoc- alyptic occurrences that a region experienced, there was no decline, while in some places there was a peak, suggesting that they were not nearly as devastating in that region. Since the Justinianic plague’s outcome is death, and its consequences could never be described as positive and conducive to population growth, the LALIA with its small fall in temperature could be considered beneficial, similar to what Bruins suggested,152 as it possibly encouraged and supported the prosperity under Eastern Roman rule.

Conclusion As demonstrated in this article, the utilisation of micro- and macro-scale data allows us to gain a better understanding of the general status of the Late Eastern Roman Empire in the 5th and 6th centuries. The combination of these two types of data has been employed not only to supplement, but also to better understand the demo- graphic and economic transformations that occurred in the Eastern Mediterranean between the 5th and 7th c.

These previous assertions for such a fall were inaccurate and based on incorrect dating, meaning that the decline should be dated to the 7th c. CE. The fact that the decrease occurred in the 7th c. CE entirely excludes at least one of the suggested causes of the decline, the LALIA, as this short-term climate shift with its repeatedly questioned effects happened mainly in the mid-6th c. CE. Additionally, research undertaken in Judaea/Palaestina clearly reveals that there was no significant temperature shift during the mid-6th c. CE. The seventy or more years between the LALIA and the settlement drop show that this short-term change in climate played no role in the decline. The other alleged ‘culprit,’ the Justinianic plague, is similarly unrelated to this fall. From the mid-6th to the beginning of the 8th c. CE, the Justinianic epidemic is said to have lasted 200 years. The fundamental issue with this pandemic is that most experts agree on its size and chronology with considerable accuracy in the mid-6th c. CE. However, there is considerable controversy about its impact, mor- bidity, and duration, with a substantial lack of mass graves ascribed to the time, fuelling this debate. Furthermore, the consequences and breadth of the disease in the regions of the Eastern Roman Empire are still being debated. Nevertheless, given that the decline was a long process that only started in the 7th c. CE, it can be concluded that it was most likely caused by anthropogenic actions in the form of geopolitical, social, and economic changes brought about by wars between the Late Eastern Roman Empire on the one hand, and the Persians, and later the Arabs, on the other. This is especially true since after the first occurrences of the pandemic in the mid-6th c. CE, the Eastern part of the Mediterranean basin expe- rienced a peak in population and number of sites, suggesting that the Justinianic 153 Castiglia – Pergola 2023, 137, 151–152.",
              "752 Haggai Olshanetsky – Lev Cosijns plague was not severe and possibly inconsequential in the long term. Further- more, some of the finds from certain areas in Turkey and North Africa imply that there was higher precipitation in certain areas, which may have assisted in set- tlement and population expansion, and contributed to the peak in population at the end of the 6th century CE. Therefore, it is possible that the climate change in those sub-regions may have counter-balanced the higher mortality rates during the Justinianic plague. As there was no change in the climate in the mid-7th c. CE and the pandemic occurrences became more sporadic and milder, the reason for the deterioration of the area most probably was the constant state of war and the deterioration of trade and central organization. This decline, which was encouraged by bouts of conflict, continued into the 8th c. CE.

Since this session is planned in a congress of Byzantine studies, its perspective is overtly ‘imperial’ (in the sense of the Byzantine empire) and implies an insider view of Byzantium’s neighbours. Viewing the Sasanians or the Arab and Persian Muslims from the perspective of Greek, Syriac or Armeni- an texts and not Parthian, Middle Persian, Sogdian or Arabic shows how Byzantium is placed at the centre of the circle of neighbouring countries and cultures. Because of a relative dearth of written sourc- es in Middle Persian, the history of Sasanian Iran, just as that of the Achaemenid period, is still largely seen through ‘western’ eyes and ‘western’ sources written in Latin, Greek, and Syriac.2 Inviting a specialist of Syriac texts, however, allows for a slightly de-centred viewpoint, having recourse to peripheral texts produced in the eastern empire and east of the empire, in the Sasanian and Is- lamic periods. Syriac texts offer an insider/outsider view of Byzan- tium, not only from a geopolitical point of view but also from a geo- ecclesial perspective. They are generally considered by Byzantinists as representative of ‘eastern Christianity’ (eastern ‘Christianities’/ christianismes orientaux, in the plural, would be more appropriate) and not as Byzantine texts proper, although they were produced in the third cultural language of the empire in terms both of the size of its literature and its unique presence in the first Church coun- cils, whereas Latin and Greek were the only official languages of the Church (Millar 2006). This is primarily due to the hierarchic posi- tion of Greek and Latin as the official languages of the Roman “cos- mopolis” (on this notion see Pollock 2006) and as hiéroglossies, the official and hence dominant languages of imperial Christianity (De- bié forthcoming a). Syriac – as well as Coptic, Arabic, Armenian, and Georgian – , is not either an idiom of ancient or ‘classical’ culture as it is defined in the West, whose only languages are Latin and Greek, although the cultures expressed in these languages took over and acculturated to a large extent the ancient Hellenic paideia. Syriac’s marginal position is also related to the fact that Orthodoxy over time became more and more equated with Greek and Byzantium, although Roman, with Hellenism (Dagron 1994; Cameron 2014). Since those who refused the conclusions of the ecumenical councils of Ephesus (431) and Chalcedon (451) in Syria and Mesopotamia increasingly used Syriac (Coptic, or Armenian) as their ecclesiastical and cultur- 1 I am grateful to Emiliano Fiori for his reading and suggestions.

They are still viewed in modern scholarship as Oriental Orthodox, through the lens of con- fessional affiliations and as outsiders in terms of Byzantine Ortho- doxy. From the perspective of Byzantinists, Syriac texts are already in many ways ‘eastern’, while they are produced inside the Empire. In a sense, they tend to be considered as ‘neighbouring’ productions within the Roman Empire, as peripheral to the main cultural, reli- gious and linguistic streams. They are all the more so when they were written beyond the Byzantine polity, in the Sasanid empire and even further in Central Asia or China or when they originated from Arabia. Syriac texts are instrumental as sources for Sasanian history, since they provide information from inside the Empire, while we have few Middle Persian texts. Just as in the Byzantine Empire, howev- er, they were somehow peripheral, since they were prominently pro- duced in former Aramaic-speaking areas in the western part of the Empire, by a religious minority within the Zoroastrian official reli- gion.3 Since they were written in both empires, they occupy nonethe- less a central position for understanding the relations between them and attest two-way exchanges. The Southern neighbours of Byzantium were not included in the programme of this session, although the Arabian Peninsula was part of the geopolitical and geo-religious relations between Byzantium, Axum and the Sasanian Empire in Late Antiquity (Bowersock 2017). Syriac sources offer an insider view of the exchanges of the Roman Empire with Persia and Arabia (in the sense of Southern Arabia, not only the Roman province of Arabia) since some of them were writ- ten or circulated in the Arabian Peninsula. They can thus provide a broader view of Byzantium’s neighbouring worlds. Ethiopia and Nubia should also be considered in that network of civilisations and empires. 2 Eastern Transfers After the belligerent state of the Romano-Sasanian relations in the third century, more consensual relations developed in the following centuries in spite of recurrent wars (Dignas, Winter 2007; Great- rex, Lieu 2002), and a common verbal and iconographic language was used in the two courts to present the king in an increasingly sa- 3 They have thus been often considered as ‘tertiary’ by specialists of Iranian studies after Gignoux’s classification, which separated Sasanian sources, considered as pri- mary, from the Roman ones, treated as tertiary (Gignoux 1978).

The two hostile systems of sa- cred universal sovereignty nevertheless implied cross-cultural rela- tions. The artistic, ritual, and ideological interactions between the late Roman and Persian Empire were accompanied by textual pro- ductions and exchanges in spite of – or perhaps because of – their constant rivalry. Letters were exchanged between sovereigns, like the famous letter sent by Constantine to Shapur II about the Christians in Iran (Smith 2016). Peace treaties entailed negotiations and exchanges through translations and written accounts in both Greek and Middle Persian that were also probably sent to the Arab clients of each empire, who were involved in the discussions, since their situation was discussed in the treaties’ clauses. Official letters and documents circulated be- tween Constantinople and Ctesiphon and among the Arab, Hunnic and Turkish clients or enemies of both empires.

A written multilin- gual culture was weaved through these official interactions beyond the borders of each empire. Bureaux of the barbarians in both em- pires gathered information, provided interpreters, and managed the sometimes troublesome allies. Exchanges existed at an administra- tive level and produced texts that are seldom considered as literary production. They were, however, a crucial part of the interactions be- tween the various late antique polities at a political level. If we focus on texts, translations are the most obvious way of fol- lowing their transmission.4 They exemplify how Hellenic culture cir- culated in languages other than Greek and outside of the Roman/ Byzantine Empire (Debié 2017), and how in turn it was permeated by external texts. Circulation of people was an important means for the transmission of ideas and texts. Ambassadors sent from one court to another were agents of intellectual and literary transfers. They were chosen among the high-ranking officials of each empire in order to negotiate peace, but scholars were also sent for discussions. Byzan- tine physicians were especially popular for these missions since they could cure the Persian kings, their family or their courtiers, and thus gain their trust and have direct access to their person. Conversely, bishops were often sent by the shah to the Christian emperor with the same goal of winning his trust and finding a familiar ground for conversation more easily. Encounters and dialogues held at court, in the presence of the king in Constantinople and in Ctesiphon, wheth- er on philosophical, scientific or religious matters, were privileged occasions of direct contact and intellectual exchanges in spite of the linguistic obstacles and cultural differences. In addition to discus- sions about military and economic questions over peace treaties, both empires deployed a diplomacy based on science, philosophy, and re- 4 For exchanges in terms of material culture and artistic productions, see Canepa 2009.

A long-term process of cultural transfer and amalgamation took place in the Sasanian period, during which Iran was a crossroad of knowledge coming from east and west in the various languages in use in the empire (Dignas, Winter 2007; Zakeri 2022). Late antique Iran hosted “Roman philosophers, Indian sages, and Jewish and Chris- tian religious leaders from within and outside the empire” (Zakeri 2022, 55) who contributed to a cosmopolitan and connected culture well before the Abbasid period and its translation movement (Debié 2014). Yet Sasanian Iran is still little included in studies dealing with Late Antiquity although, in principle, its importance has long been acknowledged (Walker 2002). The links of Byzantium with Central Asia and India are even less considered. 2.1 From Byzantium to Ērānšahr and Back. Medicine and Philosophy The history of sciences in Zoroastrian sources (which are preserved in written form dating to the Islamic period) relies on the construct- ed memory of a major divide between the Greek west and Iran pro- voked by Alexander the Great’s invasion of Persia, which led to the nearly total destruction and dispersal of all sacred and profane Ira- nian wisdom and religious texts (although the Avesta was in fact transmitted orally until the Sasanian period).5 The loss would be re- paired under the Parthians and more actively by the Sasanians, es- pecially by Ḵosrow I Anuširvān (r. 531-79), who reclaimed the trac- es of knowledge from all quarters of the world (Shaki 1981; Zakeri 2022, 58). The religious text of the Avesta and scientific knowledge shared the same fate of dispersion after the Greek conquest and de- struction and were associated in progressive restoration according to the Zoroastrian tradition (Dēnkard, ninth century). The image of the ‘Greeks’ is thus marred by the layer of Hellenistic memory, al- though Greek became the lingua franca used in western Asia along- side Aramaic under Alexander and the Seleucids, until at least the first century CE. In the Sasanian period, Greek and Indian texts on 5 Alexander was viewed in a very negative light in the Sasanian period, which is why it is very improbable, from a historical point of view, that the Alexander Romance was translated from Greek into Middle Persian (and then into Syriac) as has long been stat- ed and is still defended by some (Van Bladel 2007). Other linguistic arguments point in the same direction (Ciancaglini 2015). The consensus now is that it was translated di- rectly from Greek into Syriac, without a Middle Persian intermediary of which there is no trace (Debié forthcoming b).

              "Muriel Debié Textual Exchanges in Late Antiquity astrology and astronomy, physics, medicine, and mathematics were translated into Middle Persian starting with the reign of Ardashir I (r. 211/212-224), the founder of the Sasanian dynasty, and his son Shapur I (r. 240-70), and then under Ḵosrow I (Zakeri 2022, 68-70). In Roman imagination, conversely, Persia was the place where Chaldean magic and astrology originated. It was also the gateway to India and the wisdom of the Brahmins and had a special appeal to philosophers. Physicians played an important role in the transmission of knowl- edge and in the diplomatic relationships between the Roman and Sasanian empires. The first attestation of Greek physicians settling in the Sasanian Empire date to the third century, purportedly fol- lowing the marriage of the daughter of the Roman emperor Aurelian (r. 270-275) with the Sasanian king. Hippocratic medicine was thus taught in Iran at least since that time and the city of Gondešapur may have become since then a centre for medical practice and study, al- though it is attested mostly in the ninth century when East-Syriac physicians educated in the local school flourished (Debié 2014). Shapur’s head physician was a Persian Christian named Theodore, who wrote a compendium of medicine, according to Ibn al-Nadīm (Kitāb al-Fihrist [ed. Flügel 1872, 303.16-18]). This is only the first example of a long line of very influential Christian physicians at the Sasanian court (Debié 2014, 33-5). Around 532, another physician, Uranius, a Syrian, was sent as an ambassador to the Persian court and made a great impression with his knowledge of philosophy (Blockley 1980). When he came back to Constantinople, he was invited to dinner by the civic elites so that he could read passages of the letters he had received from Ḵosrow – who purportedly presented himself as Uranius’ disciple – and narrate his encounters with the shah (Agathias, Histories II.29-30.2 [ed. Keydell 1967, 78-9; transl. Frendo 1975, 63-4]; Walker 2002, 67). The cour- tiers of Byzantium were obviously curious and eager to hear about the Sasanian court and king. In 544, Stephen, a physician from Edessa, was chosen by the in- habitants of the city to negotiate with Ḵosrow who was besieging the city, because he had sojourned at the Persian court and cured Kawad, the previous king (d. 531). Several other physicians are mentioned in Ḵosrow’s entourage: Tribunus, also an envoy of Justinian, was a Byz- antine archiatros, head physician, as well as one Sergius. East-Syriac physicians were also influential at his court: Birway, Qišway (who gave to Abraham d-Bet Rabban the piece of land where he constructed the hospital of the East-Syriac school of Nisibis), Gabriel of Šiggar, and Joseph, who was also the catholicos of the Church of the East and enjoyed parrhesia/freedom of speech with the king according to the sources. Soon after 574, the physician Zachariah was sent four times as an ambassador of Justin II to the Sasanian king (Debié 2014, 35).

              "Muriel Debié Textual Exchanges in Late Antiquity Trained as physicians, these learned men also studied philoso- phy – and theology. They belonged to the elites of the two empires and ensured the relations of both courts at the highest level. They were also likely the instruments of transmission of philosophical and medical knowledge between empires, and, more marginally, of belles lettres (see below). In 489, when the School of the Persians in Edessa was closed be- cause of its Dyophysite teaching, the students and professors settled in Nisibis, which became one of the most famous schools of the Per- sian Empire where Greek texts of theology, law and medicine were read, translated into Syriac and commented (Becker 2006; 2008). Maʿna of Shiraz, who studied at the School of the Persians in Edes- sa and was elected metropolite of Rew Ardashir c. 480, translated from Greek into Syriac the works of Diodore of Tarsus and Theodore of Mopsuestia, which became the theological and scholastic basis of teaching in the Church of the East. Philosophy and medicine were closely linked and were both taught at the School, with theology as the crowning subject of the curriculum for clerics. As in Byzantium, the trivium or quadrivium remained the normal curriculum of study in the East-Syrian schools. It included geometry, mathematics, as- tronomy, and meteorology. Sergius of Rēšʿaynā (a city located in Northern Mesopotamia; d. 536) who had studied medicine in Alexandria and was a priest as well as an archiatros, was the first to translate Greek philosophical and medical texts into Syriac and write commentaries on Aristotle’s Or- ganon (Brock 2011c). He also composed two works of his own, On the Influence of the Moon and The Movement on the Sun. His translations formed the basis of translations from Syriac into Arabic at the Ab- basid period, thus disseminating Greek culture over time and across languages and religions. Sergius occupied a prominent position in the Byzantine Empire: in 535, Ephrem, the Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch (526/8-545) entrusted him with letters for the Pope and sent him to Rome. He was among those who escorted to Constantinople Pope Agapetus I who travelled in a mission to Justinian at the behest of King Theodahad of the Ostrogoths. He was thus part of ecclesias- tical diplomacy at the highest level and is exemplary of the links be- tween Rome and Antioch on the one hand, Italy and Constantinople on the other. We cannot but wonder if his geo-ecclesial embassy al- so implied the circulation of texts from the eastern Roman Empire to the West. His career ended there since he died in Constantinople the following year. It is noticeable that he had also personal links east of Byzantium, in Iran. He addressed his commentary on the Catego- ries, as well as several of his translations of Galenic medical texts, to one Theodore, bishop of Karḫ Ǧuddān, a town located on the Riv- er Diyālā in Iran. He thus had connections from one end to the other of the Roman Empire, between Constantinople and Rome, as well as The 24th International Congress of Byzantine Studies 1 | 1 265 Proceedings of the Plenary Sessions, 259-280",

His case exemplifies the circulation of texts be- yond the political borders of empires and the high status a physician aka philosopher held at the Byzantine court. Fascination for Persia and India probably partly explains why phi- losophers repeatedly went to the Iranian court. In 242 CE the philoso- pher Plotinus accompanied the army of Emperor Gordian III (238-44) when he invaded the Sasanian territory. It seems that he was try- ing to get to India and wanted to meet with philosophers of both em- pires. In 337, the philosopher Metrodorus went from the eastern Ro- man Empire to India via Iran. It is likely that he stopped at the Persian court since Emperor Constantine I (306-37) threatened the Sasani- an shah with war if Metrodorus’ goods that were stolen on his way back were not returned. Eustathius, a noble Roman and a pupil of the philosopher Iamblichus, was sent in 358 to Shapur II as an ambas- sador of Constantius II (r. 337-61). According to Ammianus Marcelli- nus and Eunapius, he impressed the shah to the point that the latter was almost ready to adopt the philosopher’s cloak (Zakeri 2022, 70). Conversely, we know that at the court of king Ḵosrow I, Paul the Persian, an East-Syriac theologian and philosopher, wrote a short commentary on Aristotle’s De interpretatione (Bennett 2003). Aris- totelian philosophy was taught in East Syriac schools in Syriac, and probably partly in Greek. But this text was written in Middle Per- sian and translated from Middle Persian into Syriac by the already mentioned Severus Sebokht (d. 666-667), who was of Iranian origin and himself taught Aristotelian philosophy and astronomy. It is still extant in Syriac. It was also translated into Arabic later on. Paul al- so produced a text exposing Aristotelian logic for the Sasanian king, the Treatise on the Logic of Aristotle the Philosopher Addressed to King Ḵosrow (Bennett 2003). It was also likely written in Middle Per- sian since it was intended for the king who, as far we know, did not know Greek. Through this example, we witness the double movement of Greek philosophy making its way into the Persian court by way of a Middle Persian commentary dependent upon Porphyry’s Isagoge, written by a scholar who was a member of the Church of the East. This particular treatise made its way back to Syria thanks to the translation into Syriac made by Severus, a scholar active in the mon- astery of Qenneshre on the Euphrates, which was famous for its lin- eage of monks, patriarchs and bishops who were also scientists and philosophers (Jacob of Edessa and George of the Arabs in particu- lar). The fate of this text exemplifies the circulation of texts across the borders from east of Byzantium.

              "Muriel Debié Textual Exchanges in Late Antiquity 2.2 The Two Eyes of the Earth in the Sixth Century. Justinian and Ḵosrow We have no other detailed account of a Roman-Sasanian peace trea- ty like the one of 561 CE recorded by Menander Protector (Blockley 1985). It emphasises the degree of interactions and exchanges be- tween the Two Eyes of the Earth. This cosmic expression that desig- nates the Roman and the Sasanian empires is used in Theophylact Simocatta’s history, in a letter addressed by Ḵosrow II to the emper- or Maurice (Canepa 2009, 1), but can be applied as well to earlier periods, in particular to the powerful kings Justinian and Ḵosrow. Ḵosrow’s reign marks an acme in the interest in philosophical and scientific texts at the Sasanian court. The Persian king had texts of astronomy and medicine translated from Greek, Sanskrit, and Syr- iac into Middle Persian, making his court a crossroad open to sci- ences coming from east and west. He was also interested in texts of other religious traditions. John of Ephesus (c. 507-c. 586), a histori- an in the service of Justinian who wrote in Syriac, reports that the king was keen on reading the religious books of all creeds, as well as philosophy. It is well known that in 529, when Justinian closed the Neoplaton- ic school in Athens, seven philosophers reputedly took refuge at the court of Ḵosrow I who was interested in philosophy and sciences and was hailed by them as Plato’s Philosopher King.6 The reason for their exile, according to the historian Agathias (Histories II.30.3-31.9 [ed. Keydell 1967, 80-1]), was that: They were forbidden by law to take part in public life with impu- nity owing to the fact that they did not conform to the established religion. (transl. Frendo 1975, 65) These Hellenic (non-Christian) philosophers, however, went back to the Roman Empire when peace was signed between the two empires in 532, apparently disappointed by the king’s erudition and the cor- ruption of the Persian court (a Greek topos) if we follow what Agathi- as says. In the peace treaty of 532-533, Ḵosrow made sure to stipulate that the philosophers would be allowed to return to their homeland. They were permitted to keep their belief but not to teach it, in order to conform to Justinian’s regulations. The Persian king thus appears as the protector of the non-Christian philosophers in the Byzantine Empire through the peace treaty negotiations just as Constantine had 6 There is a large bibliography on the subject, with sceptic or positive views of the re- ality of the philosophers’ travel. See in particular Watts 2004; 2011; Beaucamp 2002; Hartmann 2002; Walker 2002; Tardieu 1994; Marcotte 2014; 2015; Dan 2017.

              "Muriel Debié Textual Exchanges in Late Antiquity posed as the protector of Christians in the Sasanian Empire. Accord- ing to Agathias, Ḵosrow verified adherence to the stipulations (Ag- athias, 2.31.2-4; Kettenhofen 2009). We have a unique trace of their participation in a discussion at the Sasanian court in presence of Ḵosrow in the form of a short treatise that one of them, Priscian of Lydia, addressed to the Persian king. It has not survived in Greek – neither in Middle Persian – but a Latin translation made in the Carolingian period, maybe in the entourage of John Scotus Eriugena (c. 800-c. 877), is preserved under the title Solutiones eorum quibus dubitavit Chosroes Persarum rex. It consists in ten chapters, each providing answers to a question asked by the king about meteorology (as Aristotle envisioned it) and physics. Rath- er than a mere collection of random subjects, it was an introduction to Aristotle for the Platonic king (Tardieu 2015). It started with the soul’s nature, went on with medicine, the body as the place of the soul and ended with the cosmos as the place of the body. In the proemi- um, Priscian gives an ideal list of sources, of which only a few are ac- tually cited in the work, likely from collections of extracts (Marcotte 2014; 2015). Ḵosrow, according to Agathias, knew the Timaeus and Phaedo and other Platonic dialogues. Priscian cited them in the first place, then passing to Plotinus and Proclus, the Neoplatonic teach- er, through Aristotle, Theophrastus, and Poseidonius’s and Arrian’s meteorology, following the late antique Neoplatonic curriculum as it was transmitted in scholarly text-books of ἐκλογαί, extracts, or in the teachers’ ὑπομνήματα, notes (Dan 2017, 574). 2.3 Geography and Astronomy Interest in the eastern empire and the routes to Iran and India is manifest in Byzantium in the sixth century. The Chrestomathies (χρηστομάθεια, ‘useful knowledge’) of Strabo were recomposed in the sixth century in the region of Osrhoene (or northern Syria), as we can infer from the central position it occupies in the reorganisation of the matter. To Strabo’s geography were added citations of Xeno- phon, Arrian and Ptolemy. The recension ‘E’ of the Chrestomathies was also associated in the Paris manuscript with Isidore of Charax’ Parthian Stations, Σταθμοὶ Παρθικοί, an itinerary from Antioch to In- dia commissioned by the emperor Augustus (Marcotte 2014; 2015). The special interest shown in the text – and in this particular manu- script – for the region of Osrhoene and the itineraries to Persia and India coincides with the reconstruction of strongholds in the region by Justinian. Geography was an important form of practical knowl- edge for both empires in the context of the Roman-Persian wars. A similar version of the Chrestomathies was also cited by Priscian in his Solutiones, reflecting Neoplatonic adaptations made in north- The 24th International Congress of Byzantine Studies 1 | 1 268 Proceedings of the Plenary Sessions, 259-280",
              "Muriel Debié Textual Exchanges in Late Antiquity ern Syria or Osrhoene. His choice of topics like naphtha or biting snakes may reflect an adaptation to local interests at the Sasani- an court. He may have in turn observed or found in Iran a detailed description of the evolution of rabies per regionem persarum (Dan 2017, 585). He introduced Greek geography in Iran, whereas Zoro- astrian cosmology and sacred history were the guiding knowledge and principles for the Sasanian kings and their court (Shapira 2001; Payne 2013). Astronomy was another important field of interest in Late Antiq- uity, although astrology as such was condemned by the Church. As- trologers, like physicians, had direct access to the Persian kings and as such also played an important role at the court since they were in charge of establishing military horoscopes and personal horoscopes of important people (Panaino 2017). In the Byzantine Empire, too, and in spite of the condemnation of astral determinism, astrology was part of the everyday life of the population and was influential at the Byzantine court (Magdalino 2006). Iatromathematics was of special importance and the presence of both physicians and astrologers at the Sasanian court enhanced the complementary character of these fields, where theory and practice were implemented and confronted in schools, hospitals, and in the entourage of the shah (Delaini 2014). We know that Kawād had a personal Christian astrologer named Mu- sa (or Maswi) who used his influence for the election of one of his relatives as catholicos of the Church of the East, in which the king had a say (Panaino 2017, 151). Ḵosrow II Parwēz (590-628) was also influenced for the election of the catholicos Gregory by a Christian astrologer, philosopher and physician who was also an archdeacon, named Aba of Kaškar (Panaino 2017, 152-3). His high position at the court is confirmed by the fact that Ḵosrow sent him as an ambassa- dor to the emperor Maurice (Sako 1986), following the tradition of sending high clerics who were also renowned scholars to the neigh- bouring and rival empire. The circulation of these ambassadors of knowledge probably fostered the cross-cultural circulation of texts and ideas between empires. We have an interesting report of such circulation in the context of applied sciences at the Sasanian court. As with medicine, the prac- tical aspects of astronomy were the main reason for the emperors’ interest and their sponsoring of scholarly activities. In 556, in the twenty-fifth year of his reign, Ḵosrow I convened a conference of as- tronomers in order to update the royal astronomical tables and had an Indian text compared with Ptolemy’s Syntaxis. These tables need- ed to be revised regularly in order to conform to the astronomical year and enable the calculation of political and personal horoscopes as well as set up the yearly calendar. It was the occasion of a con- frontation of mathematical calculations based on various traditions coming from east and west. This circulation from India to the Sasan- The 24th International Congress of Byzantine Studies 1 | 1 269 Proceedings of the Plenary Sessions, 259-280",
              "Muriel Debié Textual Exchanges in Late Antiquity ian Empire might explain how the Syriac scholar Severus Sebokht (d. 666/7) who was active in the monastery of Qenneshre on the Eu- phrates and wrote a Treatise on the Astrolabe and a Treatise on the Constellations heard about Indian numbers (Villey 2014; Debié 2014). In the sixth-eighth centuries, astronomical knowledge circulated from China and India through Persia to the Jazira and Byzantium. Émilie Villey recently found evidence of Chinese vocabulary and clas- sification of comets in Syriac texts. The Syriac Book of Medicine, in a passage that might be dated before 550 and was composed in Huz- istan, seems to have preserved Sanskrit terms whereas Chinese in- fluence is attested in Jacob of Edessa’s Hexaemeron (before 708) and later Syriac-Orthodox texts (Villey 2021). This material from Chinese astronomy can be explained by the presence of Syriac-Orthodox, since at least the beginning of the seventh century, in Ḥerat, in Kho- rasan (ancient Bactria or Tokharistan, modern Afghanistan), which became a bishopric and an ecclesiastical metropolis. Since 648, the region was under the control of the Tang dynasty, which facilitated the circulation from and to the Chinese capital Chang’an and the im- plantation of Chinese officials, including astronomers in charge of the observation of the sky for the establishment of the calendar and of horoscopes. We know also from Chinese sources that embassies reached Byzantium in the seventh and eighth centuries, enabling cross-cultural artistic exchanges (Walker 2003). The other way around, astronomers/astrologers who were mem- bers of the Church of the East disseminated western astronomical sci- ence all the way to the court of the Tangs. The discovery in the 1980s of a funerary tombstone confirmed that a Christian astrologer of Ira- nian origin named Li Su (743-817), also known as Wenzhen, was also one and the same as the Luqa mentioned on the famous Chinese-Syr- iac stele of Xi’an (781), who likely was a cleric of the Church of the East. He was sent to the Chinese court in Chang’an between 766 and 779, where he became the director of the bureau of astronomy (Pa- naino 2017). He supplanted an Indian dynasty of astronomers, just as Chinese vocabulary and classification of comets seem to have over- taken Indian knowledge in Syriac texts. From the little information we have in Syriac, a shift of influence from Indian to Chinese astrono- my seems to have taken place at the beginning of the eighth century. Closer to Byzantium, Severus Sebokht sent one of his disciples to teach Stephanos, illustris and chartularius of the Jazira, how to use Ptolemy’s astronomical tables. The practice of astronomy went on based on the Greek tradition. In the eighth century, the famous The- ophilus of Edessa (Debié 2015; 2016), a Maronite astrologer at the court of the Abbasid caliphs, wrote astronomical treatises in Greek. These treatises attest that he knew Indian and Iranian astronomy. They were later cited by Arab scholars on the one hand and reached Constantinople c. 775 on the other, through the intermediary of Pseu- The 24th International Congress of Byzantine Studies 1 | 1 270 Proceedings of the Plenary Sessions, 259-280",

Pseudo-Stephen al- so wrote treatises in Greek in Baghdad that were then translated in- to Arabic (Tihon 1993; Magdalino 1998). 2.4 Literary Texts from the East to the West and Back Religious and, interestingly, profane literature circulated with these high clerics who were also scholars. The famous Aba I, the future ca- tholicos of the Church of the East (d. 552), who was educated in Mid- dle Persian belles lettres, learned Syriac in Nisibis and Greek in Edes- sa. He visited with his teacher of Greek, Thomas, Alexandria, Egypt, Athens, Corinth, Constantinople, and Antioch before coming back to Nisibis and Ctesiphon. He is mentioned under the name of Patrikios by Cosmas Indicopleustes as his teacher for biblical studies. Trans- lations from Greek into Syriac made Christian authors known in the Sasanian Empire. A literary text enjoyed a tremendous success in the Middle East and then in the West, where it was translated into many languages. The collection of fables called Kalila and Dimna from the name of the two protagonists, two jackals, in which the actors are animals, treat- ed political questions and was translated from the now lost Sanskrit Pañcatantra and other Indian collections of tales and fables into Mid- dle Persian (Brock 2011a). The translation of tales from these col- lections was made in the 570s by Burzoy (Barzaway), who was also a physician at the court of Ḵosrow I and was sent to India by the king, as is stated in his ‘autobiography’ that precedes the Arabic transla- tion by Ibn al-Muqaffaʿ. His translation does not survive but it was in turn translated into Syriac by Bodh, a periodeutes (ecclesiastical visitor) of the Church of the East, and is still extant. A later trans- lation from Middle Persian into Arabic was made in the first half of the eighth century, by the Persian scholar Ibn al-Muqaffaʿ. This does not survive either but formed the basis for all the subsequent trans- lations into Arabic, Persian, Greek, Hebrew and Old Spanish. It was also translated into Syriac in the tenth or eleventh century in an ex- panded version, compared to the first one, including the narrative of Burzoy, which the first translation did not include. A second transla- tion from Arabic into Syriac was made in the nineteenth century by Thomas Audo. Under the title of the Fables of Bidpay, or Pilpay, this small collection was translated into Turkish and into western lan- guages: John of Ca pua translated it into Latin in 1270. The French version (Le Livre des lumières ou la Conduite des rois, 1644) inspired Jean de La Fontaine for his own fables. It is also known in transla- tions in Thailand, Laos and Indonesia. It reached Byzantium only in the eleventh century, when a Greek translation was made in 1080 by the Jewish scholar Simeon Seth, under the title Stephanites and Ich- The 24th International Congress of Byzantine Studies 1 | 1 271 Proceedings of the Plenary Sessions, 259-280",

Although the first Syriac translation that made the stories known in the Middle East dates to the sixth century, it did not circulate in Byzantium and was known only later on from the Arabic version. The retranslation into Syriac from Arabic confirms the little success met by the first one. Although both were made in Iran, only the second one reached Byzantium via a Greek intermediary. A similar text of ‘oriental’ tales, Sindbad/Sintypas the sage (not to be confused with the even better-known Sindbad the sailor), was translated from a Persian or Indian original dating to the late Sasani- an period from Middle Persian into Arabic in the ninth century (Brock 2011d). It enjoyed great popularity and was also translated into He- brew and hence into Spanish and other European languages where it was known under the title of The Seven Sages of Rome. It was trans- lated early on from Arabic into Syriac. In the eleventh century, Mi- chael Andreopoulos translated it from Syriac into Greek in Melitene, a city of contacts between the Syrian-Orthodox and Greek Orthodox after the Byzantine reconquest. He gave Sindbad the name of Synti- pas under which it is generally known today. Another fictional text, the History of Alexander the Great, probably composed in the sixth century,7 stages a war between Alexander, re- imagined as a pious monotheistic king, and a fictitious Persian king named Tubarlaq. Alexander receives a revelation from an otherworld- ly being and triumphs over the Persian king. He also builds an im- pregnable door that reminds the reader of the formidable Sasanian walls reconstructed in the sixth century against the Huns. In two of these texts, the Huns are equated with the eschatological people of Gog and Magog. These apocalypses function as additional and inde- pendent Christianised episodes of the so-called Alexander Romance known in countless languages and cultures – including Syriac. They are a literary means to come to terms with the Roman-Persian wars and the related eschatological anxieties, and to reclaim for a ‘Greek’ king the exploit of keeping at bay both the Persians and the barbar- ians from the north. The anonymous author who composed the core of the History of Alexander weaved a story on what he heard about the military and political situation of his time on the borders between empires. We can find strong echoes of the History of the Exploits, that is a development of this first version, in surah 18 of the Qurʾān.

              "Muriel Debié Textual Exchanges in Late Antiquity veyed on the shared (and often conflictual) history of the Roman and Sasanian empires, and read as a comforting as well as entertaining literary composition intended for Syriac Christians living in the bor- derlands of both empires. Christians in both empires shared a common spirituality based on the cult of martyrs. Whereas persecutions ceased in the Roman Em- pire after the so-called edict of Milan, they went on in the Sasanian Empire, although in a more specific and less massive mode than in the third and fourth centuries. Numerous Acts of martyrs were writ- ten in Syriac (Brock 2008). The names of Persian martyrs reached the Roman Empire and became part of one of the most ancient lists of martyrs copied at the end of the earliest dated Syriac manuscript, written in Edessa in November 411 (Brock 2011a). This transmission of the martyrs’ names was accompanied by the translation of relics from the Persian Empire and the translation into Greek of some of these Acts (Brock 2011b). Marutha of Maypherqat is the driving force behind these movements. Trained as a physician before he became the bishop of Maypherqat (Greek Martyropolis, modern Silvan in Tur- key), he gained the favour of Yazdegerd I (399-420) and was sent to his court in 410 as a legate by Theodosius II. He obtained to convene a council for the Church of the East in Seleucia-Ctesiphon in 410. He reputedly translated into Syriac the canons of the ecumenical coun- cil of Nicaea and several documents linked to it. We know that he brought back with him the relics of Persian martyrs that owed his city the name of Martyropolis. He was probably also at the origin of the translation of Acts of the martyrs under Shapur II (309-79) that he had gathered while in Iran. Information about these martyrs also made their way into the Ecclesiastical History of Sozomen. Due to massive deportations of war prisoners from the Roman Em- pire in the third and fourth centuries, Greek-speaking Christians and their hierarchy played an important role in the Church of the East un- til at least the fifth century. This might explain the translations and regular contacts on both sides of the border. The interest for Persian martyrs in the west did not end with the martyrs under Shapur. In the case of two Persian martyrs under Ḵosrow I (531-79) and Ḵosrow II (591-628), Shirin (BHG 1637) and Golindouch (BHG 700-702; CPG 7521), two noble women belonging to the royal family, only the Greek versions survive, the Syriac originals having been lost. In the seventh century the Acts of Anastasius the Persian were written in Greek in Palestine where he was deported before his death, during the Per- sian occupation of the Eastern provinces of the Roman Empire (Flu- sin 1992). These translations or compositions in Greek attest the in- terest for fellow Christians in the Sasanian empire and conveyed information about everyday life in the neighbouring realm as well as about the administrative and ecclesiastical (Zoroastrian) institutions.

              "Muriel Debié Textual Exchanges in Late Antiquity Polemics and controversies as well as political concerns sparked translations from and into several languages. Agatangełos’ Histo- ry of the Armenians was thus translated into Middle Persian at the Sasanian court in order to give proof to the shah of the ancient no- bility of the Armenians. The catholicos Aqāq purportedly translated an account of Christian beliefs into Middle Persian for the Sasani- an ruler Kawād, in order to help him understand Christianity. A de- bate between a delegation of six members of the Church of the East (including the future catholicos Īšōʿyahb I) led by Paul, bishop of Ni- sibis, and the emperor Justinian took place in 562 in Constantinople (Rigolio 2019, no. 58, 219-22). Recorded in writing, this dispute relied on citations of Biblical and Patristic excerpts. Paul wrote his own ac- count of the dispute that was addressed to Kashwai, one of Ḵosrow I’s physicians mentioned above. The Catalogue of Syriac writers com- piled by ʿAbdīšōʿ bar Brīkā of Nisibis (thirteenth century) mentions a Conversation with Caesar (Debate with Caesar, CPG 6897) that Paul of Nisibis had authored and that could be this report (now lost). Chris- tological debates were thus transmitted in both empires and mani- fest the implication of both sovereigns who were interested in keep- ing religious unity and peace in their realm between religions and between Christian confessions and churches. They applied theology to their political agenda. Interestingly an anonymous fictitious Conversation at the Sasani- an Court (Διήγησις or Ἐξήγησις τῶν πραχθέντων ἐν Περσίδι [De ges- tis in Perside], CPG 6968) was composed in the sixth century (Rigo- lio 2017, no. 59, 222-9). Four debates in presence of a Sasanian king called Arrhinatus opposed representatives of the main religions of Late Antiquity – Hellenic paganism, Christianity, Zoroastrianism, and Judaism – , who also bore fictitious names and competed through miracles. One of the main interests of this text are the passages in Pseudo-Persian, the language in which the debates supposedly took place. Set at the Sasanian court, it reports that extracts from the ec- clesiastical historian Philip of Side were read. It adds letters and the Legend of Aphroditianus, an apocryphal text on the Magi, that circu- lated independently. It also heavily relies on the Book of Daniel. The text is an imaginative rendition by a Byzantine author of the Sasani- an court as a place of confrontation and at the same time of conviven- cia between religions, where the judge, a high-ranking Sasanian of- ficial and philosopher, proffered a discourse of religious freedom. This dialogue romance was probably inspired to a Christian author in the Roman Empire who heard about the interreligious dialogues held at Justinian’s or at the two Ḵosrow’s courts (Guillaumont 1969- 70; 1970). It is indicative of the image a Christian of the Roman Em- pire had of the Sasanians’ practice of public dialogues. Scientific and philosophical texts circulated as is expected be- tween the Roman and Sasanian empires as well as more east and The 24th International Congress of Byzantine Studies 1 | 1 274 Proceedings of the Plenary Sessions, 259-280",

The political impact of religious dissents and violence actually meant that knowing better one’s adversaries and talking with them was in- strumental in order to maintain a balance between the official reli- gion of the empire and the other ones, in the variety of their internal movements. Whether from intellectual curiosity or more practical po- litical concerns, religious dialogues were also the occasion for the circulation of texts. 3 Southern Exchanges The new discoveries of the past decades in terms of Arabian epigra- phy have changed in depth our understanding of the history of the Peninsula before Islam and have in particular shown how integrat- ed it was, not only in the economic networks of Late Antiquity, but also in the geopolitical and geo-religious relations between Byzan- tium, the Sasanian, South Arabian and Ethiopian kingdoms (Hoyland 2001; Bowersock 2004; 2017; McDonald 2009; Fisher 2011; Robin 2014; Robin, al-Ghabbān, al-Saʿīd 2014; Genequand, Robin 2015). Al- though the map of Late Antiquity should fully integrate the region, not just as a grey zone of desert, but as a region with courts, build- ings and cities, economic as well as religious and political networks, the impact of these changes very slowly sinks in the historiography of the region and the history of religions. The history of Late Antique Judaism hardly considers Arabian Judaism and Christianity in Arabia is seldom part of the picture of ancient Christianity. Emperors in Byzantium were not only interested in securing al- liances with their Arab clients but also eager to have some weigh in Arabia. Justin I (518-27) sent to the Lakhmid king al-Mundhir at Ḥirta/al-Ḥīra (the capital of the Naṣrids in northwest Arabia) Abra- mios, a priest and diplomat, son of Euphrasius and father of Nonno- sos, who belonged to a family of diplomats. During the reign of Jus- tinian and the Roman-Persian war in 530, Sergius, a deacon known to the Arab king, travelled back and forth holding the letters of al- Mundhir. These clerics were sent as delegates for peace discussions and travelled with letters from both parties. Texts also circulated in and from the Arabian Peninsula in at- tempts to gain Arabs and Ḥimyarites to the miaphysite faith. Com- petition between the various Christian affiliations fostered reli- gious-diplomatic encounters: Severus of Antioch and Philoxenus of Mabbug sent letters to the phylarch and stratelates of Ḥirtha/al-Ḥira, on Christological and ecclesiastical issues, in the context of the com- petition with the dyophysites of the Church of the East. Discussions were held at the enemies Arab courts of Ḥira and Gabitha, spon- The 24th International Congress of Byzantine Studies 1 | 1 275 Proceedings of the Plenary Sessions, 259-280",

Envoys of the Byzan- tine emperor, members of the Church of the East, and the highest authorities of the miaphysite party were present. In 536, when Jus- tinian enacted laws against the Miaphysites, Ephrem, the patriarch of Antioch, tried to gain al-Ḥarith b. Jabala/Arethas to the Chalce- donian cause. In the 580s, the miaphysite patriarchs of Antioch and Alexandria participated in a discussion convened by the Jafnid phy- larch in Gabitha at his encampment, and aimed at bridging the gap between them. As in the Church councils, convocation letters were sent in Greek, extracts from dogmatic texts were produced by each party and discussed in these reunions, letters dispatched the results of the discussions. Echoes of these sophisticated theological discus- sions can be traced in the Qurʾān (Debié 2016). The hagiographic dossier of the so-called martyrs of Najran ex- emplify the circulation of various clerics – Greek Orthodox, Syriac Miaphysites, members of the Church of the East, miaphysite Ethio- pians and local Arabs and Ḥimyarites belonging to these Christian denominations – inside Arabia and between empires (Beaucamp, Bri- quel-Chatonnet, Robin 2011). Simeon of Beth Arsham, ‘the Persian debater’, who circulated in the Sasanian Empire in order to convert to Miaphysitism Christians of the Persian Empire, was also active in the Arabian Peninsula. He received at the court of Ḥirtha/al-Ḥira in 523 the news of the massacre of Christian in Najran by Dhū Nuwās, the Ḥimyarite king converted to Judaism. He wrote a letter that was brought to a monastery in northern Syria in order to make the news known in the Roman Empire. Acts of the martyrs were written in Greek, in Syriac (the Book of the Ḥimyarites) and in Ethiopic, and were translated into Arabic. Echoes of the massacre were also iden- tified in the Qurʾān. Texts were thus exchanged between Constantinople and the Ara- bian Peninsula, as they were also with the neighbouring kingdoms of Ethiopia and Persia. A literate culture existed in Arabia, which ex- plains how quickly written documents started to be written in Arabic shortly after Muḥammad (Debié forthcoming c). Byzantium engaged in geopolitical and religious dialogue with its eastern and southern neighbours through clerics who played also a role as ambassadors of knowledge and cultural delegates.

The roughly 1,000 kilometers of desert separating the tiny coastal belt of Tripolitania from the Cyrenaica marked a frontier line in between these zones. During the Punic Wars (264-146 BCE), the Latin term Africa appeared in Roman politics and literature, referring to the province established after 146 BCE. Africa Proconsularis roughly comprised the territory of present-day Tunisia, the northeast of Algeria, and the coast of western Libya (Tripolitania) along the Gulf of Sirte. Furthermore, the Roman organization west of the Proconsularis comprised Numidia and the Mauretanian provinces. The Arabs basically continued using these divisions. While the concept of the Maghreb (al-Maghrib al-Kabīr) embraced the Atlas Mountains and the coastal plains of modern Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya (continuing the ancient concept of separating Egypt from the western regions), Ifrīqiya referred to modern Tunisia and eastern Algeria as well as Tripolitania. Thus, Ifrīqiya basically comprised the territories of the former Roman province of Africa. 2 See now ed.

Of the Vandal, Byzantine and Arab conquests, the latter probably had the most far-reaching influence with the spread of Islam and the inte- gration of the region into the Arab world. In this collection, we would like to draw attention to what we believe are still desiderata for North African history and archaeology between AD 500 and 1000. The essays in this collection were originally presented at the conference Africa 500-1000. New Perspectives for historical and archaeological research, 14-16 November 2018 in Tübin- gen. This interdisciplinary collection adapts a longue durée perspective on main transitions and transformations, such as external and internal characteristics and connections of North Africa to the Mediterranean and trans-Saharan world. This introduction is intended to set the individual contributions of the volume in their respective broader historical and archae- ological frameworks. One focus of this publication is the period of transition from Byzantine Africa to early Islamic Ifrīqiya during the 7th and 8th centuries. Two recent conference pub- lications dealt exclusively with this period.4 As Jonathan P. Conant demonstrated, late Roman and earliest medieval written sources reflect two perspectives: theological and military conflicts, religious changes and confes- sional controversy left their mark from the late Roman period to the Islamic age. Apart from the major conquests, continuous uprisings and conflicts between the Vandals, Byzantines, Berber tribal coalitions, the provincial population, and Arab ghazis shaped late antique North Africa. Archaeological data appears vital for writing a satisfactory history of late Byzantine and Early Islamic North Africa.5 Recent research shows continuity concerning urban and so- cial life. Not every urban or rural site was simply abandoned. What we see is a complex and multilayered process of transition.6 The increasing need for security among urban and rural residents culminated in the construction of fortifications throughout North Africa beginning in the 6th century.7 In addition to the Byzantine fortresses and later the Arab ribāts, fortified farms and homesteads, as well as fortified settlements, which are summarized under the umbrella term qsur, were increasingly built in the hinterland. This process of fortification continued in some regions until the Arab period.8 Geographical Overview North of the African deserts, three areas (apart from Egypt with the Nile), had a regular sup- ply of water and therefore could support settled populations as well as produce enough crops, barley, oil, and other products for export: Cyrenaica, Tripolitania, and North-West Africa 4 One conference held at Dumbarton Oaks in 2012 had a specific historical approach.

Introduction north of the Atlas Mountains.9 Sallust and other authors provided the legend of the Philaeni brothers from Carthage, creating a border by literary means. According to Sallust, when Carthage and the Greek cities in the Pentapolis tried to agree on a border in Libya, two pairs of athletes set out from Carthage and Cyrene on the same day, each pair running towards the other city. When the runners met, the Carthaginian pair had covered more ground. Accused of cheating by the Greeks, the Carthaginians swore solemnly that they had followed all rules and eventually consented to be buried alive at the meeting point. This sacrifice was meant to underline their rightful claim. Thereafter, the territory between that spot and Carthage would become part of the Carthaginian domain. The border was marked by two pillars la- beled the “Altars of the Philaeni”, Φιλαίνων Βωμοί.10 The spot described by Sallust was approximately halfway between modern Ra’s Lanuf and El Agheila. In 1937, the Italian colonial government erected a modern Arae Philaenorum some 30 kilometers from this place at the Libyan Coastal Highway (Via Balbia) to commem- orate the Roman past of the new Libyan colony. In 1973, the revolutionary leader Muammar al Gaddafi, who considered the landmark a sign of the Italian domination of Libya, ordered the arch to be destroyed to stress the unity of modern Libya, which today again is separated into Western Tripolitania and Eastern Cyrenaica.11 The tiny coastal belt of Tripolitania is separated from Cyrenaica by about 1,000 kilome- ters of desert, but from its ancient centers Oea (Tripoli), Sabratha and Leptis Magna to the Gulf of Gabès, a traveler had to manage only 300 kilometers of waterless areas. A wide coast- al plain, the Gefara, stretches just west of Leptis to the mainland opposite Meninx (Djerba). The frontier at the Arae Philaenorum described above marks off the areas we will deal with, the large region of northwestern Africa that includes Tripolitania, the Roman provinces of Africa Proconsularis, and the two kingdoms Mauretaniae and Numidia. The Arab concept of the Maghreb (al-Maghrib al-Kabīr) embraces the Atlas Mountains and the coastal plains of modern Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya. The Atlas Moun- tain range comprises four general regions: the Middle Atlas, High Atlas and Anti-Atlas in modern-day Morocco; the Saharan Atlas in Algeria, marking the northern edge of the great desert; the Tell Atlas in Algeria and Tunisia; and finally, the ",

The 2,600 kilometers of watered plains that ran from the Atlantic Ocean to the Arae Philaenorum became one of the most important agricultural landscapes of the Roman Empire. Modern Morocco (Mauretania Tingitana with its capital Tingis/Tanger), northern Algeria (Mauretania Caesariensis with its capital Caesarea; later, under Septimius Severus, Numidia became a province of its own) and Tunisia (Africa Proconsularis) share a Roman past with parts of Europe and the Middle East.13 9 Polybius, Histories 3, 39, 2; 10, 40, 7, ed. and trans.

In these countries, as well as in France, 19th- and 20th-century political issues were often projected back into antiquity by scholars. Anticolonial circles asserted a low level of “Romanization” and advo- cated a strong local Berber identity. French as well as Italian intellectuals, however, tended to create a master narrative using the Roman past of North Africa to claim it as a part of ancient Europe. Both French and Italians in North Africa presented themselves as the direct and natural successors of the Romans.14 The “otherness” of North Africa (in terms of the Arabs and Berbers, with their Islamic culture and tribal and nomadic societies) was countered by the conscious association of the colonizer with the Roman presence. It was comforting for the French and Italian armies on campaign in the remote desert and mountain margins to find traces of the earlier penetration of the Roman legions into the same spaces.15 Roughly speaking, the Arab history of the regions was pictured as a decline, while the Roman past appeared as a period of prosperous and rightful rule that had now been re- established by the French colonial masters.16 14 Fentress, Romanizing the Berbers; Mattingly, Being Roman; Mattingly, Africa: A landscape of opportunity; Mac- Mullen, Romanization, 30-50; Keay and Terrenato, Italy and the West; overview on ‘Romanization’ in Africa: Lepelley, L’Afrique; discussion of research between 1975 and 1995: Mattingly and Hitchner, Roman Africa; Stein- acher, When not in Rome, 442-445. 15 Mattingly, Imperialism, Power, and Identity, 55; cf.

              "7 Africa 500-1000. Introduction Another problematic issue is the certain tendency to study the macro-region of North Af- rica as a singular unity. Upcoming investigations should aim to create a regional perspective. In his recently-published study on Numidia in the early Roman period, Stefan Ardeleanu highlighted the heterogeneity of the evidence within the region. Previous research with its holistic approaches did not cover these nuances.17 The different regions are immensely varied in their set-ups. Africa Proconsularis was one of the most highly urbanized regions in the Imperium Romanum, while Numidia and Tripol- itania had, in addition to urban agglomerations, large rural hinterland areas. Early intensive surveys and non-stratigraphic excavations in the French and Italian colonial era produced an enormous number of archaeological sites but also the loss of large amounts of information. In contrast to the focus on the pre-Roman to Byzantine periods, the archaeology of the early Islamic period has attracted more attention in the last fifteen years.18 The concept of a “Romanized” belt of cities at the sea and tough resistance by local Berber tribes (labeled Mauri by the Romans) had become generally accepted since René Cagnat’s (1852-1937) study on the Roman occupation first published in 1892.19 In 1976, the French scholar Marcel Bénabou published his book La Résistance africaine à la romanisation and provided a concept of indigenous cultural endurance. It became “the most sophisticated exponent of the resistance thesis”.20 In Bénabou’s view, Africans had their own religious beliefs, and maintained their Punic or Libyan/African languages and personal names. Ro- mano-Africans demonstrated their “Africanness”. The controversies surrounding Bénabou’s early post-colonial ideas have been intense.21 Bonnie Effros’ contribution to this collection, A New Age of Saint Augustine? An- toine-Adolphe Dupuch, François Bourgade, and the Christians of North Africa (1838-1858), illustrates the background of early archaeological activity at the beginning of the colonial age in North Africa. Antoine-Louis-Adolphe Dupuch (1800-1856) served as the first Bish- op of Algiers in the newly conquered French colony. His contemporary François Bourgade (1806-1866), who served as a priest in both Algiers and Tunis, was a French missionary and philosopher. Both men were convinced that physical evidence of the late antique Christian past might lay a powerful historical foundation for religiosity in French North Africa. Arriv- ing in the 1830s, Dupuch and Bourgade labored under significantly different circumstances in North Africa from those enjoyed by their successors Charles Martial Allemand Lavigerie 17 Ardeleanu, Numidia Romana?. 18 Leone et al., Africa – Ifrīqiya Introduction, 1; Greenhalgh, Colonial Destruction; Effros, Incidental Archaeologists. 19 Cagnat, L’armée romaine d’Afrique. 20 Mattingly, From one Colonialism to another, 58-59. 21 Bénabou, La résistance africaine.

              "8 Roland Steinacher and Philipp Margreiter (1825-1892), the archbishop of Carthage and Algiers, and the White Father Paul-Albert Delattre (d. 1932). During military conflicts, these men were seeking to convert local Muslims, as well as mediating between Muslim and French military authorities. They also embarked on a quest for Christian remains, actions that transpired during brutal colonial repression of the indigenous population. These ancient monuments and artifacts became the mainstay of a colonialist narrative of the rebirth of Christianity in the lands made famous nearly one and a half millennia earlier by Saint Augustine of Hippo. North Africa between Vandal and Arab Rule As mentioned earlier, the Vandal period (AD 429-534) has been scrutinized in recent de- cades in several monographs, congress publications, essays, and exhibition catalogues.22 The subsequent Byzantine conquests have also been extensively studied through numerous publications on the political, military, and cultural history of the Justinianic age, including Procopius of Caesarea as the most important author of the 6th century. Research on post-Jus- tinianic North Africa is comparatively poor. Since Charles Diehl’s L’Afrique Byzantine of 1896, no overall monographic study of Byzantine North Africa (AD 534-698/709) has been published, which thus represents one of the major desiderata of contemporary North African studies. The period of the exarchate of Africa has received little attention in recent years, due to the limited source base and the lack of basic archaeological research. Andrew Merrills’ A Subaltern’s view of Early Byzantine Africa? Reading Corippus as His- tory analyses a major source shedding light on the early Byzantine occupation of North Af- rica (c.533-551). Corippus’ Iohannis is the last classical epic poem to be written in Latin. The poem has conventionally been viewed as an uncritical celebration of the imperial occupation, thanks to its classicizing imagery and the panegyric aspects of its celebration of recent mil- itary successes.23 Andrew Merrills argues that this celebration was tempered with a more critical re-telling of the first fifteen years of the Byzantine occupation. This is presented in a metadiegetic flashback, in the voice of an African officer in the imperial army of occupation. Merrills suggests that the catalogue of disasters presented here – internecine warfare, social upheaval and plague – reflects the ambivalent attitude of contemporary Africans to the oc- cupation itself. Merrills’ contribution touches on another desideratum, the post-Roman Berber regna in the 5th and 6th centuries, for which Procopius and Corippus are our only sources. Chris- tian Courtois labeled them as “royaume berbères”.24 English scholars refer to them as “des- ert kingdoms”.25 These dominions were structurally heterogeneous entities that emerged at different times on the periphery of the Vandal Empire and were organized in post-Roman structures.26 The study of the Berbers is also linked to the study of non-sedentary, nomadic or pastoralist population groups in North Africa. Nomads and pastoralists play a far greater 22 Steinacher, Vandalen; Merrills and Miles, Vandals; Modéran and Perrin, Vandales; Roberto, Il secolo dei Vandali; Castritius, Die Vandalen; Vössing, Vandalen; Conant, Staying Roman; cf. now the precise overview from Conant, Vandals, 75-90. 23 Merrills, Byzantine Period, 402. 24 Courtois, Vandales, 325-352. 25 Brett and Fentress, Berbers, 77-79. 26 Steinacher, Vandalen, 259-267; Faure, The Army, 168; Merrills, Mauri; Syrbe, Civitates Nordafrika, 61-62. medieval worlds • No. 16 • 2022 • 3-25",
              "9 Africa 500-1000. Introduction role in the North African political and economic system than previously assumed. Historical as well as ethnological studies showed that these economical systems often functioned only as a complement to a complex state and sedentary population, since a permanent exchange of trade goods between mobile and settled populations is necessary.27 Also drift routes guar- anteed by the state for seasonal migrations were in the interest of both parties. During the Roman imperial period, the empire established the praefectus gentis, who guaranteed drift paths and grazing grounds to nomads, but also levied taxes and recruited auxiliary troops on behalf of the state.28 This complex interaction could be jeopardized by any change of rule, such as the Vandal or Byzantine conquest, and endanger the livelihood of the nomads and pastoralists. Against this background, the military conflicts with the Berbers in the 6th-8th centuries must be reconsidered in current and future research.29 In the 580s, the military and civilian administration of Africa finally merged, and Con- stantinople established the Exarchate of Carthage, which existed until the end of Byzan- tine rule. Under Emperor Maurice (582-602), the African exarchate encompassed nearly the territories that had formed Justinian’s prefecture of the year 533.30 After Egypt had been conquered by Arab armies in 641, they advanced into Cyrenaica a few years later and shortly afterwards into Byzacena. In 647, the Byzantine exarch Gregory tried to make himself em- peror and moved his capital to Sufetula (Sbeїtla) fighting the Arabs. It was not until around 670 that the Arabs became active again. Their commanders had founded Kairouan as an Is- lamic military camp in the Sahel, as the coasts were successfully defended by the Byzantines and the mountainous regions by the Berbers, sometimes even together. Carthage fell to the Arabs in 695.31 The charismatic Berber princess Kahena and her warriors from the Aurès put up fierce resistance but were defeated by the Umayyad Uqba ibn Nafi’. Even though the Arab conquest (AD 647-709) has been brought to the fore by the work of Walter Kaegi and has re- ceived focused attention in recent years, the transition from Byzantine to Arab rule remains an under-researched topic. The lack of Roman sources complicates the historical narrative of the late 6th and 7th centuries in many ways. Arabic sources that report on this period in turn date from much later centuries, which makes a closer critical examination of them no less important. Cityscapes and Housing in Transition North Africa’s cityscapes have been a well-studied subject in recent decades and showed a long-term transformation from the classical Roman city to the early medieval Arab towns.32 The classical urban elements and public spaces began to change in the late 4th and beginning of the 5th century.33 The religious impact on urban organization began in this century and ended in the 6th/7th century AD. In this period, the fora already lost or were in the process 27 Barth, Nomads, 9-10. 28 Steinacher, Vandalen, 265; Weiß, praefectus gentis, 101-116. 29 Steinacher, Vandalen, 260-262; Syrbe, Nomaden Nordafrika; Faure, The Army, 162-163. 30 Merrills, Byzantine Period, 392-394. 31 Merrills, Byzantine Period, 399-402. 32 For a broad overview of the transformation of late antique and early medieval urbanism in the West, see Wickham, Framing the Early Middle Ages, 591-692, on Africa in particular 635-644. 33 Dufton, Fentress, African Urbanism, 177. medieval worlds • No. 16 • 2022 • 3-25",
              "10 Roland Steinacher and Philipp Margreiter of losing their original function. In contrast to the urban change, North Africa shows ex- tensive economic prosperity within these cities in the 5th century. Church building took on monumental proportions in the 5th and 6th centuries in the North African provinces.34 Thus, the decline of “classical” urban elements did not necessarily affect the prosperity of cities and their inhabitants. Production areas moved into the former public buildings of the forum, baths or theatres, while the trend towards the growth of rural settlements can be observed in the surrounding areas of the cities.35 The transformation of urban life started in North Africa even before the Vandals. Private architecture was continuously used as before and survived, while theaters and amphitheaters were gradually abandoned. Public baths were variously repaired, but some also vacated. Pagan temples were closed in 398-399 by imperial decree and became areas for new occupation or simply provided building material. A new feature during the Vandal era is urban burials in abandoned areas and buildings.36 The Byzantine conquest seems to have had a direct impact on urban architecture in the 6th century. City laws aimed at reorganizing public and private space. Public areas in partic- ular were reclaimed by the state. Fortified complexes are recorded all over the North African provinces as a result of extensive building programs (e.g., Dougga, Haїdra, Timgad, Tébessa). The Byzantine fortifications were the most prominent features of the cityscapes and often built over former public buildings and areas, like fora, baths or theaters that had already lost their original function.37 Furthermore, the fortification of rural areas can also be observed. In addition to state or communal buildings, the rural population began to erect defensive and refuge buildings as well. The imitation of military quadriburgi and centenaria by the civilian population is doc- umented in Tripolitania.38 A regional study of Byzantine fortifications in the Dougga region, which examines military fortifications, city walls and rural defensive and refuge structures, as well as the subsequent use of these in the Arab period, is currently being conducted by Philipp Margreiter as part of his dissertation at the University of Erlangen and Mainz. De- spite Denys Pringle’s monograph on the Byzantine fortifications of North Africa, there is still no comprehensive study on the transformation of these buildings until the ribāts in Arab time.39 Since the late Roman period, the larger urban centers had begun to show signs of deur- banization and reduction. It is unclear whether the reduction of the towns by the Byzantine city walls also corresponds to the actually inhabited settlement area of the 6th century. Cities such as Leptis Magna or Sabratha diminished significantly and were finally abandoned in the late 7th or early 8th century.40 From the mid-sixth century onwards, urban housing in gen- eral became simpler.

              "11 Africa 500-1000. Introduction a frontier is clearly seen in the great port cities of Islamic North Africa, such as Tripoli, Tunis and Sousse, which had large, fortified harbor facilities for warships. At this time the North African coast was probably subject to increased Byzantine attacks. This might explain the reduction in number and size of coastal cities. This phenomenon can, however, be observed in Syria and Palestine as well.41 Most of the former Roman city centers were used as industrial or agrarian production complexes in the early Middle Ages, a process that had already started in the late Byzan- tine period. Corisande Fenwick showed the urban diversity in Islamic North Africa. After the conquest of Carthage by the Arabs in 698, the city ceded its rank as provincial capital to Kairouan and Tunis. This loss of importance was accompanied by a radical reduction in the size of the city. Few rural communities settled in the former metropolis during the early Middle Ages and settlement probably ceased completely in the 9th or 10th century. In Sbeїtla (Sufetula), continuous urban settlement can be traced until the 9th century, but the town was divided into a series of fortified complexes around three fortlets in the south, the forum, an anonymous temple, and the amphitheater in the north of the urban area. The new Islam- ic urban centers were characterized by a mosque, central marketplaces, or the governor’s residence.42 Ancient towns like Hadrumetum (Sousse), Sicca Veneria (El Kef), Vaga (Béja) or Oea (Tripoli) have remained important urban centers in the region until today. Because of the continuous settlement and modern buildings, these sites are nearly unstudied archaeo- logically. Data concerning medieval urban developments mostly derives from less important and smaller sites.43 Religions in Transition Christianity remained a major religion in North Africa, and churches dominated the urban landscape for centuries.44 Over time some churches were transformed into production areas, markets, and some eventually into mosques. The new Arabic settlers were seemingly placed in separated quarters, as in Volubilis, Tlemcen and Tahert, where we can identify changes in housing, eating and consumption practices in the 8th century.45 Architectural manifestations of Islamization are a main issue of archaeological research. In her contribution Islamizing Berber Lifestyles, Elizabeth Fentress demonstrates how Arabic house types in medieval North Africa can be traced back to settlers from the Arabian Peninsula. The spread of Islam in North Africa probably took place in several phases over centuries. Fentress attempts to capture a material aspect of Islamization among Berbers in residential architecture and dietary prac- tices. Like “Romanization”, “Islamization” came about by emulation, particularly among the 41 Fenwick, Classical cities Ifrīqiya, 142; Leone, Land, forts, harbours, 282-283; Kaegi, Muslim Expansion, 261-266. 42 Leone, Changing Townscapes, 286-287; Fenwick, Africa to Ifrīqiya, 15-16, 20-26; Conant, Forgotten transition, 15- 16, Fenwick, Classical cities Ifrīqiya, 142-149. 43 Witschel, Krise, Rezession, Stagnation, 285-306; Wickham, Framing the Early Middle Ages, 639-644; von Rummel, Transformation, 107; Fenwick, Classical cities Ifrīqiya, 138-139; Fenwick, Arab Conquest, 426-430. 44 Cf. generally Shaw, Sacred Violence; Fenwick, Arab Conquest, 433-434. 45 Fenwick, Africa to Ifrīqiya, 27-28. medieval worlds • No. 16 • 2022 • 3-25",
              "12 Roland Steinacher and Philipp Margreiter élites, by a slow change of the general habitus, with very different starting points for the Ara- bic and the Berber communities. Arab settlers and warriors conveyed Islam to newly-found- ed or organized cities such as Tunis, Kairouan, or Tripoli. During the 7th and 8th centuries, many Berber communities converted to Islam. In the first centuries of Islamic rule, a considerable part of the population remained Chris- tian and spoke Latin.46 African saints such as Cyprian, Felicitas or Perpetua were worshiped in different places around Europe.47 As late as the 10th century, forty-seven bisho prics ex- isted in Ifrīqiya. The papal chancellery in Rome corresponded with African bishops up until the 11th century.48 Christian communities in formerly Roman cities largely turned to Islam during the 9th and 10th centuries, as did the inhabitants of the steppe and desert zones. The process of Arabization was much faster than Islamization.49 Archaeologically, we can com- prehend this process partly through the construction of mosques and the decline of Christian ecclesiastical buildings.50 We can only partly describe Jewish life in North Africa. Archaeological and epigraphic remains at various sites provide evidence of Jewish communities during Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages. A cemetery containing several catacombs dating to the 3rd and 4th centuries at Gamarth near Carthage has been known since the 19th century, as well as the synagogue of Naro (Hammam-Lif) and roughly a dozen other Jewish houses of worship.51 Augustine mentions Jewish communities at Utica, Simittra, Thusurus, and Oea.52 Justinian’s government started to restrict religious life and among other things forbade the construction of synagogues. In 632 the Prefect of Africa enforced the baptism of members of the Jewish community. We know of hostilities between Jewish communities, the Heraclian dynasty and local Catholic clergy.53 Ibn Khaldun stated that the Jarawa and seven other Berber tribes were Judaized.54 Al-Kahina, the religious and military leader of resistance to the Muslim conquest of the Maghreb, was repeatedly identified as a Jewish princess. Modern research questioned this, as well as the existence of Jewish Berber groups in general.55 All in all, Jewish commu- nities acted together with the Christian majority, maybe also in fighting the Arab invaders. 46 Leisten, Afrika, 225-226; Lancel, Tunisie, 188-195 (Latin inscriptions after the 7th century); Lewicki, Une langue romane oubliée, 428-430; Seston, Sur les derniers temps; Talbi, Ifriqiya. 47 Conant, Europe and the African Cult of Saints; Wickham, Framing the early Middle Ages, 726-728. 48 Conant, Staying Roman, 362-370; Handley, End of African Christianity, 291-310; Courtois, Grégoire VII, 96-122, 193-226.; Hettinger, Beziehungen des Papsttums. 49 Leone et al., Africa – Ifrīqiya Introduction, 3. 50 Comparative studies on the Arab conquest and Islamization of North Africa and its citizens have appeared in re- cent years: Aillet et al., Islamisation et arabisation; Brett, Conversion Berbers; Fenwick, Early Islamic North Africa, 130-140. 51 Hirschberg, History of the Jews in North Africa, vol. 1: 21, 23; cemetery at Gamarth: 50; Taieb-Carlen, Jews of North Africa, 4-22. 52 Harkins, Nuancing Augustine’s Hermeneutical Jew. 53 Kaegi, Muslim Expansion, 84-91 and notes 54-55, 292-293; Chouraqui, Between east and west; Stillman, Jews of Arab Lands; Gubbay and Levy, The Sephardim; Rachmuth, Juden in Nordafrika. 54 Kitāb al-ʿIbar 6, 107, ed.

              "13 Africa 500-1000. Introduction The Rural Landscape in Transition In contrast to the extensively excavated urban sites, only a handful of rural sites have been well studied.56 Another major challenge is to distinguish between urban and rural sites in Late Antiquity and early medieval North Africa. In less urbanized regions of Tripolitania, southern Byzancena, Numidia or Mauretania, archaeologists can clearly differentiate be- tween urban and rural landscapes, whereas in more densely urbanized regions (e. g. the hin- terland of Africa Proconsularis), this distinction proves much more difficult. Furthermore, the territories of urban settlements bordered on private or imperial estates, tribal lands, or confederations of smaller settlements.57 The difference between a city and its surrounding territory was not dependent on size or production centers, but rather on legal status as well as a concentration of administrative, economic, cultural, and religious features. Cities provided markets and agricultural centers. Ancient and medieval North Africa has been studied through several important surveys that broadly examined both urban and rural regions. Beginning in the French colonial period, large-scale documentation by the military formed the basis of the Atlas archéologique de l’Algérie and the Atlas archéologique de la Tunisie, targeted regional surveys in the 20th and 21st centuries documenting the pre-Roman, Roman and Islamic sites. In Libya, the UNESCO Survey and its successor projects have investigated the coastal hinterland and the Saharan region. In Tunisia, surveys focused primarily on the northern half of the country, both in the coastal and inland regions.58 Surveys around Carthage,59 in the Segermes Valley60 and the region around Dougga61 show that the inhabited space inside the urban settlements was reduced from the 4th century onwards, while the number of rural sites remained stable and peaked in the 5th and 6th cen- turies, followed by a fast decline in the 7th century. Philipp von Rummel suggests that while the cityscapes changed quickly, agricultural production remained stable, as shown by the large numbers of rural farm sites. Furthermore, von Rummel pointed out that this picture could be distorted by the dependence on fine ware for dating. Other regions like Byzancena, the coastal region of Tripolitania, or the region of Kasserine (Cillium) in North Africa were subject to different processes.62 Some regions were abandoned in the 5th, 6th or 7th cen- turies; others were populated until the Arab conquest or beyond.63 56 For an overview on field surveys in North Africa, see Leone, Rural landscapes, 135-151. 57 von Rummel, Transformation, 108; de Vos Raaijmakers and Attoui, Rus Africum I-IV; De Vos Raaijmakers, Rural Settlement, 205. 58 For a summary of archaeological surveys in North Africa and their methodological challenges and possibilities, see Stone, Comparative Survey, 132-143. 59 Green, Atlas archéologique Tunisie; Green, Carthage Survey; Green, Canadian Carthage Survey; Green, Carthag- inian Countryside. 60 Dietz et al., Africa Proconsularis. 61 De Vos Raaijmakers and Attoui, Rus Africum I. 62 Von Rummel, Transformation; Hitchner, Kasserine Survey 1982-1986; Hitchner, Kasserine Survey 1987. 63 Leone, Rural landscapes, 151-154, 156; von Rummel, Transformation, 109-110; Fenwick, Arab Conquest, 431-432. medieval worlds • No. 16 • 2022 • 3-25",
              "14 Roland Steinacher and Philipp Margreiter Fortified farms and villages have been perceived by researchers as a characteristic of rural settlement patterns in late antique North Africa that distinguishes these regions from others in the Roman Empire.64 The emergence of fortified rural landscapes can be attributed to sev- eral causes: increasing insecurity in the provinces due to raids and depredations by nomadic tribal groups; troop reductions leading to the replacement of regular units by a militarized rural population; the display of status and influence within rural societies; as a symptom of an increase in violence (real or latent) within the Roman provinces; and as a general side effect of the decline of the state’s monopoly on defense and violence along the southern frontiers.65 Looking at the longue durée perspective of these constructions, it is noticeable that for- tified rural settlements are the norm rather than the exception in North Africa already be- tween the 1st century BC and the 1st century AD. Only the Roman imperial period and the accompanying Pax Romana constitute a break in this practice.66 Fortifications and intramu- ral fortresses were again a defining feature in early medieval cities. The Byzantine fortress- es were repurposed for Arab garrisons. Some fortified sites were newly erected. The Arabs based their defensive system on the Byzantine one, adapted it and built new forms. Early medieval Ifrīqiya was an intensely militarized landscape. Most major towns were garrisoned by Arab troops. By the end of the 8th century, ribāts, a new type of fortification, were con- structed along the Tunisian coastline.67 Integration into the Islamic World In the 7th century, the Byzantine Empire was gripped by a crisis in which it was no longer able to effectively control some of its provinces. To understand the Arab conquest, one has to consider these backgrounds.68 This slow process of recurrent invasions and conquests over a period of 50 years can be observed at various levels: urban topography, buildings, economy and trade, and social structures.69 Again, a new military elite had taken over – a common occurrence in North African history.70 However, the attempt at a fast integration of the former Roman provinces into the ca- liphate failed. In 739-743 Berber confederacies rebelled against taxation under the Umayyad dynasty. During the first decades of Abbāsid rule, regional dynasties such as the Rustamids in 761 or the Idrīsids in 789 established separate states.

Still, Islamic North Africa poses a variety of problems for modern historical and archaeological scholars. At the same time, the region is well suited to studying Arabic empire building, as well as Islamization. Finally, changes in urban, economic, and cultural structures in the Maghreb can be described in more detail than in Mesopotamia or Syria. Economic Changes Early on, archaeology revealed the economic links of North Africa within the ancient Mediter- ranean world. After a last economic boom in the region, exports slowly began to decline from the 5th century onwards. After the Byzantine conquest, African amphorae started to become rare in the Mediterranean. Exports of African red slip ware (ARS) to Constantinople and the Aegean remained strong until the 6th and 7th centuries. African red slip ware also continued to reach the major urban metropolises of the East, such as Alexandria, Antioch, Beirut, and Caesarea. In turn, eastern amphorae reached North Africa until the 7th century. In the West- ern Mediterranean, African red slip ware can be recorded in urban centers, as well as military posts, until the 6th and 7th, and in some cases even the 8th century. The widespread use of the ARS thus shows that North Africa was an important economic center in the Mediterra- nean region even after the Arab conquest, and that it continued to have connections to the most important cities. Written sources report on the trade of clothing and textiles in North Africa. A particularly long connection seems to have existed between North Africa, Sicily, and Italy, even at a time when all other trans-Mediterranean contacts broke off. However, the main methodological problem in the study of trade contacts lies in dating the ceramic evidence in medieval layers. The Dougga Survey of Mariette de Vos showed the end of classic fine ware dating methods and the gradual substitution by local production types.73 Further regional and local pottery studies were able to shed more light on the extent and chronology of Africa’s economic decline at the end of Antiquity.74 The numismatic evidence presents a different picture with a supra-regional connection to various Mediterranean currencies. A sharp decline in the African economy cannot be detected in the Late Byzantine period. The 7th century clearly shows an increase in gold issues, a high level of internal monetization and a continued exchange with the West until at least 700.75 71 Fenwick, Africa to Ifrīqiya, 33. 72 Fenwick, Early Islamic North Africa, 2. 73 Fenwick, Early Islamic North Africa, 1-4; de Vos, Terra, acqua, olio, 38-46, 56, 71. 74 Reynolds, From Vandal Africa, 129-158, 168-170; Conant, Forgotten transition, 11-13; Leone, Cultural transitions, 265; Leone, Land, forts, harbours, 290; Bonifay, Economy. 75 Morrisson, African economy, 198; Merrills, Byzantine Period, 395-398; Morrisson, Coinage in Africa. medieval worlds • No. 16 • 2022 • 3-25",
              "16 Roland Steinacher and Philipp Margreiter The economic and cultural integration of Ifrīqiya into the Abbāsid Empire, and the Is- lamic world has received increasing attention in recent decades. Between the Arab conquest and the end of Aghlabid rule, we observe a shift in trade patterns in Ifrīqiya. Trade routes, markets and agricultural areas developed in response to the changing political regimes and economic relations.76 The changing trade patterns between the 9th and the 11th century can be related to Ifrīqiya’s more intensive connection to the rest of the Abbāsid Empire and the social and economic reorientation of North Africa away from a Roman north-south focus and towards a more east-west orientation. Antonia Bosanquet’s article Maritime Trade from 3rd/9th- century Ifrīqiya: Insights from Legal Sources deals with literary sources, especially legal texts on maritime trade in North Africa from the 9th century onwards. In connection with trade, ribāts emerged along the coastline and significant coastal settlements emerged from these fortified complexes during the 10th century, which played a major role as a stopover between al-Andalus and the Middle East. Sicily – A Look Over the Edge In several contributions to this volume and to the original conference, Sicily, as the closest Mediterranean island, proved to be an important comparative example for many long-term processes of Late Antiquity and the early Middle Ages that took place in North Africa be- tween AD 500 and 1000. Long before Sicily became part of the Islamic world, trade and exchange contacts existed between Byzantines and Muslims on the island. The urban, rural, economic, or social changes between AD 500 and 1000 were strongly influenced by North Africa.77 First raids from Carthage started in 652, followed by a long series of conflicts from 827 to 902 in which the island was conquered step by step by Aghlabids and Fatimids. The exact circumstances of the 9th-century conquest and the extent of local Byzantine resistance are still largely unknown.78 As in North Africa, new urban centers such as Balarm (Palermo) emerged under Islamic rule.79 Latin- and Greek-speaking Christians dispersed to the west and east of the island, as did a sizable Jewish population. Several waves of migration from North Africa brought Sunni and Shiite Arabs as well as Berbers to the island.80 Under the Kalbids, who constituted the Emiral dynasty in 948, Sicily even experienced a period of stability and economic prosperity. Palermo developed as one of the largest and richest cities of the Mediterranean at the time.81 Research shows that even late antique inland Sicily was connected to a broader Mediter- ranean network and exchange system. African tableware (ARS) and amphorae were widely scattered in the hinterland. During the 8th and 9th centuries, these exchanges declined, and 76 Fenwick, Arab Conquest, 431-433. 77 Davis-Secord, Sicily, 6-11, 72-73. 78 Granara, Muslim Sicily, 4, 9-10; Molinari, Sicily, 335-336. 79 Granara, Muslim Sicily, 12. 80 Comparative studies on the transformation and Islamization of Sicily in the Middle Ages have appeared in the last years: Aillet et al., Islamisation et arabisation; Arcifa et al., Dynamiques l’islamisation; Cressier and Nef, Fatimides. 81 Granara, Muslim Sicily, 25-26, 34; Molinari, Sicily, 349-350.

              "17 Africa 500-1000. Introduction local production methods and ceramic forms emerged. Syracuse continued to be linked to the eastern Mediterranean. The ceramic repertoire of the 10th century resembles contem- porary Tunisian tableware. Palermo, together with Fustat and Kairouan, formed one of the great centers of the Fatimid Empire’s commercial networks.82 Rural settlement in the Byzantine and Islamic periods, on the other hand, is much better studied in Sicily. A series of surveys and a small number of systematic excavations allow insight into the transformation of the Sicilian rural landscape. Between the 3rd and the 5th centuries, we can trace a process of “monumentalization” of villas, a sign of the wealth of the owners, and of the reorganization of the agrarian system. From the 4th or 5th to the 8th century, some villas were still reoccupied. Other were reused in different ways for burials, as new housing estates, for technical or agricultural activities or as places of worship.83 The Byzantine period is known in the eastern half of the island in the 8th and 9th centuries due to ceramic evidence. The Sicilian countryside was, compared to other Mediterranean regions, economically extremely vibrant until the 7th century. The settlement landscape was domi- nated by smaller villages. The 8th century, on the other hand, produced few material indica- tors. Following Arab attacks, Byzantine fortresses appeared. However, the rural population does not seem to have retreated to these fortified centers in this period.84 The two regions Africa and Sicily underwent similar transformation processes between AD 500 and 1000 under different conditions, which affected the landscape, the economy, and the multi-ethnic and multi-religious population. The highlighting of this transformation in Africa/Ifrīqiya and also in Sicily/Ṣiqilliya will have to be considered in future historical and archaeological research. Summary Most of the archaeological research in North Africa focuses on long-term processes and structural changes. The developments in urban and rural areas, such as the increasing reduc- tion of urban area and the increase in rural settlement and economic goods, began as early as the 4th century and continued into the Arab era. The economic prosperity of the Vandal kingdom is evident in the export of important goods to the western, but also to the east- ern Mediterranean, through the African amphorae and the African red slip ware. Similarly, trans-regional fine tableware remained widespread in North Africa until the beginning of the Early Byzantine period. During the late 6th and 7th centuries, the distribution within North Africa but also in the Mediterranean region diminished. The return to local and regional tableware makes it difficult to date it to the early Islamic period.85 While Vandal rule left few material traces, we see architectural restructuring in many cities in the Byzantine period, mainly in the fortification of the city centers and the construc- tion of castra and city walls. During the 6th and 7th centuries, some urban centers, some of which had existed since pre-Roman times, were abandoned, while others still exist today as modern metropolises. Settlement centers disintegrated into smaller clusters or nuclei that made up only a fraction of the imperial city area.

              "18 Roland Steinacher and Philipp Margreiter Tunis set new accents in urban development for the Arab and Muslim population. In addition to these long-term developments in Late Antiquity, new processes in settlement, religious and consumption archaeology can be observed from the beginning of Arab rule on.86 Recent research shows that the Islamic conquest in the first centuries hardly inter- fered with urban life and Arab immigration was concentrated in the Kairouan area. Only a new military elite had come to power. Thus, today’s Tunisia became the heartland of Arab Ifrīqiya, as it had previously been that of Vandal and Byzantine Africa. The wali, the Arab governor, succeeded the Byzantine exarch. This Arab office comprised similar competences in military and administrative matters. After 800, the economic potential of Ifrīqiya grew again, perhaps even exceeding that of Late Antiquity. The emergence of new cultural realities, now oriented towards Damascus, Baghdad and Cairo rather than Rome or Constantinople, was a long and gradual process.

The same can be said for Spain, tain increasing numbers of coins minted in the Eastern Africa, and Gaul in the following decades. But after AD 440, Empire, mainly from Constantinople.

The most logical conclusion to draw from this dies or through consensual processes of buying and selling at- picture is that the Roman-Italian emperors of the 5th century tested in several sources for the 6th and 7th centuries.126 increasingly acted in a similar way to other non-imperial client It seems that gold flowed both inside and outside of the kingdoms of Constantinople in Western, Central, or North- Empire according to the necessities and the relations of dif- ern Europe.

These regions have been chosen partly because they are very different from each other: the north with its hills and valleys is a transitional region between the Mediterranean and the interior, while the south is largely steppe bordering on the desert. In late antiquity, Syria was a rich and important province of a great empire, as it had been for centuries. As late as 570, it was described as the place where all the nobility of Syria resided. The archaeological record of the region south of Syria, in modern Jordan, suggests that notions of widespread destruction by the Persians are extremely exaggerated and that life went on much as it had before.This chapter examines city and country alike in two widely separated regions of Syria: the Orontes Valley with two of the greatest cities, Antioch and Apamea, and the country around them, and one lesser city, Epiphania; and the Hauran with its metropolis, Bostra.

        "paragraph": "Recent studies of early Islamic Palestine have stressed the minimal impact of the Arab conquest on the Christian communities of the region. None, however, have sought to trace the trajectories of these communities beyond the eighth century. This thesis provides the first long-term study of the impact of the Arab conquest on monasticism and pilgrimage between 614 and 950. The study explores the changes to the physical landscape of monasteries and Christian cult sites, in terms of site abandonment and continuity, and situates these processes in the broader political and economic context of the Palestinian region between the seventh and tenth centuries. This thesis offers a systematic critique of current theories which view Palestinian monasticism and Christian pilgrimage as social entities dependent upon patronage from Byzantium and the early medieval west. Rather, it stresses the need for a more nuanced recognition of monastic communities and Christian cult sites as places closely interlinked with localised developments and the high degree of variation between communities in terms of patron economies and social transactions. This study demonstrates that these variances often provide the key to understanding the highly varied response of Palestinian monastic communities and Christian cult sites to early Muslim rule.Recent studies of early Islamic Palestine have stressed the minimal impact of the Arab conquest on the Christian communities of the region.

This study demonstrates that these variances often provide the key to understanding the highly varied response of Palestinian monastic communities and Christian cult sites to early Muslim rule."
